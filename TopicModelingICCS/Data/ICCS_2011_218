Abstract
In this work we explore the reactivity induced by coordination of a CO molecule trans to the Ru-benzylidene bond of a prototype
Ru-olefin metathesis catalyst bearing the N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand SIMes. Static DFT calculations indicate that CO
binding to the Ru center promotes a cascade of reactions with very low energy barriers that lead to the final crystallographically
characterized product, in which the original benzylidene group has attacked the proximal aromatic ring of the SIMes ligand
leading to a cycloheptatriene through a Buchner ring expansion. In conclusion, it consists of a carbene insertion into a mesityl
group of the second generation Grubbs carbene complex. Instead of simply occupying open coordination sites, the ligand pushes
the ruthenium-bound carbene into a position-selective cyclopropanation and rearrangement reaction manifold giving a
cycloheptatriene ring, i.e. a Buchner reaction. The insertion may prove useful to identify carbene intermediates in enyne
metathesis. Both carbon monoxide and isocyanides promote the cyclopropanation experimentally, that a computational analysis
of the relevant molecular orbitals illuminates the key role of the ʌ-acid CO coordinated trans to the Ru-benzylidene bond to
promote this reactivity. Results clearly indicate that a ʌ-acidic group, as CO, that can approach the Ru center in the sterically
crowded position trans to the Ru-benzylidene bond can promote this deactivation route.

1. Introduction
Ru-catalyzed olefin metathesis is on the verge to make the big leap from a flexible synthetic tool in the academy
to a variety of large scale applications of great economic return in the industry.[1] However, one of the drawbacks
slowing this step still is the scarce stability of otherwise quite active N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) based 2nd
generation catalysts.[2] The greater activity of NHC-based catalysts is now rather well understood,[3] while
knowledge about their stability is still scarce.[4,5] One of the reasons for this limited understanding is that academic

groups usually focus on the more rewarding improvement of activity and/or selectivity of a catalyst, since more or
less rational strategies can be followed, rather than investing resources to follow catalyst deactivation along
unexplored pathways. Nevertheless, seminal computational efforts have confirmed experimental insights, such as
that one deactivation pathway starts with the activation of an aromatic ortho C-H bond of the N-substituents of the
NHC ligand.[5,6] The emerging picture is that stable catalysts must be protected in the ortho position to avoid this
deactivation pathway. This immediately explains the increased stability of catalysts with mesityl N-substituents.
However, the increased stability is accompanied by inferior performances in the formation of tetrasubstituted C=C
bonds. A solution to this impasse has been the synthesis of catalysts with o-tolyl N-substituents. The single o-methyl
stabilizes the catalyst without degrading performances in challenging synthesis.[7] Another solution is the synthesis
of NHC ligands tetramethyl substituted on the saturated NHC skeleton, with the precise idea that the bulky NHC
skeleton should prevent free rotation around the N-aryl bond, thus shutting off the C-H deactivation pathway.[8]
Broadly speaking, deactivation pathways are those chemicals transformations of the (pre)catalyst or the active
species that remove them from productive metathesis. In this sense, Diver, Keister, and co-workers[9] have clearly
shown that addition of ʌ acids such as CO or isocyanides to a solution of typical second-generation catalysts can
switch a metathesis catalyst into a cyclopropanation catalyst,[10] by activating the Ru-ylidene bond to a carbene-like
reactivity. This promotes ylidene attack to the proximal N-bonded aromatic ring of the NHC ligand, which results in
a Buchner type ring expansion reaction; see Scheme 1.

Scheme 1.

Although it is difficult to call the reaction of Scheme 1 a deactivation reaction, since CO is not normally added
during metathesis, understanding the chemistry behind this transformation is relevant for the following reasons. (1)
ʌ-Acids are inevitably present during metathesis, and any organometallic textbook presents educative comparisons
between the ı-basic/ʌ-acid properties of CO, olefins and phosphines. Clearly, olefins and phosphines are much
weaker ʌ-acids than CO, but a reduced acidity could still induce slow deactivation reactions as those shown in
Scheme 1 for CO. (2) A clear understanding of the changes in the chemical behavior promoted by a ı-basic/ʌ-acid
ligand trans to the Ru-ylidene bond would expand our knowledge of the chemistry of Ru-based catalysts with
possible consequences in the design of new ligands with tuned properties. However, a clear rationalization of the
beneficial effect of these ligand synthesis strategies is missing, and considering the potential improvements in this
direction, we decided to perform a DFT analysis of this C-H (de)activation key step on the systems shown in
Scheme 2.

Scheme 2.

Indeed, the position trans to the Ru-ylidene bond has been scarcely considered during the years.[3,11] For example,
Grubbs and co-workers have suggested that one of the ortho-F atoms of the NHC A shown in Scheme 2 could be

1224

engaged in an interaction with the Ru center that results in increased metathesis activity.[12] Furthermore, strategies
for the synthesis of (pre)catalysts having labile ligands that could result in more stable and active catalysts, such as
B and C of Scheme 2 explored.[13] For these reasons we decided to investigate computationally the reactivity
changes induced by CO coordinated trans to the Ru-benzylidene bond, i.e. the reaction in Scheme 1. Calculations
we present are based on a classical static density functional theory (DFT) approach. In recent studies it was
demonstrated that for a series of ı-basic/ʌ-acid ligands coordinated trans to a Ru-methylidene bond of the systems, a
quite acidic ligand was enough to produce such a decomposition of the olefin metathesis catalyst.[9a,14] Here we
plan to enlarge the application of these insights from the Ru-methylidene to the Ru-benzylidene group. Such a
systematic comparison should increase our understanding of the basic properties of the Ru-ylidene bond and of the
reactivity changes that could in principle be induced by changes in the nature of the ligands connected to the Ru
atom.
2. Computational Details
All the DFT static calculations were performed at the GGA level with the Gaussian03 set of programs,[15] using
the BP86 functional of Becke and Perdew.[16] The electronic configuration of the molecular systems was described
with the standard split-valence basis set with a polarization function of Ahlrichs and co-workers for H, C, N, O, P, F,
and Cl (SVP keyword in Gaussian).[17] For Ru we used the small-core, quasi-relativistic Stuttgart/Dresden effective
core potential, with an associated (8s7p6d)/[6s5p3d] valence basis set contracted according to a (311111/22111/411)
scheme (standard SDD keywords in gaussian03).[18] The geometry optimizations were performed without
symmetry constraints. The Synchronous Transit-Guided Quasi-Newton (STQN) Method, developed by H. B.
Schlegel and coworkers, was used to calculate the transition states. This method is requested with the QST3
keyword.[19] The characterization of the located stationary points was performed by analytical frequency
calculations. Mainly Solvent effects including contributions of nonelectrostatic terms have been estimated in singlepoint calculations on the gas phase optimized structures, based on the polarizable continuous solvation model PCM
using CH2Cl2 as a solvent.[20] In conclusion, the energies reported correspond to the “Total free energy in solution:
with all non electrostatic terms” value in the Gaussian output. Previous studies have revealed that this scheme of
calculation provides excellent results.[21]
3. Results
Product 7, shown in Figure 1, is the only species for which X-ray data are available from the reaction pathway
that drives from precatalyst 1 to 7 described in Figure 2,[9a] apart from species 1 too. Geometrical analysis indicates
that the computed structure 7 is in excellent agreement with the crystallographic structure, with a rmsd of 0.039 Å
for distances and of 0.9° for angles.[22,23] This also indicates that the sterically demanding PCy3 phosphine can be
safely replaced with the less bulkier PMe3 phosphine to shed light on this kind of reactions.

In Figure 2, we begin discussing the effect of a CO molecule coordinated trans to the Ru-benzylidene bond, since
clean experimental data are available for this system. Starting from precatalyst 1, the first step corresponds to
coordination of a CO molecule to the vacant coordination position trans to the Ru-benzylidene bond. The binding
energy of the CO molecule to the Ru atom in 2 is 25.7 kcal/mol. Coordination of the CO molecule has a strong
effect on the Ru-benzylidene bond, which elongates from 1.852 Å in 1 to 1.989 Å in 2, and pushes the phosphine
almost perfectly trans to the NHC ligand, with a small elongation (less than 0.05 Å) of the Ru-NHC and Ru-P
bonds. CO coordination also results in the remarkable reduction of the NHC-Ru-benzylidene angle from 103.3° in 1
to 96.1° in 2, thus increasing the proximity of the reactive benzylidene group with the proximal aromatic ring of the
SIMes ligand (the Cbenzylidene-Cipso distance reduces from 3.109 to 2.819 Å).
As already indicated, benzylidene attack to one of the aromatic rings of the SIMes ligand with formation of a
cycloheptatriene type ring corresponds to a classical Buchner ring expansion reaction. To rationalize the activation
role of the CO, Diver and coworkers suggested that CO binding may weaken ʌ-back-bonding between the Ru atom
and the ylidene ligand, making the latter more electrophilic and disengaging it from the metal center. Results can be
summarized considering that the molecular orbital (MO) diagram of complexes 1 and 2 reported in Figure 3 reveals
clearly which is the role of CO. In the precatalyst 1 the classical Fischer carbene bonding scheme is established.[24]
Electron density is donated from filled d orbitals on the Ru to the empty ʌ orbital of the benzylidene. Differently, in
the presence of the strong ʌ-acid CO molecule, electron density from the Ru is more strongly donated to ʌ-acid MOs
of the CO. As suggested by Diver, this depletes electron density from the ʌ orbital of the benzylidene, which is able
to accept from the properly oriented ʌ orbital of the Cipso atom of the proximal ring, resulting in a very low barrier
for formation of the Cbenzylidene-Cipso bond.

Fig. 3. Main orbitals in complexes 1 and 2 involved in the deactivation pathway by CO (H atoms have been omitted and benylidene group has
been replaced by methylidene for the sake of clarity).

First of all, with the absence of CO trans to the Ru-methylidene bond, i.e. in system 1, the metallacycle structure
3 of Figure 2 is not stable. All our attempts to locate a metallacycle structure similar to 3 in the absence of the CO
ligand failed, and the geometry optimization collapsed into the starting species 1.
At species 2 the cyclopropanation reaction between the benzylidene group and one of the Cipso-Cortho bonds of the
nearby mesityl ring occurs in two steps. The former corresponds to attack of the benzylidene group to the Cipso atom,
which requires overcoming a barrier of 7.1 kcal/mol and leads to 3, which still presents a Ru-benzylidene bond and
is 6.8 kcal/mol less stable than 2 (Figure 2). The second step of the cyclopropanation reaction requires the complete

Albert Poater et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1222–1229

1227

rupture of the the previously Ru-benzylidene bond with the concerted formation of a cyclopropane ring by attack of
the Cbenzylidene atom to one of the Cortho atoms of the mesityl ring. This step requires overcoming a barrier of 20.5
kcal/mol, after which the system collapses into the intermediate 4. This species 4 is 7.6 kcal/mol above in energy
with respect to species 2, with CO coordinated, due to higher sterical hindrance. However species 4 is 18.1 kcal/mol
more stable than species 1.
Due to the fact that intermediate 4 presents a vacant coordination position trans to the CO it allows the
coordination of another molecule of CO, which is a barrierless process and leads to intermediate 5. The binding
energy of the second CO molecule, 19.5 kcal/mol, is comparable but slightly lower to the binding energy of the first
CO in 2, 25.7 kcal/mol. At this point, the only step needed to form the experimentally observed product is the
opening of the Cipso-Cortho bond of the tensioned cyclopropane ring of 5, which leads to species 6, overcoming a
small energy barrier, 1.9 kcal/mol in this case. Finally a concerted movement of the cycloheptatriene to rotate the
new benzylic group pointing farther with respect to the metal releases 5.6 kcal/mol, reaching product 7. On the other
hand, we also examined the cyclopropane opening in the absence of a second CO molecule coordinated to the Ru
atom. In this case the somewhat larger barrier of 4.1 kcal/mol must be passed, after which the system collapses into
intermediate 8. After this cyclopropane ring is opened, i.e. species 7, and then flipping the benzyilic group pointing
farther with respect to the center of the catalyst, coordination of a second CO molecule leads to the formation of the
final product 7. Considering the small energy barrier for the 4Æ8 step, it is possible that coordination of the second
CO molecule occurs after the ring expansion step. However considering an atmosphere of CO with a pressure of 1
atm it seems more reasonable to avoid this alternative mechanism.
4. Conclusions
Inspired by the experimental results of Diver and co-workers,[9a] who explored the reactivity induced by
coordination of CO to the Ru atom of typical NHC-based olefin metathesis catalysts, we clarified the mechanistic
details of this transformation for Ru-benzylidene complex. Our calculations clearly indicate that CO binding to the
Ru center promotes a cascade of reactions with low energy barriers that lead to the final crystallographically
characterized product. It is necessary to point out that the formation of the cyclopropane species requires to
overcome a relatively high energy barrier. We are currently studying the alternative ways to get a lower energy
barrier for this step.
Analysis of the relevant MOs illuminates the key role of the ʌ-acid CO coordinated trans to the Ru-benzylidene
bond. Basically, it attracts electron density from the Ru, which results in reduced Ru backdonation to the ʌ MO on
the benzylidene group. The reduced electron density on the ʌ MO of the benzylidene group allows for a favorable
interaction with the ʌ-aromatic system of the proximal mesityl group, which leads to metallacycle formation first
and subsequently in the formation of a tensioned cyclopropane structure that finally evolves to an intermediate with
a cycloheptatriene via a Buchner type ring expansion, thus allowing the carbene insertion into a mesityl group of a
second generation Grubbs carbine complex. Then to reach the experimental product it is necessary the rotation of
the past carbene to point its new benzylic group farther with respect to the center of the catalyst to reduce the overall
sterical hindrance of the catalyst.
