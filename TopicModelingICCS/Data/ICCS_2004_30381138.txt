Abstract. In the present paper routing and wavelength assignment
(RWA) in optical WDM networks is discussed. Previous techniques on
based on the integer linear programming and graph coloring are complex
and require extensive use of heuristics which makes them slow and sometimes practically not reasonable. Another approach employs the greedy
algorithm for obtaining available edge disjoint paths. Even though it is
fast, it produces a solution for any connection request which is far from
the optimal utilization of wavelengths. We propose a novel algorithm
which is based on the maximum ﬂow to have the maximum quantity
of edge disjoint paths. Comprehensive computer simulation shows that
the proposed method outperforms previous ones signiﬁcantly in terms of
running time. Furthermore, it shows compatible or better performance
comparing to others in number of wavelengths used.

Introduction

Among various research areas in optical networks, eﬃcient source-destination
routing and assigning a wavelength on the route selected are quite important
for the network performance [1]. Their objectives include the minimization of
the required number of wavelengths [2,3,4], the minimization of the blocking
probability under ﬁxed number of wavelengths [5], and the minimization of the
network costs [6].
Routing and wavelength assignment (RWA) problem for the lightpaths of
virtual topology in any WDM network is NP complete and many heuristic
approaches [2,3,4,5,6] have been proposed in the literature. It has been studied
for various criteria. One criterion of them is how to set up and release optical
paths. Here we assume the static path assignment that optical paths are not
released after once established. In static wavelength assignment the lightpaths
and their routes are known in advance and we need to assign wavelengths to each
lightpath such that the lightpath on a given link must have diﬀerent wavelengths.

That is practically more achievable with the current technology than the dynamic
path assignment, where optical paths are randomly set up and released.
Another criterion is the existence of wavelength converters. Physical constraints in the RWA problem include wavelength channel spacing in a ﬁber link,
the number of optical transceivers, and the number of wavelength converters. Actually they determine the number of wavelengths available on ﬁber links and thus
the number of source-to-destination connections. Each wavelength is assumed to
be assigned to a single channel and the bandwidth granularity of the channel is
usually not considered for the simplicity of the problem. This paper investigates
the case that no wavelength converters exist in the topology based on the static
path assignment. It is predictable that the proposed scheme can easily apply to
the case with wavelength converters. And the goal of this work is either to reduce
the number of used wavelengths or to maintain the similar number with shorter
running time. This can be achieved based on the maximum number of edge disjoint paths. The comprehensive computer simulation shows that the proposed
scheme signiﬁcantly outperforms other schemes in terms of the running time.
Basically there are two approaches for solving the RWA problem. The ﬁrst
approach is based on the lpsolver [7], which is a program to solve a linear program
using the idea of multicommodity ﬂows, to obtain the optimal solution for RWA.
And the second one uses path selection based graph algorithms to minimize the
number of wavelengths used heuristically. We brieﬂy mention three popular RWA
algorithms in the literature.
Lpsolver: Routing Heuristic Algorithm with Graph Coloring - Rounding
heuristic algorithm based on lpsolver is used in lightpath routing and graph
coloring is used in wavelength assignment phase [2]. Graph Algorithm: BGA for
EDP - A simple edge disjoint paths scheme based on shortest path algorithm to
identify available paths is used in [3]. Here authors investigate the performance
of rounding heuristic algorithm and their scheme in terms of the number of
wavelengths used and the actual running time. The result shows that the
number of wavelengths used in two schemes is almost same, however, rounding
heuristic algorithm consistently takes more time than that of BGA for EDP.
Therefore we just compare the proposed scheme with BGA for EDP in our
work. Graph Algorithm: RWA with Lookup Table - LTB RWA is based on
disjoint path set selection protocol (DPSP) [4,8]. Here authors investigate
the performance of BGA for EDP and their scheme in terms of the number
of wavelengths used and the running time. The simulation result shows that
the number of wavelengths used in BGA for EDP is almost same. However,
LTB RWA yields better solutions for the running time.

The Proposed RWA Scheme

Let G(V, E) denote a simple graph that models a network, where V is the vertex
set and E is the edge set. Let |V | = n, i.e. a network contains n hosts. The demand set D is a set of pairs {(s1 , t1 ), . . . , (sk , tk )}, where si , ti ∈ V, i = 1, . . . , k.
Here k is the total number of requests for connections, si is a host-sender, and ti

1140

is a host-receiver. For the request (si , ti ) it is necessary to assign a wavelength λi
and a lightpath Li ⊆ E (which means that edges in the lightpath are elements
in E). Let us remark the lightpaths that are assigned the same wavelength simultaneously will not traverse the same physical link, i.e. these paths are edge
disjoint. Let l = maxi λi . The aim of RWA problem is to minimize l under the
condition Li Lj = ∅, ∀i, j ∈ {1, . . . , k}. If the condition is false, then we say
the assignment is not admissible.
If s1 = s2 = . . . = sk = s and t1 = t2 = . . . tk = t, then the optimal solution
for the problem is deﬁned as k over the maximal number of edge disjoint paths
between s and t, i.e. k divided by the cardinality of the edge cut set between s
k
and t, Card(s, t). i.e., Optimal number of wavelengths = Card(s,t)
Let us assume an optical network (refer to Fig. 1 (a)). Shortest path is
assigned to the connection request. Let the demand set be {(1,4),(4,1),(2,3)}.
First random selected request is (1,4). The shortest path between node 1 and 4
is 1→2→3→4. Hence the request (1,4) receives wavelength λ = 1 and uses path
1→2→3→4. We remove this path from graph and get unconnected graph. Paths
for other connections do not exist (see Fig. 1 (b)). Now we return to the original
graph and increase the number of wavelength, i.e. λ = 2. Let a second random
selected request be (4,1). Shortest path is 4→3→2→1. Hence connection (4,1)
uses this path with wavelength 2. We have no path for the demand (2,3). So
we use wavelength 3 for this request. As a result, we use diﬀerent wavelength
for each connection, i.e. max λ = 3. However, if connection (1,4) uses path
1→5→6→3→4, (4,1) uses 4→8→7→2→1, (2,3) use 2→3, then max λ = 1.
As we all know, ring topology is one of important network architectures. Let
a network be as in Fig. 1 (c). Let a demand set be {(1, 2), (6, 2)}. The graph
diameter is 3. Hence the second request (6,2) cannot use a path 6→5→4→3→2
because the length of this path is more than the diameter. The resulting assignment by the method in [3] is as follows. The request (1,2) uses path 1→2 and
wavelength λ = 1. The request (6,2) uses path 6→1→2 and wavelength λ = 2.
However, only one wavelength can be enough if all edge disjoint paths are used.
Fig. 2 shows a strategic comparison between the conventional approach and
the proposed one. The conventional approach is done by selecting routes for
the set of connection requests. This will be repeated for the subsequent sets of
requests. However the proposed approach ﬁnds maximum number of EDPs for all
possible connections and stores them in a lookup table for lightpath assignments.

To solve the RWA problem based on the table, just refer to the table without
reselecting a route for the same connection request and assign a wavelength to
the route as far as the network topology does not change. The optical network
is a technology that is employed in core backbone networks. In general they
are not changed frequently with ﬁxed connection requests. Hence the proposed
algorithm can be eﬃcient in terms of time. If the same connection request occurs
concurrently the probability that the proposed algorithm minimizes the number
of wavelengths comparing to others is relatively high. In the simulation for the
number of wavelength used, we generate random graphs and random demand
sets. First we obtain a random graph for the physical topology by specifying
the number of nodes in the graph and the probability of an edge existence (Pe )
for any node pair. The demand set is also generated randomly by populating
the matrix with the number of same requests, which is less than or equal to
Nc , where the probability of the request is speciﬁed by Pl . After obtaining the
table and we assign a path for a request of the demand set in order. Table 1

In order to ﬁnd a set of edge disjoint paths for eﬀective wavelength assignment we solve the maximal ﬂow problem from s to t in G, where any edge is
undirected and all capacities are equal to one. Generally (si , ti ) and (sj , tj ) for
arbitrary i and j (i = j) are diﬀerent. Here we can get an optimal solution for
RWA for the traﬃc between any couple of nodes as above. If the union of these
solutions is acceptable, then the optimal common solution is found. Otherwise,

1142

H. Choo and V.V. Shakhov

some wavelengths assigned to edge common paths should be replaced by some
other wavelength assignments. We do not necessarily get the optimal solution by
this approach, furthermore the assignment is not trivial as in examples earlier,
when λi = λj , ∀i, j.
As a network topology is usually ﬁxed we oﬀer to calculate a set of edge
disjoint paths for all possible pairs in advance before investigation of the demand
set. For this purpose the procedure Get Table(G) has been implemented and
used in the our method. By P (s, t, i) denote the result of Get Table(G), here
s = 1, 2 . . . , n − 1; t = s + 1, s + 2, . . . , n; i = 1, 2, . . . , Card(s, t). Entire edge
disjoint paths and their maximal quantity between nodes s and t can be found
from the solution of maximal unit ﬂow in G from s to t. Here the unit ﬂow
corresponds to one path. As we know, a straightforward implementation of the
maximal unit ﬂow algorithm runs in time O(|E| · Card(s, t)).
The network topology can be altered due to link-host failures and network expansions. In this situation, we reconﬁgure the set of edge disjoint paths P (s, t, i)
and continue the RWA process. Now we provide the description of the method.

end while.
Usually network problems can be classiﬁed into two parts. The ﬁrst part takes a
serious view of path, and the other for taking a serious view of ﬂow. Representative instance of the former is shortest path problem and the latter is source
and destination pair. The mechanism that searches the maximum ﬂow is based
on the famous Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. The two sets of elements divided by
an edge cut set are S and T, edge cut set is e1 , . . . , eCard(s,t) . Get Table(G)
obtains maximum possible edge disjoint paths for each (s, t) pair based on the
mechanism discussed above.
In Fig. 3 shows the graph of a network topology. And demand set is {(1,8),
(4,6), (1,8), (6,9)}. So the reasonable value d is 4.1. First we make the Table
through Get Table(G). For each demand pair, we obtain the maximum number of EDPs. The demand pair (1,8) which is requested at ﬁrst and third has

1→2→7→6→8 and 1→4→3→5→8. The second pair (4,6) has 4→6, 4→2→7→6,
and 4→3→5→6. And the last demand (6,9) has 6→8→9 and 6→5→9. We select
one at random 1→2→7→6→8. For the second pair (4,6), assign the shortest EDP
in the Table 4→6. And for the third one (1,8), we take the path 1→4→3→5→8
because the other one is used for the ﬁrst demand (1,8). At the last demand
(6,9), assign the path 6→5→9 since edge (6,8) is used for the ﬁrst demand. The
total number of wavelengths used is 1. We need 2 wavelengths for BGA for EDP
based algorithm in this topology, i.e. 1→4→6→8 and 4→3→5→6 for wavelength
1, and 1→4→6→8 and 6→5→9 for wavelength 2.

Performance Evaluation

We now describe some numerical results with which we compare the performance of the proposed scheme, the LTB RWA algorithm [4], and the BGA for
EDP based Greedy EDP RWA described in [3]. We compare the number of wavelengths used and the running time. We use NSFNET for the running time as
done earlier and random graphs for the number of wavelengths used to test them
in various network topologies. The demand set is also generated randomly by
populating the n × n matrix with the number of requests, which is less than or
equal to Nc , where the probability of the request is speciﬁed by Pl . We simulate
1,000 times for each n, Pe , and Pl , and obtain the average number of wavelengths
used. Table 2 shows the number of wavelengths used for each combination of the
graph G and the demand set. Note that the proposed scheme (denoted as ‘New’
in the Table 2) consistently requires the number of wavelengths which is quite
similar to those of BGA for EDP based Greedy EDP RWA (denoted as ‘BGA’)
and LTB RWA (denoted as ‘LTB’).
We measure the running time for three algorithms on NSFNET with the
demand set as obtained earlier. We generate 100 to 1,000 demand sets separately
and take the average running time. Fig. 4 shows the average running time when
Pl = 0.6 and Nc = 5, and other Pl values present the similar trends. As a
result, the proposed scheme uses almost same number of wavelengths when the
multiplicity of a pair is close to 1, meanwhile it is better than other schemes
when the multiplicity becomes higher. Furthermore, the proposed scheme takes
signiﬁcantly less running time than others.

Conclusion

In this paper we present an RWA method in optical networks to minimize
the number of wavelengths needed with shorter running time than others. It
is studied in the static path assignment and without wavelength converters. The
method obtains the maximum edge disjoint paths for each and every possible
source-destination pair, and stores them in a table in advance. And for each demand pair of the demand set, we assign any available path from the table. The
table obtained is again directly used for other demand sets unless the network

topology changes. The comprehensive computer simulation results show that our
scheme uses almost same number of wavelengths when the multiplicity of a pair
is close to 1, meanwhile it is much better than others when the multiplicity becomes higher. Furthermore, the proposed scheme takes signiﬁcantly less running
time than others.
