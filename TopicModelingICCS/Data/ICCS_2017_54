Spadon et al.

Considering that different crime types are related by being close to each other [7], we intend
to identify how they behave in various scenarios of criminality spread. Accordingly, our proposal
provides knowledge about criminality in the context of urban structures, working on issues
related to: (A) the identification of criminal areas; (B) the analysis of the homogeneity of
crimes’ distribution; (C) the identification of behaviors regarding crimes’ sparsity; and (D) the
description of synthetic cases in which the spread of crimes behaves differently.

Proposed Methodology

Our methodology is divided into four phases: Mapping of Urban Crimes; Criminal Community
Identification; Community Distribution Analysis; and Behavioral Analysis of Crime Propagation. Or dataset consists of an electronic map of San Francisco — CA1 and a list of 1,916,911
georeferenced criminal incidents from Jan 1st, 2003 to May 5th, 20162 . To validate our methodology, we employed Homogeneity (H) and Completeness (C) scores, derived from an entropybased cluster evaluation [8]. The early three phases have already been reported in Spadon et
al. [7], and, therefore, due to space limitations, we only detail the main contribution of this
paper, which focuses on the analyses of crime propagation in urban streets.
Crime Propagation Behavior Analysis. Crimes tend to be related to the dynamics of
the urban streets. These dynamics can be linked to the structural features of the network,
according to models of epidemic propagation. In this sense, we derived a model, based on
notions of epidemic propagation, to portray the crime dispersion in a city region. Such model
relies on basic principles of epidemic dynamics. According to Pastor-Satorras et al. [9], the
Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model is compartmentalized into two possible states
(susceptible and infected), thus allowing two possible transitions. The former represents the
interaction of a susceptible node with an infected one S → I, becoming infected as well. The
latter represents the opposite, when an infected node recovers and becomes susceptible I → S.
An epidemic is defined in a time interval that holds t steps. Such steps can be described in
any time unit, which will correspond to an iteration of a loop in an algorithm. Moreover, in a
given epidemic, N = S(t)+I(t) holds true for all values of t, where N is the number of nodes, S(t)
is the number of susceptible individuals, and I(t) is the number of infected nodes. Given this
I
notion, two deterministic equations can be derived. First, dP
dt = +(pPI )PS − qPI describes the
dPS
infected nodes per time, whereas dt = −(pPI )PS + qPI describes the susceptible nodes; where
Pc , c ∈ {I, S}, represents the percentage of nodes that are infected or susceptible, pPI is the
force of infection, and p and q are the infection and recovering probabilities, respectively.
Our model is based on the SIS model (see Algorithm 1) driven by the fact that human
actions are able to prevent crime events. It is a reinterpretation of the algebraic nuances of the
SIS model in the context of crime propagation. The spread of crimes across nodes indicates
that particular nodes are becoming more dangerous. The degree of danger in a region turns it
into a propitious spot for crimes; hence, criminal regions are being expanded.
The key assumption of our methodology is that if a crime occurs in a given spot (node)
and nothing is done to prevent new crimes in its surroundings, then criminality tends to raise
in neighboring nodes with a certain probability. Contrarily, when prevention policies are employed to counter crimes, the infection probability decreases with the distance from the initial
crime spot. That is, the georeferenced characteristic of the network interferes in the way that

criminality spreads. This implies that crimes are more intense in the surroundings of where
a real crime occurs, and are less intense or even nonexistent in farther regions. Shortly, our
model has the following assumptions: (I) crimes propagate more easily to closer nodes than to
farther ones; (II) the closer a newly-infected node is to a criminal node, the less likely it is to
recover; (III) human interference in the system changes the way that criminality propagates.
The proposed model relies on two node states: criminal (nodes with at least one crime) and
non-criminal (nodes with none) — for details of mapping and quantifying crimes as attributes of
complex networks see Spadon et al. [7]. The contagious process of our model occurs reactively.
An infected node propagates its criminality to all the nodes connected to it. In addition, one
node at a time can be recovered, whereas many susceptible nodes can be infected simultaneously.
An epidemic propagates from an infected node to the directly connected nodes according to
a probability p, whereas there is a probability q that an infected node will recover and become
susceptible again. Moreover, p + q = 1 holds true in every stage of the epidemic propagation.
Considering a system that satisfies this model, the nodes with registered crimes are the seeds;
that is, based on our dataset, they are the early disseminators of criminality. Accordingly, as
time goes by, the crimes that occurred in the seeds continuously impact the directly connected
nodes. For this reason, we assign to the seeds a high probability of infection, i.e. p = 0.5. We
rely on a high probability of infection for the seeds because the seeds have been acting as crime
spots over the years. Intuitively, the seeds have also a probability q = 0.5 of being recovered.
The probability of farther nodes becoming infected is influenced by their distance from the
seeds, i.e. the propagation is impacted by the network topology. Conversely, the epidemic tends
to lose its strength as it goes farther from a given criminal node. Such distance impacts the
infection probability p and is referred to as the infection loss l, 0 ≤ l ≤ 1, where 0 indicates no
loss and 1 indicates the opposite. Hence, when a susceptible node becomes infected, it inherits a
percentage pnew of the infection probability pold from its infector, defined as pnew = pold ×(1−l);
symmetrically, the new infected node acquires a higher probability of recovering, which is defined
as qnew = 1 − pnew . The value of l can be understood as the human interference; for instance,
when the police act in a crime region and, due to the effectiveness of its actions, the criminality
tends to propagate slower than in a system where there is no interference.
Based on this model and on complex network analysis techniques — data mapping, com3

munity detection, similarity assess, cluster-based behavioral analysis, our work presents how
to analyze the impact of the intervention on criminal spots, allowing to prevent epidemic outbreaks in criminal areas. We show how the crimes are impacted in different situations of human
intervention by measuring their score of Homogeneity along with their Completeness scores.

Results and Discussions

Our results start by labeling nodes into two categories, criminal and non-criminal. The criminal
nodes served as seeds, whereas non-criminal nodes were marked as susceptible. In this context,
we heuristically evaluated three specific scenarios. Each one has a different semantic perspective
that explains their criminality spread across the nodes (Section 2). The scenarios are described
as follows: (1) the first one outlines the chaos (l = 0.00), in which there is no interest in acting
against crimes; (2) the second one represents the desire to change (l = 0.25), in which there are
moderate efforts to revert the criminal scenario, but they are still not enough; (3) the third one
describes the decay of criminality (l = 0.50), which ensures peace to all subregions of a city and
also portrays a more effective crime prevention policy. For other values of l, the target scenario
should behave linearly regarding the aforementioned ones. We evaluated each scenario by means
of criminality propagation, adapting the SIS epidemic model. Such evaluations indicate that
by adopting crime prevention policies, the number of criminal and non-criminal nodes differ
considerably. The results are depicted in Figure 1 using p = 0.5.

Figure 1: Results from crime propagation using a model derived from the SIS epidemics model.
We show two cases where the values of p vary to depict how the model behaves. Each case is
evaluated by altering the constant that denotes human intervention in a city subregion.
In Scenario 1, it is possible to see an increase of criminality by crimes not being properly
prevented. Consequently, the number of criminal nodes, which is originally less than 10%
of all nodes, comes to be almost equal to the number of non-criminal ones in almost 20, 000
propagation steps. However, in Scenario 2, a decay in the criminality spread is seen, since the
number of criminal nodes does not increase as in the former scenario. In this case, they stay
lower than the non-criminal nodes, denoting a resistance to the spread. Besides, criminal nodes
represent about 20% of all nodes at the end of the simulation, which indicates that criminality
was contained compared to the previous scenario, but nonetheless human intervention was not
fully effective. Subsequently, in Scenario 3, the number of criminal nodes was unable to become
higher than the number of non-criminal ones. Instead, close to 9, 000 propagation steps, the
criminal nodes were powerless to further propagate criminality. Furthermore, they were capable
of recovering themselves, and thus the epidemic died out. Hence, the number of infected nodes
converged to zero, which denotes that the criminality was contained. At last, we evaluated how
intrinsic is the criminality in the studied region of the city using cluster evaluation measures.
Along these lines, in Scenario 1 (H = 0.00111; C = 0.00047), we have an outbreak case,
in which, considering the Homogeneity score, the criminality is scattered across all the studied
subregion, and it is common to see criminal and non-criminal nodes equally distributed. Also,

both node types are scattered and recurrent, represented by the Completeness score close to
zero. In Scenario 2 (H = 0.00665; C = 0.00266), the majority of nodes are non-criminal when
compared to Scenario 1, and the region is more unbalanced in terms of criminal and noncriminal nodes. This is a consequence of the human intervention in the system. Furthermore,
it is possible to see that the values for both scores contrast with the ones of the other scenarios
— the chaos of Scenario 1 and the peace of Scenario 3. This is evidence that criminality is
being changed due to a stronger human interference. Specifically, in Scenario 3 (H = 1.00000;
C = 0.00000), crimes were eradicated, represented by the Homogeneity equal to 1, indicating
that all communities have only non-criminal nodes. Also, Completeness equals to 0, pointing
out that only one of the classes has prevailed while the other has been eradicated. Hence,
Scenario 3 exhibits a behavior that tends to be opposite to the one seen in Scenario 1.
The results demonstrate that our methodology provides a view of the crime scenario of a
city, taking into account different degrees of human intervention in criminal activities of a given
city subregion. Therefore, it enables the analysis of crime outbreaks and the impact on criminal
regions by containing or disseminating criminality to the entire network.

Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a technique for assessing crime behavior in street networks considering
the perspective of the criminality spread. Our results are based on the analysis of real crime
data of the city of San Francisco — CA which was represented by means of complex networks
through electronic maps. Our results indicate that epidemic propagation models, allied to
network mapping techniques and community-related measures, can aid the characterization
of crime behavior and its dispersion across a city. Besides, criminal regions are the most
propitious to propagate criminal activity through the network as a whole, requiring a higher
human intervention. Lastly, as future work, we will expand our methodology by including time
series analyses in the context of crime behavior.
