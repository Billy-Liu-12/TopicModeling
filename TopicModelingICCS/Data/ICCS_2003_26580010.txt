Abstract. The fuzzy set is a powerful tool used to describe an uncertain
financial environment in which not only the financial markets but also
the financial managers’ decisions are subject to vagueness, ambiguity or
some other kind of fuzziness. Based on fuzzy decision theory, two portfolio rebalancing models with transaction costs are proposed. An example
is given to illustrate that the two linear programming models based on
fuzzy decisions can be used efficiently to solve portfolio rebalancing problems by using real data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange.

Introduction

In 1952, Markowitz [8] published his pioneering work which laid the foundation
of modern portfolio analysis. It combines probability theory and optimization
theory to model the behavior of economic agents under uncertainty. Konno and
Yamazika [5] used the absolute deviation risk function, to replace the risk function in Markowitz’s model thus formulated a mean absolute deviation portfolio
optimization model. It turns out that the mean absolute deviation model maintains the nice properties of Markowitz’s model and removes most of the principal
difficulties in solving Markowitz’s model.
Transaction cost is one of the main sources of concern to portfolio managers.
Arnott and Wagner [2] found that ignoring transaction costs would result in
an inefficient portfolio. Yoshimoto’s emperical analysis [12] also drew the same
conclusion. Due to changes of situation in financial markets and investors’ preferences towards risk, most of the applications of portfolio optimization involve
a revision of an existing portfolio, i.e., portfolio rebalancing.
Usually, expected return and risk are two fundamental factors which investors
consider. Sometimes, investors may consider other factors besides the expected

return and risk, such as liquidity. Liquidity has been measured as the degree of
probability involved in the conversion of an investment into cash without any
significant loss in value. Arenas, Bilbao and Rodriguez [1] took into account three
criteria: return, risk and liquidity and used a fuzzy goal programming approach
to solve the portfolio selection problem.
In 1970, Bellman and Zadeh [3] proposed the fuzzy decision theory. Ramaswamy [10] presented a portfolio selection method using the fuzzy decision
theory. A similar approach for portfolio selection using the fuzzy decision theory
¨
was proposed by Le´
on et al. [6]. Using the fuzzy decision principle, Ostermark
[9] proposed a dynamic portfolio management model by fuzzifying the objective
and the constraints. Watada [11] presented another type of portfolio selection
model using the fuzzy decision principle. The model is directly related to the
mean-variance model, where the goal rate (or the satisfaction degree) for an expected return and the corresponding risk are described by logistic membership
functions.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, a bi-objective linear programming model for portfolio rebalancing with transaction costs is proposed. In
Section 3, based on the fuzzy decision theory, two linear programming models
for portfolio rebalancing with transaction costs are proposed. In Section 4, an
example is given to illustrate that the two linear programming models based on
fuzzy decisions can be used efficiently to solve portfolio rebalancing problems by
using real data from the Shanghai Stock Exchange. A few concluding remarks
are finally given in Section 5.

Linear Programming Model for Portfolio Rebalancing

Due to changes of situation in financial markets and investors’ preferences towards risk, most of the applications of portfolio optimization involve a revision
of an existing portfolio. The transaction costs associated with purchasing a new
portfolio or rebalancing an existing portfolio have a significant effect on the investment strategy. Suppose an investor allocates his wealth among n securities
offering random rates of returns. The investor starts with an existing portfolio
and decides how to reconstruct a new portfolio.
The expected net return on the portfolio after paying transaction costs is
given by
n

j − xj ) −

Usually, the anticipation of certain levels of expected return and risk are two
fundamental factors which investors consider. Sometimes, investors may wish to
consider other factors besides expected return rate and risk, such as liquidity.
Liquidity has been measured as the degree of probability of being able to convert
an investment into cash without any significant loss in value. Generally, investors
prefer greater liquidity, especially since in a bull market for securities, returns
on securities with high liquidity tend to increase with time. The turnover rate
of a security is the proportion of turnover volumes to tradable volumes of the
security, and is a factor which may reflect the liquidity of the security. In this
paper, we assume that the turnover rates of securities are modelled by possibility
distributions rather than probability distributions.
Carlsson and Full´er [4] introduced the notation of crisp possibilistic mean
(expected) value and crisp possibilistic variance of continuous possibility distributions, which are consistent with the extension principle. Denote the turnover
rate of the security j by the trapezoidal fuzzy number ˆlj = (laj , lbj , αj , βj ). Then
n
ˆlj . By the definition,
the turnover rate of the portfolio x = (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) is
j=1

the crisp possibilistic mean (expected) value of the turnover rate of the portfolio
x = (x1 , x2 , · · · , xn ) can be represented as
E(ˆl(x)) = E(

ˆlj xj ) =

Assume that the investor does not invest the additional capital during the portfolio rebalancing process. We use w(x) to measure the risk of the portfolio and
use the crisp possibilistic mean (expected) value of the turnover rate to measure
the liquidity of the portfolio. Assume the investor wants to maximize return on
and minimize the risk to the portfolio after paying transaction costs. At the same
time, he requires that the liquidity of the portfolio is not less than a given constant through rebalancing the existing portfolio. Based on the above discussions,
the portfolio rebalancing problem is formulated as follows:

Portfolio Rebalancing Models Based on Fuzzy Decision

In the portfolio rebalancing model proposed in above section, the return, the risk
and the liquidity of the portfolio are considered. However, investor’s satisfactory
degree is not considered. In financial management, the knowledge and experience
of an expert are very important in decision-making. Through comparing the
present problem with their past experience and evaluating the whole portfolio
in terms of risk and liquidity in the decision-making process, the experts may
estimate the objective values concerning the expected return, the risk and the

14

liquidity. Based on experts’ knowledge, the investor may decide his levels of
aspiration for the expected return, the risk and the liquidity of the portfolio.
3.1

Portfolio Rebalancing Model with Linear Membership Function

During the portfolio rebalancing process, an investor considers three factors (the
expected return, the risk and the liquidity of the portfolio). Each of the factors
is transformed using a membership function so as to characterize the aspiration
level. In this section, the three factors are considered as the fuzzy numbers with
linear membership function.
a) Membership function for the expected return on the portfolio

if E(r(x)) < r0
 0
0
µr (x) = E(r(x))−r
if r0 ≤ E(r(x)) ≤ r1
 r1 −r0
1
if E(r(x)) > r1
where r0 represents the necessity aspiration level for the expected return on the
portfolio, r1 represents the sufficient aspiration level for the expected return of
the portfolio.
b) Membership function for the risk of the portfolio

if w(x) < w0
 1
µw (x) = ww11−w(x)
−w0 if w0 ≤ w(x) ≤ w1

0
if w(x) > w1
where w0 represents the necessity aspiration level for the risk of the portfolio,
w1 represents the sufficient aspiration level for the risk of the portfolio.
c) Membership
function for the liquidity of the portfolio


if E(ˆl(x)) < l0
 0
E(ˆ
l(x))−l0
µˆl (x) =
if l0 ≤ E(ˆl(x)) ≤ l1
l −l

 1 0
1
if E(ˆl(x)) > l1
where l0 represents the necessity aspiration level for the liquidity of the portfolio,
l1 represents the sufficient aspiration level for the liquidity of the portfolio.
The values of r0 , r1 , w0 , w1 , l0 and l1 can be given by the investor based on
the experts’ knowledge or past experience. According to Bellman and Zadeh’s
maximization principle, we can define λ = min{µr (x), µw (x), µˆl (x)}.
The fuzzy portfolio rebalancing problem can be formulated as follows:

The above problem is a standard linear programming problem. One can use
several algorithms of linear programming to solve it efficiently, for example, the
simplex method.
3.2

Portfolio Rebalancing Model with Non-linear Membership
Function

Watada [11] employed a logistic function for a non-linear membership function
1
f (x) = 1+exp(−α)
. We can find that a trapezoidal membership function is an
approximation from a logistic function. Therefore, the logistic function is considered much more appropriate to denote a vague goal level, which an investor
considers.
Membership functions µr (x), µw (x) and µˆl (x) for the expected return, the
risk and the liquidity on the portfolio are represented respectively as follows:
µr (x) =

1
,
1 + exp(−αr (E(r(x)) − rM ))

(5)

1
,
1 + exp(αw (w(x) − wM ))

(6)

µw (x) =
µˆl (x) =

1

1 + exp(−αl (E(ˆl(x)) − lM ))

(7)

where αr , αw and αl can be given respectively by the investor based on his own
degree of satisfaction for the expected return, the level of risk and the liquidity.
rM , wM and lM represent the middle aspiration levels for the expected return,

16

the level of risk and the liquidity of the portfolio respectively. The value of rM ,
wM and lM can be gotten approximately by the values of r0 , r1 , w0 , w1 , l0 and
w0 +w1
1
1
and lM = l0 +l
l1 , i.e. rM = r0 +r
2 , wM =
2
2 .
Remark: αr , αw and αl determine respectively the shapes of membership functions µr (x), µw (x) and µˆl (x) respectively, where αr > 0, αw > 0 and αl > 0. The
larger parameters αr , αw and αl get, the less their vagueness becomes.
The

where αr , αw and αl are parameters which can be given by the investor based
on his own degree of satisfaction regarding the three factors.
The above problem is also a standard linear programming problem. One can
use several algorithms of linear programming to solve it efficiently, for example,
the simplex method.
Remark: The non-linear membership functions of the three factors may change
their shape according to the parameters αr , αw and αl . Through selecting the
values of these parameters, the aspiration levels of the three factors may be described accurately. On the other hand, deferent parameter values may reflect

deferent investors’ aspiration levels. Therefore, it is convenient for deferent investors to formulate investment strategies using the above portfolio rebalancing
model with non-linear membership functions.

An Example

In this section, we give an example to illustrate the models for portfolio rebalancing based on fuzzy decision as proposed in this paper. We suppose that an
investor wants to choose thirty different types of stocks from the Shanghai Stock
Exchange for his investment.
The rate of transaction costs for stocks is 0.0055 in the two securities markets
on the Chinese mainland. Assume that the investor has already owned an existing portfolio and he will not invest the additional capital during the portfolio
rebalancing process. The proportions of the stocks are listed in Table 1.
Table 1. The proportions of stocks in the existing portfolio

7
Proportions 0.05 0.08 0.05 0.35 0.10 0.12 0.25

Suddenly, the financial market situation changes, and the investor needs to
change his investment strategy. In the example, we assume that the upper bound
of the proportions of Stock j owned by the investor is 1. Now we use the fuzzy
portfolio rebalancing models in this paper to re-allocate his assets. At first, we
collect historical data of the thirty kinds of stocks from January, 1999 to January,
2002. The data are downloaded from the website www.stockstar.com. Then we
use one month as a period to get the historical rates of returns of thirty-six
periods. Using historical data of the turnover rates of the securities, we can
estimate the turnover rates of the securities as the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers.
In the following, we will give two kinds computational results according to
whether the investor has a conservative or an aggressive approach.
At first, we assume that the investor has a conservative and pessimistic mind.
Then the values of r0 , r1 , l0 , l1 , w0 , and w1 which are given by the investor may
be small. They are as follows: r0 = 0.028, r1 = 0.030, l0 = 0.020, l1 = 0.025,
w0 = 0.025 and w1 = 0.035.
Considering the three factors (the return, the risk and liquidity) as fuzzy
numbers with trapezoidal membership function, we get a portfolio rebalancing
strategy by solving (P4). The membership grade λ, the obtained risk, the obtained return and obtained liquidity are listed in Table 2.
Table 2. Membership grade λ, obtained risk, obtained return and obtained liquidity
when r0 = 0.028, r1 = 0.030, l0 = 0.020, l1 = 0.025, w0 = 0.025 and w1 = 0.035.

In the example, we give three deferent values of parameters αr , αw and αl .
The membership grade η, the obtained risk, the obtained return and obtained
liquidity are listed in Table 3.

Secondly, we assume that the investor has an aggressive and optimistic mind.
Then the values of r0 , r1 , l0 , l1 , w0 , and w1 which are given by the investor are
big. They are as follows: r0 = 0.028, r1 = 0.036, l0 = 0.021, l1 = 0.031, w0 = 0.032
and w1 = 0.036.
Considering the three factors (the return, the risk and liquidity) as fuzzy
numbers with trapezoidal membership function, we get a portfolio rebalancing
strategy by solving (P4). The membership grade λ, the obtained risk, the obtained return and obtained liquidity are listed in Table 4.

From the above results, we can find that we get the different portfolio rebalancing strategies by solving (P6) in which the different values of the parameters
( αr , αw and αl ) are given. Through choosing the values of the parameters
αr , αw and αl according to the investor’s frame of mind, the investor may get
a favorite portfolio rebalancing strategy. The portfolio rebanlancing model with
the non-linear membership function is much more convenient than the one with
the linear membership function.

Conclusion

Considering the expected return, the risk and liquidity, a linear programming
model for portfolio rebalancing with transaction costs is proposed. Based on
fuzzy decision theory, two fuzzy portfolio rebalancing models with transaction
costs are proposed. An example is given to illustrate that the two linear programming models based on fuzzy decision-making can be used efficiently to
solve portfolio rebalancing problems by using real data from the Shanghai Stock
Exchange. The computation results show that the portfolio rebanlancing model
with the non-linear membership function is much more convenient than the one
with the linear membership function. The portfolio rebalaning model with nonlinear membership function can generate a favorite portfolio rebalancing strategy
according to the investor’s satisfactory degree.
