Abstract. In this paper, we develop an eﬃcient characteristic ﬁnite
element method (FEM) for solving the magnetic induction equation in
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We carry out numerical experiments
on a two dimensional test case to investigate the inﬂuence of resistivity
at diﬀerent scales. In particular, our numerical results exhibit how the
topological structure and energy of the magnetic ﬁeld evolve for diﬀerent
scales of resistivity. Magnetic reconnection can also be observed in the
numerical experiments.
Keywords: characteristic method, convection-diﬀusion, magnetohydrodynamics(MHD), magnetic resistivity, numerical simulation.

Introduction

Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) is the study of the interaction between the magnetic ﬁeld and the ﬂow of electrically conducting ﬂuids, typically plasmas, liquid
metals, or brine. The MHD equations are a combination of the Navier-Stokes
equations for ﬂuid motion and the Maxwell equations for electromagnetism coupled through Lorentz body force and Ohmic heating [2,3]:
∂t ρ + ∇ · (ρv) = 0 (Mass conservation)
∂t (ρv) + ∇ · (ρv ⊗ v − B ⊗ B) + ∇p∗ = 0 (Momentum conservation)
∂t E + ∇ · (E + p∗ )v − (v · B)B = ε|∇ × B|2 (Energy conservation)
∂t B = ∇ × (v × B) + εΔB (Magnetic induction equation)
∇ · B = 0,

for all t ≥ 0 (Solenoidal property)

where ρ is the mass density (per unit volume of the liquid), m = ρv the momentum density, v the velocity ﬁeld, B the magnetic ﬁeld, E the total energy
density, ε the magnetic resistivity that represents the eﬀect of Ohmic heating, t
the time variable, and ⊗ stands for the tensor product.

Some estimates suggest that up to 99% of the entire universe is ﬁlled by
plasmas [2]. Man-made and natural plasmas can be found in plasma TVs, plasma
lamps, lightning, aurora, and solar winds (plasmas ﬂowing out from the Sun at a
very high speed and in the radially outward direction). Table 1 lists the resistivity
of various types of plasmas. Among them, the 5k eV plasma is used in large lab
fusion experiments [2].

The simplest MHD is the ideal MHD model that assumes the ﬂuid has no
resistivity and can be treated as a perfect conductor. The ideal MHD equations can be reformulated as a hyperbolic system and then hyperbolic solvers
apply. If the resistivity terms are retained, the model is referred as resistive
MHD.
Ideal MHD is applicable for a limited time before resistivity becomes too
important to ignore. This limited time span varies. It could be hundreds to
thousands of years for the Sun, and hence much longer than the actual lifetime
of a sunspot, so it is reasonable to ignore the resistivity. However, a meter-sized
volume of seawater has a magnetic diﬀusion time measured in milliseconds. Instabilities existing in a plasma can increase its eﬀective resistivity. The enhanced
resistivity usually results from the formation of small scale structures such as
current sheets or ﬁne scale magnetic turbulence. In these situations, the ideal
MHD model is broken. When resistivity is present, magnetic reconnection may
happen, in which a plasma releases stored magnetic energy as waves, bulk mechanical acceleration of material, particle acceleration, or heat. In addition, most
numerical methods for ideal MHD inevitably introduce numerical diﬀusion and
ﬁnally break down. Therefore, eﬃcient numerical methods for resistive MHD are
much needed.
However, resistive MHD presents a challenge due to the widespread time
scales, the nonlinear coupling, the ﬁneness of spatial grids for resolving current sheets, etc. To tackle this multi-physics and multi-scale problem, one could
adopt an operator decomposition approach. Eﬃcient solvers based on characteristic tracking for MHD kinematics (the inﬂuence of the velocity ﬁeld on the
magnetic ﬁeld) and the ﬂuid equations (the ﬁrst three equations in (1) can be
solved as a hyperbolic system) are developed respectively. Strategies for controlling errors of coupling between the characteristic solvers and the hyperbolic
solvers (reﬂection of the interaction of ﬂuid motion and electromagnetism) are
also to be investigated.

A Characteristic Finite Element Method for the
Magnetic Field Induction Equation

The magnetic induction equation and the solenoidal (divergence-free) property
together describe the kinematics of MHD ﬂows, i.e., the inﬂuence of the velocity
ﬁeld on the magnetic ﬁeld. The divergence-free property ∇ · B = 0 should be
preserved by numerical methods, globally or locally, in the classical or weak
sense. One approach is to express the magnetic ﬁeld as the curl of a vector
potential A, i.e., to deﬁne B = ∇×A. This approach is particularly convenient in
two dimensions, where A = (0, 0, A3 ) and B = (B1 , B2 , 0) = (∂y A3 , −∂x A3 , 0).
If the ﬂuid is incompressible (∇·v = 0), then the magnetic ﬁeld equation reduces
to a scalar convection-diﬀusion equation about the magnetic potential A3 :
∂t A3 + ∇ · (vA3 − ε∇A3 ) = 0.

(2)

Convection-diﬀusion problems like equation (2) arise also in groundwater contaminant remediation, petroleum reservoir simulation, and many other applications. A general form for this type of problems is
⎧
ut + ∇ · (vu − D∇u) = f (x, t), x ∈ Ω, t ∈ (0, T ],

where Ω ⊂ Rd (d = 1, 2, 3) is a domain with boundary Γ = ∂Ω, u(x, t) is the
unknown function, v(x, t) a prescribed velocity ﬁeld, D(x, t) a diﬀusion matrix,
and f (x, t) a source/sink term. Let n be the unit outward normal vector on Γ .
We deﬁne the inﬂow, outﬂow, and noﬂow boundaries Γ I , Γ O , Γ N as
Γ I = {x ∈ Γ : v·n < 0},

Γ O = {x ∈ Γ : v·n > 0},

Γ N = {x ∈ Γ, v·n = 0}.

Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin boundary conditions are posed as
u(x, t) = g1type (x, t), (x, t) ∈ Γ type (Dirichlet),
−D∇u(x, t) · n = g2type (x, t), (x, t) ∈ Γ type (Neumann),

where type = I, O, N represents an inﬂow, outﬂow, or noﬂow boundary type.
Solutions to convection-dominated (|v|
|D|) convection-diﬀusion problems
exhibit physical features such as steep ﬂuid fronts, current sheets, and shocks,
which pose serious challenges to numerical methods for these problems. Standard ﬁnite diﬀerence or ﬁnite element methods produce either excessive nonphysical oscillations or extra numerical diﬀusion, which smears these physical
features. The Eulerian-Lagrangian method developed in [5] (see also the references therein) is a characteristic FEM for these problems. This method naturally
incorporates all types of boundary conditions in its formulation, is not subject

to the severe restrictions imposed by the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, and generates accurate numerical solutions even if large time steps are
used. We brieﬂy review this method in this section.
Let 0 = t0 < t1 < · · · < tn−1 < tn < · · · < tN = T be a partition of [0, T ]
with Δtn = tn − tn−1 . We multiply equation (3) by a test function w(x, t) that
vanishes outside the space-time strip Ω × (tn−1 , tn ] and is discontinuous in time
at time tn−1 . Integration by parts leads to the following weak form

Characteristic tracking is also an important part of the method. One solves
the following initial value problem by numerical methods, e.g., the 2nd order
Runge-Kutta method, since an exact solution is usually unavailable.

Let ΓnI be the restriction of Γ I on [tn−1 , tn ] and similarly for ΓnO . Variable
time steps ΔtI (x, tn ), ΔtO (y, t) are deﬁned according to backward tracking [5].

Numerical Experiments on the Resistivity Scales

In this section, we perform numerical experiments on a test case that simulates
the role of the magnetic ﬁeld in a convecting plasma. The example was originally
proposed in [7] and recently studied in [8]. In this paper, the Eulerian-Lagrangian
method discussed in the previous section is used as a uniﬁed numerical method
for the two dimensional magnetic potential equation (2). By “uniﬁed”, we mean
that the solver can be applied to the equation with or without the resistivity
term. Lagrangian P1 elements are used on a 128 × 128 × 2 structured triangular
mesh (a rectangle is divided into two triangles). The second order Gaussian
quadrature is employed for all triangle elements. The solver uses a large time
step Δt = 0.1. The 2nd order Runge-Kutta method with 16 micro steps is used
for tracking characteristics. We test the example with four diﬀerent values for
resistivity (ε = 0, 5 × 10−7 , 5 × 10−5 , 2 × 10−2 ) and observe the changes in the
magnetic ﬁeld energy and topology.
The spatial domain is Ω = [−0.5, 0.5]2. The velocity ﬁeld is prescribed as
v(x, y) = (− sin(2πx) cos(2πy), cos(2πx) sin(2πy)) .
All four sides of the domain are noﬂow boundaries. The boundary conditions are

This model problem exhibits diﬀerent scales of resistivity. The convection
and diﬀusion processes behave at disparate scales. But the characteristic FEM
discussed in Section 2 is an eﬃcient solver for this type of problems. Accordingly,
there are two time scales in the numerical simulation. The macro time step for
the numerical scheme (8) is related to diﬀusion and could be relatively large.
It is not subject to the CFL condition. But the convection happens at a much
faster pace. Small micro time steps are used for solving equations (6) and (7),
so that steep ﬂuid fronts can be accurately resolved.

Note that contours of the magnetic potential are actually magnetic ﬁeld lines.
When resistivity disappears, the magnetic equation becomes a pure convection
equation, the magnetic ﬁeld is “frozen”, In other words, a thin rope-like volume
of ﬂuid surrounding a magnetic ﬁeld line will continue to lie along the line, even
though it might be twisted and distorted [2]. The topology of the magnetic ﬁeld
does not change. However, the geometry of the magnetic ﬁeld changes due to the
convection, and as a result, the magnetic energy increase. This can be observed
in the left subplot of Figure 3. It is also known from Figure 2(a) that all magnetic
ﬁeld lines are conﬁned to each of the four convection cells.

When resistivity is present, the magnetic ﬁeld diﬀuses through the ﬂuid in
a manner similar to the diﬀusion of heat through a solid. The change of the
magnetic ﬂux on a closed curve due to the resistivity can produce a nonzero
component in the electric ﬁeld that is parallel to the magnetic ﬁeld, but this
does not imply magnetic reconnection will necessarily happen [2]. As shown in
Figure 2, a resistivity of ε = 2 × 10−2 is too strong, no magnetic reconnection can happen. However, for ε = 5 × 10−5 , magnetic reconnection happens
around T = 3. Magnetic ﬁeld lines from diﬀerent magnetic domains are spliced
to one another, changing the overall topology of the magnetic ﬁeld. An X-type
conjunction can be observed in Figure 2(c).
In real plasma physics, an X-type neutral line is believed to form between
the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and a solar wind [1]. The evolution of the coronal
magnetic ﬁeld due to magnetic reconnection was investigated in [6].
Figure 3 shows the magnetic ﬁeld energy evolution for all four cases. For
ε = 2 × 10−2 , the strong resistivity quickly brings the magnetic ﬁeld to its
steady state. For ε = 5 × 10−5 , the time period for the magnetic ﬁeld to reach
its equilibrium is relatively longer. In general, this is related to the Alfv´en time
scale of a plasma [2]. All four cases exhibit an energy spike in the early stage, due
to the energy infusion from the initial convection-dominance. Table 2 lists the
maximal strength of the magnetic ﬁelds at several time moments. These results
are consistent with those about energy evolution.

Concluding Remarks

Other examples on applying the characteristic FEM to resolve the kinematics
of 2-dim resistive MHD ﬂows can be found in [4], which contains also a comparison of the numerical solutions of the time-dependent convection-diﬀusion
equation for magnetic induction and the steady-state convection-diﬀusion equation describing the equilibrium of a magnetic ﬁeld. While [4] examines the role
of velocity ﬁelds, this paper focuses on the role of the scale of resistivity.
The divergence-free property is an important physical property that should be
respected by numerical methods. Another approach is to use locally divergencefree (LDF) ﬁnite elements, especially for the three dimensional magnetic induction equation. Combining LDF ﬁnite elements and the discontinuous Galerkin
method to solve the ideal MHD equations has been reported in [3]. We are developing numerical methods for the resistive magnetic induction equation based
on combination of characteristic tracking and discontinuous or nonconforming
LDF ﬁnite elements. The results will be reported elsewhere.
This paper focuses on the role of resistivity in the kinematics of MHD, This is a
one-way coupling. But MHD is a coupled system about the interaction between
ﬂuid motion and electromagnetism. Numerical methods for the fully coupled
problems in resistive MHD are the topics of our ongoing research projects.
