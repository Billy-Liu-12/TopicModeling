Abstract
Those empirical properties exhibited by high frequency ﬁnancial data, such as time-varying
intensities and self-exciting features, make it a challenge to model appropriately the dynamics
associated with, for instance, order arrival. To capture the microscopic structures pertaining to
limit order books, this paper focuses on modeling high frequency ﬁnancial data using Hawkes
processes. Speciﬁcally, the model with power-law kernels is compared with the counterpart with
exponential kernels, on the goodness of ﬁt to the empirical data, based on a number of proposed
quantities for statistical tests. Based on one-trading-day data of one representative stock, it
is shown that Hawkes processes with power-law kernels are able to reproduce the intensity of
jumps in the price processes more accurately, which suggests that they could serve as a realistic
model for high frequency data on the level of microstructure.
Keywords: High frequency data, Hawkes processes, intensity kernel

Introduction

The prices of ﬁnancial assets are driven by the interaction of buy and sell orders. Today more
and more equity exchanges have been organized as order-driven markets, where the orders are
aggregated in a limit order book, which is available to market participants. At a given time the
limit order book states the quantities of the underlying asset that are posted at each price level.
The limit order book can be seen as a complex data generating process and modern information
technology allows traders in equity markets to process information, including order submissions
and cancelations, at high frequency and high speed. The traders/ﬁrms who utilize the new
technology for intraday trading for their own accounts are generally called high frequency
traders (HFTs), who are now major players in equity markets (Boehmer et al., 2013; Brogaard
et al., 2013; Hagstr¨omer and Norden, 2013; Hendershott and Riordan, 2011; Hendershott et al.,
2011; Jovanovic and Menkveld, 2011; Kirilenko et al., 2011; Menkveld, 2011).
In an order-driven market, the price dynamics of a ﬁnancial asset is the result of the dynamics
of the limit order book. HFTs try to model the dynamics, using more or less sophistical

techniques, conditioning on information about the history and the current state of the order
book, to make predictions concerning its short-term behavior as well as the direction of price
moves. Fundamentally, models of order book dynamics provide insights into the interplay
between order ﬂow and price evolution (Bouchaud et al., 2002; Doyne Farmer et al., 2004;
Foucault et al., 2005). Among the growing literature on modeling the dynamics of order books,
are equilibrium models (Foucault, 1999; Parlour, 1998), dynamic expected utility maximization
models (Parlour, 1998; Rosu, 2009), and models based on queuing system or self-exciting point
processes (A¨ıt-Sahalia et al., 2011; Bauwens and Hautsch, 2009; Cont et al., 2010).
Due to the complexity involved in the underlying dynamics, most of the aforementioned
models have diﬃculties in describing reasonably precisely the order book dynamics and hence
the price dynamics of the ﬁnancial asset. It is a challenge to formulate statistically realistic
and quantitatively feasible models for the dynamics of limit order books. In particular, on the
one hand, statistical features of order book dynamics, which are revealed by empirical studies
concerning properties of limit order books, are usually unrealistic to be represented in a single
model (Bouchaud et al., 2002; Doyne Farmer et al., 2004; Holliﬁeld et al., 2004). On the other
hand, a signiﬁcant number of existing stochastic models assume steady-state distributions,
which are not necessarily veriﬁed by real high frequency data (Bouchaud et al., 2009; Cont
et al., 2010; Luckock, 2003; Maslov and Mills, 2001; Smith et al., 2003).
Speciﬁcally, from a statistical perspective, modeling high-frequency data is challenging due
to the presence of strong autocorrelations in the order ﬂow, time-varying intensities of events,
and cross-correlations between the arrival rates of diﬀerent types of orders and potentially
between diﬀerent markets. These features can not be captured by standard Poisson point
processes. Meanwhile, Hawkes processes possess ﬂexible statistical properties allowing to incorporate autocorrelations and self-exciting features. Unlike time-series models such as ACDGARCH, they remain analytically tractable. Likelihood functions, conditional distributions,
moments, Laplace transforms, and characteristic functions may be computed analytically or
by solving ODEs. Due to their mathematical tractability and ability to account for clustering
eﬀects, since their introduction (Hawkes, 1971; Vere-Jones, 1970), they have been widely applied in, for instance, seismology (Ogata, 1999; Zhuang et al., 2002), shot noises (Br´emaud and
Massouli´e, 2002), biology (Coleman and Gastwirth, 1969; Reynaud-Bouret and Schbath, 2010),
criminology (Mohler et al., 2011). In ﬁnance, Hawkes processes are used in estimating VaR and
valuing credit derivatives (Chavez-Demoulin et al., 2005; Embrechts et al., 2011; Errais et al.,
2010; Giesecke et al., 2011), and in modeling market event data, microstructure noise, and clusters of extremes (Abergel and Jedidi, 2011; Bacry et al., 2013; Bacry and Muzy, 2014; Bauwens
and Hautsch, 2009; Bormetti et al., 2013; Bowsher, 2007; Chavez-Demoulin and McGill, 2012;
Cont, 2011; Filimonov and Sornette, 2012; Filimonov et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2014).
Hawkes processes with distinguishable kernels exhibit diﬀerent behaviors. In the literature,
more studies have been on Hawkes processes with exponential kernels (Hawkes, 1971; Ogata,
1981; Ozaki, 1979). This paper focuses on modeling high frequency data using Hawkes processes,
in particular, with power-law kernels, and studying the diﬀerence between power-law kernels
and exponential kernels. In Section 2, models based on Hawkes processes are brieﬂy discussed.
Empirical results on high frequency data are then reported in Section 3. Section 4 outlines
directions for possible future work.

Hawkes-Based Models

Consider an asset traded in a single market. Assume that each jump time the price moves by 1
tick only. Then it can be modeled using a Hawkes process (Bacry et al., 2013). Let P0 be the

price at time 0. The model for the price at time t is
Pt = P0 + Nt1 − Nt2 ,

(1)

where Nt1 is the number of upward jumps in the price and Nt2 is that of downward jumps
between 0 and t. The jump processes Nt1 and Nt2 are assumed to have intensities λ1t and λ2t ,
respectively, with

The model deﬁned in (3) results in a bivariate Hawkes process with exponential kernels and
that in (4) results in a bivariate Hawkes process with power law kernels. The model based on
the latter is the focus of this paper and in Section 3 it is demonstrated to capture the dynamics
of a limit order book more accurately than the counterpart based on the former.

Empirical Study

The two models (3) and (4) are implemented in MATLAB. For eﬃciency in estimating the
parameters, it is ﬁrst assumed that μ1 = μ2 , α11 = α22 , α12 = α21 , β 11 = β 22 , β 12 = β 21 ,
and γ 11 = γ 12 = γ 21 = γ 22 , respectively in both models. Since the focus is on comparison
between the two types of kernels, the underlying price process does not aﬀect the result and the
study is based on the best bid of ERICB (Ericsson Telephone Company) on the trading day of
September 7th, 2012. For comparison, the same price process (1) needs to be assumed, where
P = {Pt }t≥0 denote the best bid, N 1 = {Nt1 }t≥0 the number of upward jumps with intensity
λ1 , and N 2 = {Nt2 }t≥0 the number of downward jumps with intensity λ2 .
As a starting point, to verify the assumption that the price moves by at most one tick at
each instance, the jump sizes on ﬁve exchanges are examined. As shown in Table 1, overall
7272
= 0.9758) of all jumps in the best bid was 1 tick only on September
more than 97% ( 7452
7th, 2012. On the two exchanges BOOK (Nasdaq OMX Stockholm) and CHIX (Chi-X), the
1719
corresponding numbers are 97% ( 1295
1330 = 0.9737) and 98% ( 1742 = 0.9868), respectively. Hence,
it is reasonable to ﬁrst make the assumption that the best bid moves by 1 tick for each jump.
To compare the goodness of ﬁt of the two models with the real data, a number of measures
are introduced ﬁrst.
Let N 1 denote the number of upward jumps, N 2 the number downward jumps, Pmax the
maximum price observed, and Pmin the minimum price observed, of the price evolution path Pt

The sample means of both measures of the model with power-law kernels are less than the
counterparts of the model with exponential kernels. This indicates that the model with powerlaw kernels is more stable in capturing the price movement and that on average the simulated
paths diverge from the original price evolution path less than the one with exponential kernels.

explanation of this is that the two models result in diﬀerent numbers of jumps of the simulated

From the statistical studies, it can thus be inferred that overall the model with power-law
kernels ﬁts the real data better than the one with exponential kernels.

Conclusion

Hawkes processes with power-law kernels are studied and compared with Hawkes processes with
exponential kernels for modeling high frequency data. It is veriﬁed by numerical results that
the former ﬁts real data better than the latter, which suggests that a Hawkes-based model with
power-law kernels be an appropriate choice for high frequency data.
The results obtained in this paper are based on the data of one stock on one trading day. An
immediate extension is then, for robustness study, to generalize the results on data of one stock
on multiple trading days and data of multiple stocks on one trading day. It is also interesting
to look into the computational eﬃciencies of diﬀerent algorithms to search for the maximum
likelihood estimator.
The study focuses on models for one stock with jumps of 1 tick at most on one exchange.
There are several possible extensions, including the cases that one stock in diﬀerent time intervals, diﬀerent stocks in the same time interval, and one stock on diﬀerent markets. For
example, it has been observed that the intensities of jumps in diﬀerent time intervals follow
diﬀerent patterns, which indicates that it is worth considering dividing a whole trading day into
sub-intervals and modeling them separately.
In reality, the price may move by more than 1 tick, as shown in Table 1. Suppose the price
of an asset moves up to d ticks for a jump, then the price can be described as a multivariate
Hawkes model,

where P0 is the price at time 0, N i,1 is the number of upward jumps with i ticks, and N i,2 is
that of downward jumps with i ticks between 0 and t, i = 1, . . . , d. The intensities of N i,1 and

It has been widely recognized that the price evolution of a stock is heavily aﬀected by large
