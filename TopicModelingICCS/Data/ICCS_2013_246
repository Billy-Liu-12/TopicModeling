Abstract
The M06 family of density functionals has been assessed for the calculation of the molecular structure and properties of the Rhodamine B molecule. The chemical reactivity descriptors have been calculated through Conceptual
DFT. The active sites for nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks have been chosen by relating them to the Fukui function indices and the dual descriptor f (2) (r). A comparison between the descriptors calculated through vertical energy
values and those arising from the Koopmans’ theorem approximation have been performed in order to check for the
validity of the last procedure.

1. Introduction
Rhodamine B (C28H3N2O3Cl; mol. wt. 479; IUPAC Name N-[9-(ortho-carboxyphenyl)-6-(diethylamino)-3Hxanthen-3-ylidene] diethyl ammonium chloride), is a highly water soluble, basic red dye of the xanthene class. It is
found as a reddish violet powder and comes under the trade name of D & C Red No. 19. It is widely used as a colorant
in textiles and food stuﬀs, and is also a well-known water tracer ﬂuorescent. It is harmful if swallowed by human
beings and animals, and causes irritation to the skin, eyes and respiratory tract [1]. The aim of this work is to do a
comparative study of the performance of the M06 family of density functionals for the description of the chemical
reactivity of Rhodamine B.
The knowledge of reactivity on a molecule is an essential concept; it is of a crucial interest because it allows to
understand interactions that are operating during a reaction mechanism. In particular electrostatic interactions have
been successfully explained by the use of the molecular electrostatic potential [2, 3].
On the other hand, there is no a unique tool to quantify and rationalize covalent interactions, however since 2005
a descriptor of local reactivity whose name is simply dual descriptor [4, 5], has allowed to rationalize reaction mechanisms in terms of overlapping nucleophilic regions with electrophilic regions in order to get a maximum stabilization
thus leading to ﬁnal products or intermediates; all those favorable nucleophilic–electrophilic interactions have been

explained as a manifestation of the Principle of Maximum Hardness [6] in addition, chemical reactions have been
understood in terms of the The Hard and Soft Acids and Bases Principle [7–10], principle that has been used even
with the aim of replacing the use of the Molecular Orbital Theory to understand the whole Chemistry [11]. In fact
the present work is a good chance to test the capability of the most recent reactivity descriptors coming from the
Conceptual DFT [12–15], therefore the framework of this conceptual theory will be presented in the next section.
2. Theory and Computational Details
At a local level, electronic density is the ﬁrst local reactivity descriptor to be used when electrostatic interactions
are predominant between molecules; within the framework of Conceptual DFT it is deﬁned as follows:
ρ(r) =

δE
δυ(r)

(1)
N

But when chemical reactions are governed by interactions mainly of covalent nature, in such a case a second
order LRD called Fukui function [14] is used instead of electronic density. Fukui function is deﬁned in terms of the
derivative of ρ(r) with respect to N; through a Maxwell relation, the same descriptor is interpreted as the variation of
μ with respect to υ(r) [14]:
f (r) =

∂ ρ(r)
∂N

υ(r)

=

δμ
δυ(r)

(2)
N

The function f (r) reﬂects the ability of a molecular site to accept or donate electrons. High values of f (r) are
related to a high reactivity at point r [14].
Since the number of electrons N is a discrete variable[16], right and left derivatives of ρ(r) with respect to N have
emerged. By applying a ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation to Eq (2), two deﬁnitions of Fukui functions depending on
total electronic densities are obtained:

f + (r) =

∂ ρ(r)
∂N

f − (r) =

∂ ρ(r)
∂N

+
υ(r)
−
υ(r)

= ρN+1 (r) − ρN (r)

(3)

= ρN (r) − ρN−1 (r)

(4)

where ρN+1 (r), ρN (r) and ρN−1 (r) are the electronic densities at point r for the system with N +1, N and N −1 electrons,
respectively. The ﬁrst one, f + (r), has been associated to reactivity for a nucleophilic attack so that it measures the
intramolecular reactivity at the site r toward a nucleophilic reagent. The second one, f − (r), has been associated to
reactivity for an electrophilic attack so that this function measures the intramolecular reactivity at the site r toward an
electrophilic reagent [17].
The densities of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), ρL (r) (LUMO density) and ρH (r) (HOMO density), come to
the picture since it has been shown [17, 18] that when the frozen orbital approximation (FOA) is used there is a direct
relation between f +/− (r) and the density of the appropriate FMO thus avoiding calculations of the system with N + 1
and N − 1 electrons:
f + (r)
f − (r)

ρL (r) ,

(5)

ρH (r) .

(6)

On the other hand, the use of Eqs (5) and (6) instead of Eqs (3) and (4) allows one to diminish the computational eﬀort without loosing the qualitative picture of the local reactivity, but this approach should be always checked
by comparison of these two couples of working equations because the ﬁrst level of approximation based on total
electronic densities will always be more accurate that the second level of approximation based on densities of FMOs.
Condensation to atoms is achieved through integration within the kth –atomic domain Ωk [19, 20]:

818

Daniel Glossman-Mitnik / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 816 – 825

fk+/− =

Ωk

f +/− (r) dr .

(7)

fk+/− is now an atomic index that is used to characterize the electrophilic/nucleophilic power of atom k.
Even much better, Morell et al. [5, 9, 11, 21–24] have proposed a local reactivity descriptor (LRD) which is
called the dual descriptor (DD) f (2) (r) ≡ Δ f (r). In spite of having been discovered several years ago, a solid physical
interpretation was not provided in such a moment. [25]. They used the notation Δ f (r), but currently it has been
replaced by the modern notation f (2) (r) in order to highlight that this is a Fukui function of second order. Its physical
meaning is to reveal nucleophilic and electrophilic sites on a molecular system at the same time. Mathematically it is
deﬁned in terms of the derivative of the Fukui function, f (r)[14], with respect to the number of electrons, N. Through
a Maxwell relation, this LRD may be interpreted as the variation of η (the molecular hardness which measures the
resistance to charge transfer [26]) with respect to υ(r), the external potential. The deﬁnition of f (2) (r) is shown as
indicated by Morell et al. [5, 9]:
f (2) (r) =

∂ f (r)
∂N

υ(r)

=

δη
δυ(r)

.

(8)

N

As mentioned above, DD allows one to obtain simultaneously the preferably sites for nucleophilic attacks ( f (2) (r) >
0) and the preferably sites for electrophilic attacks ( f (2) (r) < 0) into the system at point r. DD has demonstrated to be
a robust tool to predict speciﬁc sites of nucleophilic and electrophilic attacks in a much more eﬃcient way than the
Fukui function by itself because dual descriptor is able to distinguish those sites of true nucleophilic and electrophilic
behavior, in consequence some works have been published with the aim of remarking the powerfulness of f (2) (r) and
all those LRDs depending on DD [5, 9, 11, 21–24].
The general working equation to obtain DD is given by the diﬀerence between nucleophilic and electrophilic
Fukui function [11]. A well–known ﬁrst level of approximation implies the use of ﬁnite diﬀerence method where to
the sum of electronic densities of the system with one more electron and one less electron is subtracted by the double
of the total electronic density of the original system. Since this level of approximation implies a time–demanding
computing, a second level of approximation has been used for some years where the densities of FMOs provide an
easier–to–compute working equation:
f (2) (r) =

f + (r) − f − (r)

ρL (r) − ρH (r) ,

where densities of LUMO and HOMO are represented by ρL (r) and ρH (r), respectively.
Molecular symmetry can inﬂuence upon the local reactivity, and on the other hand has been demonstrated that the
Fukui function must conserve the symmetry [27]. In addition, as the degeneration that may arise in frontier molecular
orbitals is related with the molecular symmetry, within the framework of the second level of approximation, this
phenomenon has been taken into account thus providing a mathematical expression to be applied on closed–shell
molecular systems [28].
Hence, when an interaction between two species is well described through the use of this LRD, it is said the reaction is controlled by frontier molecular orbitals (or frontier–controlled) under the assumption that remaining molecular
orbitals do not participate during the reaction.
The dual descriptor can also be condensed through an appropriate integration within the kth –atomic domain Ωk :

Ωk

f (2) (r) dr = fk(2) .

(9)

When fk(2) > 0 the process is driven by a nucleophilic attack on atom k and then that atom acts an electrophilic
species; conversely, when fk(2) < 0 the process is driven by an electrophilic attack over atom k and therefore atom k
acts as a nucleophilic species.

3. Settings and Computational Methods
All computational studies were performed with the Gaussian 09 [29] series of programs with density functional
methods as implemented in the computational package. The equilibrium geometries of the molecules were determined
by means of the gradient technique. The force constants and vibrational frequencies were determined by computing
analytical frequencies on the stationary points obtained after the optimization to check if there were true minima. The
basis set used in this work was MIDIY, which is the same basis set as MIDI! with a polarization function added to
the hydrogen atoms. The MIDI! basis is a small double-zeta basis with polarization functions on N-F, Si-Cl, Br, and I
[30–35].
For the calculation of the molecular structure and properties of the studied system, we have chosen the hybrid
meta-GGA density functionals M06, M06L, M06-2X and M06HF [36], which consistently provide satisfactory results
for several structural and thermodynamic properties [36–38].
Within the conceptual framework of DFT [14, 26], the chemical potential μ, which measures the escaping tendency
of electron from equilibrium, is deﬁned as:
μ=

∂E
∂N

= −χ

(10)

v(r)

where χ is the electronegativity.
The global hardness η can be seen as the resistance to charge transfer:
η=

1 ∂2 E
2 ∂N 2

(11)
v(r)

Using a ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation and Koopmans’ theorem [32–35], the above expressions can be written
as:
1
1
(12)
μ ≈ − (I + A) ≈ ( L + H )
2
2
1
1
η ≈ (I − A) ≈ ( L − H )
(13)
2
2
where H and L are the energies of the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, HOMO and
LUMO, respectively. However, within the context of density functional theory, the above inequalities are justiﬁed in
light of the work of Perdew and Levy [39], where they commented on the signiﬁcance of the highest occupied Kohn–
Sham eigenvalue, and proved the ionization potential theorems for the exact Kohn–Sham density functional theory
of a many–electron system. In addition the use of the energies of frontier molecular orbitals as an approximation to
obtain I and A is supported by the Janak’s Theorem [40]. In particular, The negative of Hartree–Fock and Kohn–
Sham HOMO orbital has been found to deﬁne upper and lower limits, respectively, for the experimental values of the
ﬁrst ionization potential[41] thus validating the use of energies of Kohn–Sham frontier molecular orbital to calculate
reactivity descriptors coming from Conceptual DFT.
The electrophilicity index ω represents the stabilization energy of the systems when it gets saturated by electrons
coming from the surrounding:
ω=

μ2
(I + A)2
( L + H )2
≈
≈
2η 2(I − A) 2( L − H )

(14)

The electronegativity μ, the total hardness η and the electrophilicity index ω are global indices that describe the
reactivity of a molecule in terms of the initial electron distribution in that molecule. There are other methodologies
that explain the reactivity in terms of the initial molecule and the resulting adduct with which the initial molecule
reacts that have been recently presented [42, 43].
The condensed Fukui functions can also be employed to determine the reactivity of each atom in the molecule.
The corresponding condensed functions are given by fk+ = qk (N + 1) − qk (N) (for nucleophilic attack), where qk is the
gross charge of atom k in the molecule.

820

Daniel Glossman-Mitnik / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 816 – 825

It is possible to evaluate condensed Fukui functions from single–points calculations directly, without resorting to
additional calculations involving the systems with N − 1 and N + 1 electrons:
⎡
⎤
⎢⎢⎢
⎥⎥⎥

(where i = HOMO)

(16)

with cai being the LCAO coeﬃcients and Sab the overlap matrix. The condensed Fukui functions are normalized, thus
k fk =1.
The condensed Fukui functions have been calculated using the AOMix molecular analysis program [44, 45] starting from single-point energy calculations. We have presented, discussed and successfully applied the described procedure in our previous studies on diﬀerent molecular systems [46–49].
The electron donating (ω− ) and electron accepting (ω+ ) powers have been deﬁned as [50]:
ω− =

(3I + A)2
16(I − A)

(17)

ω+ =

(I + 3A)2
16(I − A)

(18)

and

It follows that a larger ω+ value corresponds to a better capability of accepting charge, whereas a smaller value of
ω value of a system makes it a better electron donor. In order to compare ω+ with -ω− , the following deﬁnition of
net electrophilicity has been proposed [51]:
−

Δω± = ω+ − (−ω− ) = ω+ + ω−

(19)

that is, the electron accepting power relative to the electron donating power.
4. Results and Discussion
The molecular structure of Rhodamine B was pre-optimized by starting with the readily available PDB structure,
and ﬁnding the most stable conformer by means of the Conformers module of Materials Studio through a random
sampling with molecular mechanics techniques and a consideration of all the torsional angles. The structure of the resulting conformer was then optimized with the M06, M06L, M06-2X and M06-HF density functionals in conjunction
with the MIDIY basis set. The optimized molecular structure of the Rhodamine B molecule (with the M06 density
functional) is shown in Figure 1.
The validity of the Koopmans’ theorem within the DFT approximation is controversial. However, it has been
shown [41] that although the KS orbitals may diﬀer in shape and energy from the HF orbitals, the combination of
them produces Conceptual DFT reactivity descriptors that correlate quite well with the reactivity descriptors obtained
through Hartree-Fock calculations. Thus, it is worth to calculate the electronegativity, global hardness and global
electrophilicity for the studied systems using both approximations in order to verify the quality of the procedures. It
is important to mention that when one considers the derivative of a quantity at constant external potential, it means
that the changes in the quantity are analyzed for a ﬁxed position of the nuclei. These types of changes are known as
vertical diﬀerences, precisely because the nuclei positions are not allowed to relax to a new position associated with a
lower total energy.
The HOMO and LUMO orbital energies (in eV), ionization potentials I and electron aﬃnities A (in eV), and global
electronegativity χ, total hardness η, and global electrophilicity ω of the Rhodamine B molecule calculated with the
M06, M06L, M06-2X and M06-HF density functionals and the MIDIY basis set are presented in Table 1. The upper
part of the table shows the results derived assuming the validity of Koopmans’ theorem and the lower part shows
the results derived from the calculated vertical I and A. As can be seen from Table 1, the Koopman’s theorem holds

approximately for the density functionals which include some percentage of HF exchange, but it fails completely for
the M06L density functional (without inclusion of HF exchange).
The condensed Fukui functions can also be employed to determine the reactivity of each atom in the molecule. The
corresponding condensed functions are given by fk+ = qk (N+1)−qk (N) (for nucleophilic attack), fk− = qk (N)−qk (N−1)
(for electrophilic attack), and fk0 = [qk (N + 1) − qk (N − 1)]/2 (for radical attack), where qk is the gross charge of atom
k in the molecule.
It is possible to evaluate condensed Fukui functions from single-points calculations directly, without resorting to
additional calculations involving the systems with N-1 and N+1 electrons:

with cai being the LCAO coeﬃcients and Sab the overlap matrix. The condensed Fukui functions are normalized, thus

k fk =1 and fk =[ fk + fk ]/2.
The condensed Fukui functions have been calculated using the AOMix molecular analysis program [44, 45] starting from single-point energy calculations. We have presented, discussed and successfully applied the described procedure in our previous studies on diﬀerent molecular systems [46–49].
The condensed dual descriptor has been deﬁned as f (2) (r)k = f+k - f−k [5, 9]. From the interpretation given to the
Fukui function, one can note that the sign of the dual descriptor is very important to characterize the reactivity of a
site within a molecule toward a nucleophilic or an electrophilic attack. That is, if f (2) (r)k > 0, then the site is favored
for a nucleophilic attack, whereas if f (2) (r)k < 0, then the site may be favored for an electrophilic attack [5, 9, 52].

It can be conclude from the analysis of the results on Table 2 and by the interpretation for the dual descriptor
presented before, that C6 will be the preferred site for nucleophilic attack. On the contrary, there is no preferred site
for the electrophilic attack. Indeed, if we include the Cl atom in this Table, we will ﬁnd that all four density functionals
display a large negative value of the condensed dual descriptor f (2) (r) over that atom. Indeed, this will not change the
values of the condensed dual descriptor over the other atoms.
The electrodonating (ω− ) and electroaccepting (ω+ ) powers and net electrophilicity Δω± of the Rhodamine B
molecule calculated with the M06, M06L, M06-2X and M06-HF density functionals and the MIDIY basis set are
presented in Table 3. The upper part of the table shows the results derived assuming the validity of Koopmans’
theorem and the lower part shows the results derived from the calculated vertical I and A.

The results from Table 3 clearly indicate that Rhodamine B is an electrodonating molecule, with the same result
predicted by all the four density functionals considered in this study. However, only the results obtained through
the calculations with the M06, M06-2X and M06-HF density functionals are in fairly agreement between those from
vertical calculations of I and A and those coming from the assumption of the validity of the Koopmans’ theorem in
DFT.
5. Conclusions
From the whole of the results presented in this contribution it has been clearly demonstrated that the sites of
interaction of the Rhodamine B molecule can be predicted by using DFT-based reactivity descriptors such as the
hardness, softness, and electrophilicity, as well as Fukui function calculations. These descriptors were used in the

824

characterization and successfully description of the preferred reactive sites and provide a ﬁrm explanation for the
reactivity of the Rhodamine B molecule.
The M06 family of density functionals (M06, M06L, M06-2X and M06-HF) used in the present work leads to the
same qualitatively and quantitatively similar description of the chemistry and reactivity of the Rhodamine B molecule,
yielding reasonable results. However, for the case of the M06L functional, which does not include HF exchange, the
agreement between the results obtained through energy calculations and those that assume the validity of of the
Koopmans’ theorem is deﬁnitively not true.
