Abstract. The objective of this study is to show the highly complex features of
rotational turbulent flow using a widely known finite volume code. The flow
subjected to an orthogonal rotation is investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively in a three-dimensional channel and a duct using FLUENT. The predictions of rotational flow calculations, presented for low Reynolds numbers, both
in channel and duct are in good agreement with the DNS predictions. It is of interest to present the capability of the code for capturing the multi-physics of internal flow phenomena and to discuss the Coriolis effects for two rotational
rates. The results show that FLUENT is able to predict accurately first and second order turbulent statistics and it also captures the proper secondary flow
physics which occur due to rotation and the geometry itself. These results are
very encouraging for the simulation of the flow in a centrifugal compressor,
which is the main goal of the authors in the long term.

1 Introduction
It is well known that investigation of the turbulent fluid motion is a challenging research area; neither an analytical solution exists nor it can be exactly defined mathematically. Its complexity is generally explained with its unsteadiness, threedimensionality, dissipative and diffusive features. In addition, it contains a broad
spectrum, which is formed by various size of eddies. For example, scales of these
eddies can be of the order of the size of the flow geometry and of the size of Kolmogorov scale, which is known as the smallest scale. Even without rotation, turbulent is
certainly a multiscale process. Combining the effects of rotation with turbulence
makes the flow physics more interesting, however more complex, and difficult to
analyze either experimentally or numerically. It was confirmed by previous studies
that rotation changes not only the mean flow but also the turbulence field itself. Although, there exist a wide range of studies in literature as to how and why the multiphysics of these flows are affected depending on the Reynolds and rotation numbers,

criteria still remains to be formulated clearly for practical industrial flow applications
including the centrifugal compressor.
The present study analyzes a turbulent rotating channel flow at a low Reynolds
number of Re=2800 for two rotation numbers of Ro=0.1 and Ro=0.5 (Re=Ubh/v,
Ro=2Ωh/Ub, where Ub is the bulk velocity, h is the half width of the channel, v is the
kinematic viscosity and Ω is the rotation rate of the flow). In addition, the turbulent
duct flow is investigated at a low Reynolds number of Re=4410 for two rotation numbers of Ro=0.013 and Ro=0.053 (Re=UbD/v, Ro=2ΩD/Ub, where D stands for the
hydraulic diameter of the duct).

2 The Model
For the channel flow, dimensions of the geometry are Lx=6.4h, Ly=2h, Lz=3.2h. For
the duct flow, spanwise and radial lengths are set to be equal to Ly=Lz=D while the
streamwise length is taken as Lx=6.28D. The flow is assumed to be fully developed,
isothermal, incompressible and rotating at a fixed positive angular velocity parallel to
the spanwise direction, Ω=(0,0, Ω).
The numerical calculations were performed using the development version of the
general-purpose code FLUENT V6.2 [1] using the Dynamic Smagorinsly-Lilly Model
[2],[3]. The code is based on a finite-volume method with an unstructured grid algorithm. The LES incorporates 2nd order central differencing for the diffusive and convective terms for the channel flow calculations and 3rd order MUSCL for duct flow
calculations. A fully second-order implicit scheme is applied for temporal discretization while the PISO algorithm and PRESTO! scheme are employed for the velocitypressure coupling and pressure interpolation, respectively.
The computational domain is formed by 66 × 66 × 66 and 66 × 60 × 60 cells (in the
x,y and z-directions) for channel flow and duct flow, respectively. The computational
grid is equally spaced along the homogenous directions (x and z-directions for channel and x-direction for the duct) and stretched non-uniformly between the solid walls
[from y=0 (bottom wall) to y=2h (top wall) in the channel, from y=0 (bottom wall) to
y=D (top wall) and from z=0 (lateral wall) to z=D (lateral wall) in the duct]. Non-slip
boundary conditions and periodic boundary conditions were applied for the walls and
homogenous directions, respectively. Constant mass flow rate was assumed in the
flow directions rather than constant pressure drop.

3 Results and Discussion
Fig. 1. shows the distribution of mean and turbulent intensities for low and high rotational rates. For both cases, excellent agreement for the mean velocity was found with
the DNS data [4] except for a slight increase near the pressure side (y=0) at the low
rotation rate. For this case, radial and spanwise turbulent intensities are remarkably
under-predicted near the pressure side, but they gradually approach the DNS data
through center of the channel. Spanwise intensity, which is mainly responsible for
turbulent kinetic energy, is under- and over-predicted near the pressure and suctions
sides, respectively. For the high rotational case, similar trends are obtained however
the discrepancies and the range that is affected are smaller in this case.

Spatial distribution of the mean velocity and turbulent intensities for half of the
square duct is also shown for two rotational cases in Fig. 2. The peak region of the
predicted mean velocity (a2) has a tendency to shift towards the bottom corner; otherwise, the LES predictions are in good agreement with the DNS data [5] for both
rotational cases. Streamwise turbulent intensity (b2) seems to be consistent with the
DNS, but the remaining intensities (c2,d2) are remarkably under-predicted. However,
the under-prediction for Ro=0.053 is less than that for Ro=0.013. Notwithstanding
these discrepancies, our results are similar to those of Palleres and Davidson [6]. Considering the increase in rotational number, mean velocity and turbulent intensity decrease near the suction side and increases towards the pressure and lateral side of the
duct. The normal and spanwise turbulent intensities are observed to be reduced near
the suction side and become enhanced near the pressure side.

4 Conclusion
Spanwise rotating channel and duct flow were investigated at low Reynolds numbers
using LES. Although there are some discrepancies at low rotational numbers, the
results are generally in good agreement with DNS predictions. These discrepancies
are thought to be caused primarily by the SGS model incorporated in FLUENT. Additionally, the highest accuracy for the numerical schemes in the code is third order: it is
well known that such attributes might provide another source for discrepancies.
Concerning future studies, plans are already underway to test different SGS models, including dynamic kinetic energy SGS model [7] and the wall-adapting local
eddy-viscosity (WALE) model [8], in order to understand the performances of these
SGS models for rotating channel and duct flow problems.
