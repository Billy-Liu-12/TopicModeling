Abstract. A clear advantage of broken symmetry (BS) unrestricted density
functional theory DFT is qualitatively correct description of bond dissociation
process, but its disadvantage is that spin-polarized Slater determinant is no
longer a pure spin state (a.k.a. spin contamination). We propose a new approach
to eliminate the spin-contamination, based on canonical Natural Orbitals (NO).
We derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure singlet state given in
terms of energy of BS DFT solution, the occupation number of the bonding NO,
and the energy of the higher state built on these bonding and antibonding NOs
(as opposed to self-consistent Kohn-Sham orbitals). Thus, unlike spincontamination correction schemes by Noodleman and Yamaguchi, spincorrection is introduced for each correlated electron pair individually and thus
expected to give more accurate results. We validate this approach on two examples, a simple diatomic H2 and transition metal hydride MnH.

1 Introduction
Difficulties in DFT description of the bond dissociation are routed in the fact that
DFT was derived based on assumption of non-degenerate system [1, 2]. A clear advantage of unrestricted (also known as spin-polarized or broken spin-symmetry) solution is qualitatively correct description of bond dissociation process [3, 4]. Since exact
exchange-correlation functional is not known, unrestricted Kohn-Sham (UKS) treatment improves approximate functionals by taking part of the static electron correlation into account. The situation can be seen as localization of α and β electrons on the
left and right atoms of the dissociating bonds, respectively (left-right electron correlation). Broken symmetry (BS) UKS thus describes the transition from closed shell
system to biradical smoothly, which is not possible with restricted open shell KS
(ROKS) approach.
A disadvantage of UKS approach is that spin-polarized Slater determinant is no
longer an eigenfunction of the spin operator. Hence, the average value of <Ŝ2> is not,
generally equal to the correct value of Sz(Sz+1) [5]. Here Sz is ½ of the difference in
total numbers of α and β electrons. This situation is known as spin contamination and
<Ŝ2> is often used as its measure. The common rule [6] is to neglect spin contamination if <Ŝ2> differs from Sz(Sz+1) by less than 10%. As a result of spin contamination,
molecular geometry may be distorted toward the high-spin state one, spin density

often becomes incorrect, and electron energy differs from the pure spin state ones.
While some researchers argue that this spin contamination in DFT should be ignored
[3] others recognize it as a problem affecting the energy. Possible solutions to spin
contamination problem include constrained DFT [7, 8] and spin contamination correction schemes [9, 10], discussed below.
Heisenberg exchange coupling parameter J is often used to describe the difference
in energy between the low and the high spin state. Positive value of J corresponds to
ferromagnetic, and negative value corresponds to anti-ferromagnetic coupling. Since
BS-DFT does not produce the energies of the pure spin states, the expression for J
must account for spin contamination. The following expressions had been suggested
for this purpose [11-14]:

Of these three, J3 suggested by Yamaguchi can be reduced to J1 and J2 in the weak and
strong limits, respectively.
A more complicated expressions for variable spin-correction, including dependence of J on overlap between corresponding spin polarized orbitals p and q were also
derived recently [15, 16]. This approach was shown to result in more accurate J values for Cu2+ binuclear complexes [16, 17]. However, this variable spin-correction
approach had not been applied to systems with two or more correlated electron pairs.
In this contribution we apply spin correction approach to study two diatomics, a simple dihydride H2 and transition metal hydride MnH.

2 Theory
Here we propose an alternative approach to variable spin-correction, based on canonical Natural Orbitals (NO) [18]. First, let us consider a diatomic system AB with one
correlated electron pair, such as stretched H2 molecule. We assume that restricted
Kohn-Sham formalism yields higher energy for this system than unrestricted one, as
the case of H2 molecule far from equilibrium. Unrestricted KS description produces
the natural orbitals a, b as eigenvectors of the total density matrix with the orbital
occupation numbers na, nb as corresponding eigenvalues. We further assume that
na<nb which means that orbital a is antibonding, and orbital b is bonding NO. They
are symmetry-adapted (a is Σu and b is Σg in case of H2 molecule). Corresponding
spin-polarized broken symmetry orbitals p, q can be expressed [19] as a linear combination of a and b using polarization parameter λ:

p=

1
1+ λ

2

(b + λa ); q =

1
1 + λ2

(b − λa )

(2)

This parameter is determined by the occupation numbers na and nb as shown below. If alpha and beta electrons are localized on different parts of the molecule and do
not overlap, the polarization parameter become unity and we arrive to Noodleman’s
weak interaction limit. In the general case of many-electron system the orbitals of the
alpha set, besides being orthogonal to each other, are also orthogonal to the orbitals of

Pairwise Spin-Contamination Correction Method and DFT Study

the beta set for a single exception of the corresponding beta orbital. The spin polarized orbitals obtained with the most standard quantum chemistry codes do not possess
this property, which is why one has to produce the corresponding spin-polarized orbitals from NOs. BS solution can still be written as the Slater determinant in the basis of
these corresponding orbitals as:
BS = 1

2 pα q β =

1 p1α 1 p2α 2
2 q1 β1q 2 β 2

(3)

Substitution of the corresponding orbitals from (2) into (3) separates the pure singlet
and triplet components:

where indexes 1 and 2 mark coordinates of the electrons. The first term in this expression contains the linear combination of the two closed-shell singlets, the lower closed

S1 = b1b2

and the higher closed shell singlet S2:
S 2 = a1 a 2

α 1 β 2 − β1α 2

while the second term is proportional to one of the possible triplet states: T = T0 2 ,
T0 =

(a1b2 − b1a 2 ) α 1 β 2 + β1α 2
2

(8)

This triplet contribution is the reason why UKS solution is spin contaminated.
Therefore, we are looking to extract the energy of the singlet term from BS energy
EBS using the energy of the triplet. The expectation value of Kohn-Sham operator Ĥ
then becomes,

The last two terms in (9) vanish out due to orthogonality of S and T states, introduced in (4).

S | S = b1b2 − λ 2 a1 a 2 | b1b2 − λ 2 a1 a 2 = 1 + λ 4
Using normalization condition and Substituting (10) into (4) one can obtain:

(13)

In non-relativistic case, the energy of the triplet T0 is the same as the energy ET for
the single determinant triplet T1=a1α1\b2α2;

ET = T1 Hˆ T1 = T0 Hˆ T0

(14)

Then the energy ES' of the pure singlet S0 can be found from (14) as

This energy includes the non-dynamic electron correlation effects arising from the
mixing of S1 and S2 states. In order to relate the polarization parameter λ to the occupation numbers na, nb, we can expand the electron density matrix in the basis of a and
b orbitals.

Thus, for a system with one correlated electron pair one can obtain the pure singlet
energy expressed in terms of energy of BS UKS solution, the occupation number of
the bonding NO, and the energy of the triplet built on these bonding and antibonding
NOs (as opposed to self-consistent KS orbitals). This expression is applicable to two
–electron systems as well as to the systems which have in addition the unpolarized
electron core or ferromagnetically coupled unpaired electrons. Extension to this technique to the case of several correlated electron pairs will be presented elsewhere. All
systems, considered in this study were found to have only pair of fractionally occupied NOs, in addition to singly occupied and unpolarized MOs.
Most importantly our approach does not use spin operator for the correction; it
considers natural occupancies. At present our approach is good to study spin contaminated systems with one correlated pair.
Thus, for a system with one correlated electron pair one can obtain the pure singlet
energy expressed in terms of energy of BS UKS solution, the occupation number of
the bonding NO, and the energy of the triplet built on these bonding and antibonding
NOs (as opposed to self-consistent KS orbitals). This expression is applicable to twoelectron systems as well as to the systems which have in addition the unpolarized
electron core or ferromagnetically coupled unpaired electrons.
We will turn next to the systems with two correlated electron pairs, In that case (9)
can be written as:
E BS = BS1 ⋅ BS 2 Hˆ BS1 ⋅ BS 2

Here we derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure singlet state from the
energy of the broken symmetry DFT description of the low-spin state and energies of
the high-spin states: pentuplet and two spin-contaminated triplets. Thus, unlike spincontamination correction schemes by Noodleman [20] and Yamaguchi [13], spincorrection is introduced for each correlated electron pair individually and there fore is
expected to give more accurate results.

3 Computational Details
We studied Potential Energy Curves (PEC) for hydrogen dimer H2 and transition
metal hydride MnH to validate the spin-contamination correction approach described
above in section 2. MnH calculations were done with Gaussian03 [21] program using
all-electron Wachters+f [22, 23] basis set. For H2 we have used aug-cc-pVQZ basis
set with CCSD and spin-polarized (unrestricted) DFT calculations.
Spin-correction described above in theory section is implemented as a combination
of unix shell script and FORTRAN code. It reads Natural Orbitals (NO) printout from
Gaussian03 job (keyword used was Punch=NO) and converts them into spinpolarized molecular orbitals. Script uses a threshold parameter to identify the correlated pair. The spin polarization of the electron core was neglected by adjusting the

Pairwise Spin-Contamination Correction Method and DFT Study

147

threshold value to consider natural occupations integer. The provision is made for the
spin-up orbital p to be the one largely localized on metal atom and, so that spin-down
orbital q is predominantly localized on H atom. The new alpha orbital set is made of
doubly occupied NOs, orbital p, singly occupied NOs, and weekly occupied NOs. The
new beta orbital set was identical, except that p was replaced with q. These orbitals
were further used to evaluate the energy with single SCF step and verify that it is
close to BS energy obtained at self-consistence. The energy of the triplet is calculated
with another single SCF step using the original NOs only. It was used by the script to
extract the energy of the pure singlet. The keywords used for single SCF step with the
modified orbital set were SCF (MaxCycle=1) and Guess=Cards.

4 Results and Discussion
Fig. 1 illustrates potential energy curves for H2 with CCSD, BMK (uncorrected and
corrected) and conventional Yamaguchi spin contamination correction based on S2
value. One can see from the figure the difference appear at the shoulder of the potential energy surface, where uncorrected BMK curve significantly overestimate the
energies. The corrected curve with our new spin-contamination correction code efficiently finds the point of difference and corrects the energy to give potential energy
curve similar to that of wavefunction method CCSD. We have also plotted the
conventional correction based spin operator by Yamaguchi et. al. for comparison
purpose. Though both the corrections are equally good in predicting energies at the
accuracy of wavefunction theory level CCSD, our approach is based on actual occupation nos., which would perform better when number of electron correlated pair will
increase in the study. The further validation of the system with more than two electron
correlation pairs will be discussed in future.

In another attempt to check our new approach we considered more complex system MnH. Fig. 2 illustrates potential energy curve of two spin states of transition
metal hydride, MnH with pure and hybrid DFT functionals TPSS and BMK. Our
results are compared with PEC of only available WFT method MCSCF+SOCI in
Fig 2 to equilibrium bond length for M=5. Table 1 shows the correction, introduced in
Section 2, stabilizes this spin state by 3.1 kcal/mol below M=7, in agreement with
experimental value reported in Borane et. al. [24] Thus, spin-corrected BMK predicts
the ground state for MnH to have the multiplicity of 5 and accurately reproduces
experimental De.

5 Conclusion
Here we derive an expression to extract the energy of the pure singlet state expressed
in terms of energy of BS UKS solution, the occupation number of the bonding NO,
and the energy of the triplet built on these bonding and antibonding NOs (as opposed
to self-consistent KS orbitals). Thus, unlike spin-contamination correction schemes by
Noodleman and Yamaguchi, spin-correction is introduced for each correlated electron
pair individually and thus expected to give more accurate results. Diatomics considered for this study were found to have only pair of fractionally occupied NOs, in addition to singly occupied and unpolarized MOs. Our approach successfully predicts the
correct spin state as validated by dihydrogen and manganese hydride in this study.
This opens the venue to study more complicated enzymatic systems involving transition metals, more accurately with the help of DFT.
