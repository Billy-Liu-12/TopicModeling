2 Problem statement
Scientific collaboration is a very complex research topic, which has been actively studied for several
decades [1]. The principles and characteristics under investigation differ from one paper to another [2],
[3], but in many cases authors build collaboration networks using the research papers [4]. Analysis of
the co-authorship collaboration has demonstrated positive effect on the overall scientific impact of the
paper [5], [6]. Nevertheless, many researchers agree that the collaboration usually starts from the
informal interactions, such as conversations during conferences [7]. However, collaboration networks
based solely on the scientific papers cannot represent social interactions between people at the full
extent. Taking this into account, we need to use the information from both the research papers and social
networks in order to find the commencing collaborations and better understand the existing ones.

3 Hybrid similarity network
The general concept of building hybrid similarity networks looks as follows:
1. Identify features of users, which reflect the scientific interaction of a user with others, for each data
source (ResearchGate, Scopus, Twitter, etc.).
2. Calculate values of these features for all users.
3. Combine these features into the unified value of users’ similarity in a particular source.
4. Combine values of users’ similarity for different sources into the general measure of users’
similarity.
5. Build a graph of overall users’ similarity, where each node stands for the user and the weight of
every edge is defined through a value of the general similarity measure for two users, connected by
this edge.
The rules of features combinations on steps 3 and 4 are up to the implementation, in current research
they were chosen quite simple – normalize and sum the features being combined. It makes all features
and sources make an equal degree of contribution into the general similarity measure, which is, in
absence of the scientifically justified differences in the features’ contribution, the fairest approach.
In this work for building the hybrid scientific similarity network we chose social network
ResearchGate, as the largest academia network today [8], and the Scopus database, as the largest abstract
and citation database of peer-reviewed literature [9].

3.1 Hybrid network construction
For building the similarity network for the users of ResearchGate and Scopus, the first step is to
define the characteristics of users, based on which the network is build. After analyzing the contents of
users’ profiles on the ResearchGate website and data, provided by Scopus, we identified following
characteristics, which reflect the research interests of the person and interactions with other researchers:
publications, followers, departments and endorsements for ResearchGate network, and authors,
references, keywords for Scopus network. For each network we calculated values of stated
characteristics and normalized them. Then we combined two networks into one to construct hybrid
network – for every pair of users we sum the unified similarity measures for two datasets. We do not
perform normalization of these measures in order to keep the proportions of their impacts on the general
similarity measure.
For the demonstration of the result of hybrid network formation we selected a random user from the
collected dataset and created three networks for him (Figure 2).

Figure 2 – Similarity networks for the selected user
We can see a large number of connections (74 total) with other users from the dataset through
ResearchGate (Figure 2a), and these connections vary by weight. In Figure 2b the similarity network
based on the articles from Scopus is presented. There are 22 connections and one of them is much
stronger than others. The hybrid similarity network for the target user is presented in Figure 2c. The
total number of connections in it is 92, which means that there are four users in the dataset, who are
connected with the target user through both ResearchGate and Scopus.

4 Experimental evaluation
For the experimental evaluation of the proposed approach we collected a dataset of ResearchGate
users from the research areas, related to the computer science. Since the policy of the site does not allow
automated crawling of the data, we manually collected the information about 907 users and processed
their profiles according to Section 3.1. We built networks for all features of users and then created
network for the unified measure of users’ similarity. To evaluate the overall quality of the networks we
calculated graph metrics. Results of the analysis are presented in Table 1.

From Table 1 we can see that the unified similarity network covers the whole dataset and has greatly
improved topology – lower average path length and increased centralities. Clustering coefficients are
also very high, which means that users in the network are closely connected. Thus we can say that the
unified similarity measure allows to generate better interaction network for the ResearchGate platform.
Unusual values of metrics for the departments network are because the network consists of small
independent clusters.
On the next step we matched ResearchGate profiles with the profiles from the Scopus database with
the use of the rule described in Section 3.1. We were able to obtain 697 Scopus profiles. Not ideal results
(77%) are related to the simplicity of the matching rule, as well as to the fact that some users provide
incorrect data about their full names. We built networks for all features of authors and then created
network for the unified measure of users’ similarity. Evaluation metrics were the same as for the
ResearchGate networks. Results of the analysis are presented in Table 2.

From the table we can clearly understand that the unified network primarily consists of the keywords
network. But it is worth mentioning that, due to the high clustering of co-authors and references
networks, their impact on the connection strength for edges, in which they are included, will be
considerable.
Finally, we build the hybrid similarity network using the unified similarity measures of
ResearchGate and Scopus networks. After that we compare metrics of three networks to check the effect
of combining two similarity networks. Results of the analysis are presented in Table 3.

The table shows that the hybrid similarity network has better values of centralities which is related
to the larger number of edges. Clustering coefficients and average path length are comparable to the
ResearchGate network and much better than in the Scopus network. Thus, the hybrid similarity network
behaves identically or better than the networks built separately on one of the networks.
To demonstrate the effect of the hybrid approach for the similarity network building on the resulting
connections between users we randomly selected five users from the initial dataset of ResearchGate
users and created three similarity networks for them. Images of the resulting networks are presented in
Figure 4.

The ResearchGate similarity network (Figure 4a) demonstrates the presence of large group of
connected users in the center, and there are also two users, who act as hubs – they are solely connected

to different groups of users. The Scopus similarity network (Figure 4b) has one user, who is connected
to nearly all other users. Aside from this, the network does not have other specific peculiarities. In Figure
4c the hybrid similarity network for selected users is presented. In this network we still can find the hub
users, but now they are located closer to each other and have several interconnections. The shape of the
large users group is shifted towards the hub users. This example shows that hybrid similarity networks
can show connections, which cannot be obtained using only one of the networks.

5 Conclusion and future works
In this paper we analyzed two leading scientific platforms – ResearchGate and Scopus – in order to
understand, what features of users reflect and influence the research collaboration within these networks.
Using these features we developed an approach for building scientific similarity measures of scientists
for each site and combined these measures to build the hybrid network, which indirectly takes into
account all features of the source networks. Experimental analysis showed that the resulting network is
able to generate interconnections between users, which cannot be obtained with the use of only one
network.
In our future works we are going to address the issues, which were discovered during the first stage
of the research. Among them are problems with the matching users between the networks – we shall
include in this process not only the name of the author, but his or her publications and the institution.
Another direction for the improvement is an adjustment of contribution of various parameters into the
unified measure – now all features are normalized and thus can make equal impact to the final value,
but such approach is not always valid.
