Abstract. In this paper we present a Korean part-of-speech tagging system
using resolution rules for individual ambiguous word. Our system resolves
lexical ambiguities by common rules, rules for individual ambiguous word, and
statistical approach. We built resolution rules for each word which has several
distinct morphological analysis results with a view to enhancing tagging
accuracy. Statistical approach based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is
applied for ambiguous words that are not resolved by the rules. The experiment
on the test set shows that the part-of-speech tagging system has high accuracy
and broad coverage.
Keywords: Part-of-Speech, Tagging, Resolution Rules.

1 Introduction
Morphological analyzer is the basic module for most natural language processing
systems such as natural language understanding, information retrieval, and machine
translation. Morphological analyzer analyzes all possible combination of morphemes
for a given word and generates one or more analysis results for that word. In general
about 30% of Korean words have two or more analysis results. Resolving these
ambiguities is thus vital to build reliable natural language processing system. Part-ofspeech tagging is the module to resolve such morphological ambiguities.
Conventional part-of-speech tagging approaches are classified into statistical
approach[1], rule-based approach[2], and hybrid approach [3].
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) has been the mainstay of the statistical model for
part-of-speech tagging. It selects a sequence of part-of-speech tags with the highest
probability from words or morphemes around an ambiguous word. Rule-based
approach resolves ambiguities by predefined rules. Its major advantage is high
accuracy but unlike statistical approach it has narrow coverage. Therefore pure rulebased approach is scarcely used in resolving morphological ambiguities. Hybrid

approach uses both rules and statistical information with a view to achieving high
accuracy and broad coverage. Most Korean part-of-speech tagging systems adopt this
approach.
This paper presents a part-of-speech tagging system for Korean. The system uses
resolution rules for individual ambiguous words to get high accuracy. Each rule has
syntax and semantic information for an ambiguous word and words around it. Our
system applies common rules to test set followed by resolution rules and statistical
tagging.

2 Building Information for Disambiguation
2.1 Common-Rules

할 수 있다
하지 않을 수

Common-rules are ones for idioms and phrases of common use such as “~
(cannot)”(halq swu epsta), “~
(can)”(halq swu issta), “~
(must)”(haci anh.ul swu epsta). In the first stage common-rules are applied to
resolve ambiguities of words. For example the tags of “ ”(swu) in above expressions
are determined as an incomplete noun.

2.2 Resolution Rules for Individual Ambiguous Word
In this study, “an ambiguous word” is a word that has two or more distinct
morphological analysis results. Ambiguous words was collected and the rules for each
ambiguous word was built from a large corpus. 330 ambiguous words which amount to
50% of total ambiguous words were chosen. Morphemes, part-of-speech tags, word
senses, positions, and/or other information of each ambiguous word and words around it
were encoded into rules to resolve the ambiguous word. Some rules are shown in Fig.1.

2.3 Statistical Information
Information on tag sequences and a word itself were extracted from the tagged
corpus. The unit of 3 words information was also extracted. Table 1 shows an
example of statistical information extracted in this manner.

3 Experiment
For evaluation, ETRI corpus and Sejong corpus were used for the experiment with
sentences. Table 2 shows the information of the test corpus. The rate of ambiguity in
the table means the average number of morphological analysis results of ambiguous
words. First, we apply common rules to an ambiguous word. Rules for individual
ambiguous words are applied subsequently when the ambiguity is not resolved. First
matching rule is applied to an ambiguous word when the conditions of two or more
rules are satisfied. Statistical information is applied finally when the ambiguity is not
resolved. Table 3 shows the result of tagging with the rules only, tagging with only
statistical information, and tagging with both.
In Table 3, the average rate of correctness with rules only is 88.68 and resolution
accuracy by rules is almost 100%; the average rate of correctness with statistical
information is 93.82%. These results are comparable to the best performance of
conventional Korean statistical part-of-speech system.

Table 3 also shows that the average rate of correctness of our system that uses both
rules and statistical information is higher than those of systems that use only rules or
only statistical information. Furthermore, the accuracy of our system is 96.86% which

is higher than any other conventional hybrid tagging systems whose accuracies varies
from 93% to 96%. Our system does not resolve the ambiguities correctly when two or
more consecutive words are all ambiguous.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we described a hybrid Korean part-of-speech tagging system using rules
and statistical information. About 50% of ambiguities are resolved by those rules, and
their accuracy is almost 100%. Statistical tagging based on HMM is applied to words
which are not resolved by rules. The correctness of our system was 95.98%, while
that of statistical tagging only was 93.82%. The system failed to resolve correctly the
ambiguities for consecutive ambiguous words.
