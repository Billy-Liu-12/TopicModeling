Abstract. Present work is concerned with the construction of a latticeBoltzmann (LB) model for ideal miscible fluids. In this particular case,
collision term in LB equation can be modelled by, only, considering mutual and cross collisions between, respectively, particles of the same and
of different kind. A non-linear LB model with three distinct relaxation
times intended to be used in problems with large concentration gradients
is presented. Model enables the independent management of the fluid viscosities µr and µb and binary diffusivity D. It is shown that mass and
momentum are, always, preserved and that the model retrieves consistent
hydrodynamic equations in the incompressible limit. Theoretical values,
obtained from Chapman-Enskog analysis, for binary diffusivity and mixture viscosity are compared with numerical values, directly obtained from
LB simulations.

Introduction

When two fluids r and b are mixed, long-range intermolecular forces will control
the nature of the resulting physical system. When attractive r-r and b-b forces
are dominant with respect to r-b forces, fluids r and b will segregate. In this
case, fluids are said to be immiscible. Mixtures of fluids can be thermodynamically stable when long-range attraction between molecules of different kinds are
dominant. In this second case, fluids are said to be miscible. When long-range
forces are negligeable, the fluids and their mixtures are said to be ideal.
A review on lattice-Boltzmann models (LB) for miscible fluids has been,
recently, given by Sofonea and Sekerka[1]. Most common LB are based on a single
BGK collision term and momentum conservation requires the relaxation times
for the species k to be identical [2],[3],[4]. In this way, simulation is restricted
to fluids with identical viscosity. Sofonea and Sekerka proposed the following
splitting of the collision term,
Ωir =

ρr
ρb
+ rb
r
τ
τ

[Rieq (ρr , u) − Ri ] ,

where, for fluids r and b, ρr , ρb are the densities, the τ ’s are relaxation times,

or τ br = τ r and τ rb = τ b . In this way, Sofonea and Sekerka’s model use two independent relaxation times, replacing the constant relaxation time by a function
of the fractional mass of r and b particles.
In this work, a three-parameter BGK model is presented for ideal miscible
fluids, enabling the independent management of the mass diffusivity and r and
b fluid viscosities.
Although in a different form, a three-parameter model with the same above
features has been, very recently, proposed by Luo and Girimaji[5]. Luo and
Gimaji’s rapid communication was published in the course of present work and,
in spite of the fact that a detailed comparison work is needed considering the
computacional performance of the two models, some comments are given in the
Conclusions section, for clarifying some main differences that could be important.

Model

Considering Ri (X, T ) to be the particles distribution of r-particles in site X
at time T and, similarly, for Bi (X, T ), lattice-Boltzmann equation for kind K
particles, K = R, B, will be written as
Ki (X + ci , T + 1) = Ki (X, T ) + Ωik (R0 , R1 , ..., Rbm , B0 , B1 , ..., Bbm ) ,

(4)

where ci = lattice unitary velocity along direction i, bm = number of lattice
directions and index 0 corresponds to rest particles. Collision operator Ωik , k =
r, b is required to satisfy mass and momentum conservation:

Ωir = 0 ,

for a generic velocity v and k = r, b. In the above equation, as usually, D is
the lattice Euclidean dimension, c = |ci |, br is a free-parameter related to the
distribution of rest particles, b = br + bm . The first term in the r.h.s. of Eq. (8) is
related to the relaxation of r-particles distribution to an equilibrium state given
by r-component density and velocity, considering r-r collisions, only. The second
term considers r-b collisions and is related to the relaxation of r-particles to an
equilibrium state given by density ρr and by a b velocity ub . When component b
is dominant, i.e., when ρb /ρ → 1, collisions r-r are very infrequent and collisions
r-b will impose velocity ub to component r.

Chapman-Enskog Asymptotic Analysis

In the continuum limit, the Knudsen number Kn = h/L → 0, where h is the
length corresponding to a lattice unit and L is a macroscopic length, distribution
Ki (X, T ) is expanded in powers of Kn ,
Ki = Ki0 + Kn Ki1 + ...,

K = R, B; i = 0, 1, ..., bm,

(15)

and the time derivative has an induced decomposition
∂t = ∂0 + Kn ∂1 + ....
Collision term given by Eq. (8) can be expanded around

Macroscopic Equations in the Continuum Limit

Macroscopic equations were found by replacing the distributions Ri1 and Bi1
in the Kn expansion of Eq.(4). Mass conservation equation for the k-species is
obtained by multipying the resulting equation by 1 in the ci -space and by adding
the Kn zero and first order contributions. At first order in Kn , species-r mass
conservation equation was recovered in the following form,
∂t ρr + ∂(ρr uα ) + ∂α (jαr ) = 0 ,

(26)

where the r-species diffusive flux is given by
jαr = −ρD∂α (ω r ) = −ρ(τ m − 1/2)

b m c2
∂α (ω r ) ,

(27)

in lattice units.
In this way, bynary diffusivity depends, only, on the cross relaxation time
and does not depend on the mass fraction of the r and b species. This result is
consistent with Chapman-Enskog resuts, considering the first order c-moments
of Boltzmann continuous equation, when the mass mr = mb [7]. In fact, this
restriction cancels the species diffusive flux dependence on pressure gradients.

For the momentum equation, the lacking of energy conservation in present
model restricts the analysis to the low-velocity, incompressible limit. In this case,
after dropping-out the terms related to ∇ · u, O(u2 ) and O(j · u), ChapmanEnskog analysis leads to
∂t (ρuβ ) + ∂α (P δαβ + ρuα uβ ) = η∂α [ρ(∂α uβ + ∂β uα )] ,

(28)

where P = ρc2s and the kinematic viscosity coefficient η , in lattice units, is given
by
η=

(31)

In this way, in the incompressible limit, Navier-Stokes equation is correctly
retrieved in this LB approximation. Mixture viscosity appears as a function of
the three parameters, τ r , τ b , τ m and the mass fractions, ρr , ρb . When ρb → 0,

which is the correct expression for the kinematic viscosity of pure component r.

Comparison between Theoretical Predictions and
Simulation Results

Theoretical predictions Eqs.(27) and (29) were compared with simulation results.
Simulated diffusivity values, shown in Table 1, were obtained using the transient
method presented in Flekoy [8]. Simulation was performed using a 200 x 100 x
3, D3Q19 lattice, with a 10 particles/site for the particle density. Viscosity was
obtained in a 400 x 20 x 3 lattice from the velocity profiles of a plane Poiseuille
flow[9].
There is a very good agreement between theoretical predictions and simulation results even for markedely different relaxation times, although, as it was to
be expected, large values of τ and/or large differences in viscosity can, substantially, increase the simulation running time.

Conclusion

Intended to be used in diffusion-problems with large concentration gradients, in
presently proposed model, relaxation times are non-linear functions of the r and

with the same features of the model given by Eqs (8), (9). In this way, it preserves mass and momentum in collisions and gives a consistent hydrodynamics.
Nevertheless, the use of constant relaxation times leads to constant mixture viscosity and this appear to be, only, realistic when concentration gradients are
small. In present notation, Luo and Gimaji’s model [5] can be written as

Although the authors did not report their mixture viscosity, the use of a
constant relaxation time for r-r collisions appear to be unrealistic when concentration gradients are important. In addition, contribution of r-b collisions to
Ri distribution is considered in Luo and Gimaji’s model to be, only, proportional to the first-order non equilibrium term (ur − ub ). This difference should
reveals to be unimportant, considering the low-velocity limitations of both models. Nevertheless, as commented in the Introduction of present paper, a more
detailed comparative analysis is needed, focusing, specially, the computational
performance.
