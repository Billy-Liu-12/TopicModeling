Professor Krzysztof Cetnarowicz was a well-known scholar in the field of decentralized and
agent-based systems. He introduced several new ideas, mixing the mathematical precision with
his imagination to explore new fields of computer sciences. One of his best-known ideas, was the
idea of M-agent [1, 2], a deliberative kind of agent that perceives the events in the environment,
builds its model of the environment, prepares appropriate strategies and acts according to those,
affecting the environment. His last monograph published in 2012 was dedicated to this idea [3].
Applications of M-agents include simulations and optimization of transport networks, task
allocations, industrial planning, service-oriented architectures, as well as route planning for
mobile robots. Another idea of Professor Cetnarowicz was his idea of Evolutionary MultiAgent System (EMAS) proposed in 1996. This computing paradigm coupling evolutionary and
agent-based approaches was used by a community of his colleagues and students. The idea
of EMAS consists of treating the evolutionary individual as an agent, an autonomous being,
perceiving the environment, interacting with other agents (carrying the solutions) and working
towards the solution. One of the remarkable mechanisms of EMAS is the distributed selection.
It becomes more related to the biological one than the selection in the classical Evolutionary
Algorithms. Namely, the agents possess a certain amount of allocated resource, called the
energy. They exchange this energy during meetings, when the energy flows from the worse
agents to the better ones. Now, when the energy of some agent exceeds a certain level, it may
reproduce with another agent, creating an offspring as a combination of their solutions, and
passing to the offspring enough energy to begin its life in the same conditions as the parents
did.
The introduction of the EMAS methodology resulted in four Ph.D. thesis, two D.Sc. habilitations, dozens of publications and M.Sc. theses, as well as it generated dedicated software
platforms implemented in languages like Java, Scala, Erlang or Python. Finally, a dedicated
formal model was prepared based on the Markov Chains and the theory of Michael Vose. The
EMAS may be perceived as one of the first memetic algorithms, following the works of Pablo
Moscato, as it consists of individuals that exchange certain knowledge, and use it individually when pursuing their goals of searching for the optimum of the fitness function. Professor
Krzysztof Cetnarowicz was a visiting professor at the Technical University of Belfort Montbeliard (France). He has been a member of the PCs of over 20 conferences, a reviewer of grants
at the National Czech Agency of the Czech Republic, Polish National Science Centre grants,
and a member of the diploma examination board at the University of Ostrava VSB (Czech
Republic) and a member of the Scientific Board of Institute of Computer Science on Polish
Academy of Science (IPI PAN). He published over one hundred scientific works, printed as
conference proceedings, journal articles, monographs, and patents. He worked as a reviewer at
many research projects, articles, Ph.D. and D.Sc. theses. In the recent years, he led Intelligent
Information Systems Group working at the Department of Computer Science, AGH University
of Science and Technology. He was always kind and helpful, very cordial and supportive to all
of his colleagues and students.
