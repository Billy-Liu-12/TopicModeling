Abstract
The study of risk aversion of an agent confronted by a risk situations with several parameters is an important topic of risk theory.
It is tackled traditionally with probabilistic methods. When these do not offer an appropriate shaping we can use Zadeh’s
possibility theory . In this paper a possibilistic model of risk aversion with several parameters is proposed. The notion of
possibilistic risk premium vector is introduced as a measure of an agent’s risk aversion to a situation with several risk parameters.
The main result of the paper is an approximate calculation formula of this indicator. The way we can apply this model in risk
aversion evaluation in grid computing is sketched out.

Keywords: Fuzzy number; possibilistic risk aversion; possibilistic risk premium vector

1. Introduction
In economic and financial activity risk situations with several parameters often appear. An agent’s risk aversion
to such situations is a topic which concerned several authors [9], [16], [17], [19], etc. They tackled this topic by
probabilistic methods. The risk situation with several parameters is represented by a random vector, and the agent’s
attitude to risk is represented by a multidimensional utility function.
In [9] the notion of risk premium vector was introduced as a measure of multidimensional risk aversion. It
generalizes the notion of risk premium studied by Arrow [1] and Pratt [21] for unidimensional risk.
Probability theory can describe appropriately only those situations of uncertainty for which the events occur with
a big frequency and for which we have large databases. For other phenomena of uncertainty possibility theory
initiated by Zadeh in [25] and developed mainly by Dubois and Prade [7], [8] is preferred.
Possibilistic models were successfully applied in decision making problems in conditions of uncertainty, fuzzy
neural networks, fuzzy cooperative games, portfolio problem, etc. (see [3], [8], [12], [20]).
In [13], [15] two possibilistic models of unidimensional risk aversion have been proposed. The study of
multidimensional risk aversion by possibilistic methods has been started in [14] by defining a notion of possibilistic
risk premium and by proving an approximate calculation formula.
The transition from probabilistic models to possibilistic models has two main components: random variables are
replaced with fuzzy variables and probabilistic indicators (expected value, variance, covariance, etc.) are replaced

with possibilistic indicators. To define possibilistic risk premium the notion of possibilistic expected utility had to be
first introduced (see [13]-[15]).
This paper treats multidimensional possibilistic risk aversion from a more general perspective, similar to that of
[9]. Fuzzy numbers are the most important class of possibilistic distributions. They are often chosen to represent
situations of uncertainty. In our case risk parameters will be represented by fuzzy numbers. The main concept of the
paper is possibilistic risk premium vector associated with a possibilistic vector, a weighting function and a
multidimensional utility function. This indicator measure the aversion of an agent in front of a risk situation with
several parameters. For the particular case when all components of this vector are equal, the notion of possibilistic
risk premium of [14] is found.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 recalls the definition of fuzzy numbers and the main indicators
associated with them: expected value, variance and covariance. In Section 3 the notion of multidimensional
possibilistic expected utility by means of -level sets is introduced. By particularization, possibilistic expected value
[2], [11] and some notions of possibilistic variance and covariance [2], [11], [26] are obtained from it. These
indicators will be used in the next section to evaluate multidimensional possibilistic risk premium.
Section 4 develops a model of possibilistic risk aversion with several parameters. The mathematical framework
of this possibilistic model is specified by a possibilistic vector (representing the risk situation), a multidimensional
utility function (representing the attitude of an agent to a risk situation) and a weighting function. Using
multidimensional possibilistic expected utility the notion of possibilistic risk premium vector is defined as a measure
of an agent’s risk aversion to a risk situation with several parameters. The main result of the paper is an approximate
calculation formula of this risk indicator. The formula expresses this indicator in terms of utility function,
possibilistic expected value and possibilistic covariance.
Section 5 contains an application of this model to evaluate risk aversion in grid computing.
2. Possibilistic indicators of fuzzy numbers
In this section we recall the definition of fuzzy number and some of its properties. By [2], [3], [10], [11], [26] we
will present some of the possibilistic indicators associated with fuzzy numbers (expected value, variance,
covariance) needed to formulate definitions and results of multidimensional possibilistic risk aversion theory (see
Section 4).
Let X be a set of states. A fuzzy subset of X (=fuzzy set) is a function A : X  [0,1] . For any x X the
number A (x) is the degree of membership of x to A .
Let A be a fuzzy set in X . A is normal if there exists x X such that A (x) = 1. The support of A is defined by
sup(A) = x X | A(x) > 0 .
In the following we consider that X is the set R of real numbers. For any  [0,1] , the  –level set of a fuzzy
set A in R is defined by

{


[A] = 


}

{ x R | A(x)   }

if

 >0

cl(sup(A))

if

 =0

(cl(sup(A)) is the topological closure of the set sup(A)  R ).
A fuzzy number is a fuzzy set of R normal, fuzzy convex, continuous and with bounded support.

Let A be a fuzzy number and  [0,1] . Then [A] is a closed and convex subset of R. We denote


a1 ( ) = min[A] and a2 ( ) = max[A] . Hence, [A] = [a1 ( ), a2 ( )] for all  [0,1] .
A non–negative and monotone increasing function f :[0,1]  R is a weighting function if it satisfies the
normality condition

We fix a fuzzy number A and a weighting function f. Assume that [A] = [a1 (
The possibilistic expected value of A w.r.t. f was defined in [11], [20] by

E( f , A) =

(a1 ( ) + a2 ( )) f ( )d .

The possibilistic variance of A w.r.t. f is defined by

Var( f , A) =

1 1
[(a1 ( )  E( f , A))2 + (a2 ( )  E( f , A))2 ] f ( )d .
2 0

If f ( ) = 2 for any  [0,1] , then E(f,A ) is the crisp possibilistic mean value introduced in [2], p. 318, and
V ar(f,A ) is the second possibilistic variance defined in [2], p. 324.


Let A ,B be two fuzzy numbers and f a weighting function. Assume that [A]

= [a1 ( ), a2 ( )] and



[B] = [b1 ( ), b2 ( )] for all  [0,1] . The possibilistic covariance Cov(f, A ,B) of A and B w.r.t. f is defined in
[26], p. 261 by

1 1
[(a1 ( )  E( f , A))(b1 ( )  E( f , B)) + (a2 ( )  E( f , A))(b2 ( )  E( f , B))] f ( )d
2 0
If f ( ) = 2 for any  [0,1] , then Cov(f, A ,B) is the second possibilistic covariance defined in [2] p. 324.
A triangular fuzzy number A = (a,  ,  ) is defined by the function A : R  [0,1] :

If = then the triangular fuzzy number A is called symmetric and it is denoted A=(a,).
Recall from [7] that if
hence a1 (

A = (a,  ,  ) then

[A] = [a  (1   ) , a + (1   ) ] for all  [0,1] ,

Assume that

f ( ) = 2 for all  [0,1] . Then E( f , A) = a +

If A = (a,  ) then E ( f , A) = a .
A possibilistic vector has the form (A 1, . . . ,A n) where A 1, . . . ,An are fuzzy numbers.
3. Possibilistic expected utility: the multidimensional case
Probability theory of multidimensional risk aversion is built on the notion of expected utility (by [9]). We



consider a risk situation with n parameters represented by a random vector X = (X1,..., X n ) . If

u : R n  R is a

continuous utility function then u(X1,..., X n ) is a random variable. The expected value E(u(X1,..., X n )) of



u(X1,..., X n ) is called X ’s expected utility w.r.t. u.

We consider a risk situation with n parameters for which a possibilistic modeling is needed (e.g., when we have
few data on risk situation). Then the risk situation will
 be described by a possibilistic vector. By definition, an n–
dimensional possibilistic vector has the form A = (A1,..., An ) where A1,..., An are fuzzy numbers. Then

A1,..., An describe n risk parameters.
To develop a theory of risk aversion corresponding to this case an appropriate notion of possibilistic expected
utility is needed.

f :[0,1]  R be a weighting function and g : R n  R a continuous function.We consider a possibilistic
vector (A1,..., An ) where [A] = [ai ( ), bi ( )] for any i = 1, . . . ,n and  [0,1] . We define the possibilistic
Let

expected utility of (A1,..., An ) w.r.t. f and g by

E( f , g(A1,..., An )) =

1 1
[g(a1 ( ),..., an ( )) + g(b1 ( ),..., bn ( ))] f ( )d .
2 0

If n = 1 we obtain the notion of possibilistic expected utility of [13]. For n = 1 and g(x) = x for each x R we
have E(f, g(A )) = E(f,A ).
Remark 3.1 Let n = 2 and g(x, y) = (x  E(f,A1))(y  E(f,A2)) for any x, y R . Then E(f, g(A1,A2)) =
cov(f,A1,A2).
In this section in the following we fix a possibilistic vector (A1, . . . ,An) and a weighting function

f :[0,1]  R . Assume that [Ai ] = [ai ( ), bi ( )] for any  [0,1] .

The following propositions will be used in the next section to prove an approximate calculation formula for the
possibilistic risk premium vector.

g : R n  R, h : R n  R be two continuous functions and a, b R . We consider the
n

4. Multidimensional possibilistic risk aversion
In this section we will introduce the possibilistic risk premium vector as a measure of risk aversion of an agent to
a possibilistic risk situation with several parameters. Then we prove an approximate calculation formula of this
indicator.
We recall first some elements of multidimensional probabilistic risk aversion [9], [16], [17], [19], etc. They will
be the inspiring source for the notions and results on multidimensional possibilistic risk aversion from this section.
The setting in which probability theory of multidimensional risk aversion is developed has two components:

From [9] we recall the notion of risk premium vector.
Definition 4.1 A risk premium vector


 
 ( X, u) = ( 1,..., n ) (associated with the random vector X and the

utility function u) is defined as a solution of the equation:
(1) E(u(X1,..., X n )) = u(E(X1 )  1,..., E(X n )  n )

.
By [9] equation (1) can have several solutions ( 1,..., n ) .

We denote ei = E(Xi ) for i= 1, . . . ,n.

Proposition 4.2 [9] An approximate solution of equation (1) is given by

To build a possibility theory of multidimensional risk aversion we consider a setting with the following components:
• a weighting function f :[0,1]  R;
• a possibilistic vector


A = (A1,..., An );

• an n–dimensional utility function u : R n  R


The possibilistic vector A models the risk situation and the utility function u describes the agent’s attitude to A .
We introduce now the notion of possibilistic risk premium vector.
Definition 4.3 A possibilistic risk premium vector




 ( A, f , u) = ( 1,..., n ) (associated with the possibilistic

vector A , the weighting function f and the utility function u) is defined as a solution of the equation
(3) E( f , u(A1,..., An )) = u(E( f , A1 )  1,..., E( f , An )  pn ) .

E( f , u(A1,..., An )) is the possibilistic expected utility introduced in the previous section.
Definition 4.3 can be confronted with Definition 4.1. The utility function u appears in both definitions, but the
probabilistic expected value (resp. probabilistic expected utility) of Definition 4.1 was replaced by possibilistic
expected value (resp. possibilistic expected utility).

Equation (3) does not have a unique solution  = ( 1,..., n ) .
A possibilistic risk premium vector


 = ( 1,..., n ) is an indicator of risk aversion of the agent represented by

u. Equality (3) expresses that agent u is willing to pay the amount 1 ,...,  n to realize the possibilistic expected utility
E ( f , u ( A1 ,..., An )) .
In [14] a notion of possibilistic risk premium was defined as follows.

Definition 4.4 A possibilistic risk premium  =  ( A, f , u) (associated with

premium vector associated with A , f and u.
Remark 4.5 In equations (3) and (4) assume that E( f , u(A1,..., An )) is finite.

Remark 4.6 (4) is an equation in  and it can have several solutions. To see it let us consider the bidimensional
possibilistic vector (A 1, A 2) and a utility function u(x 1, x 2) = x 1x 2. Then equation (4) becomes
( E ( f , A1 )   )( E ( f , A2 )   ) = E ( f , u ( A1 , A2 ))

Taking

f ( ) = 2 for  [0,1] and A1 = (r1, 1 ), A2 = (r2 ,  2 ) we have E( f , A1 ) = r1, E( f , A2 ) = r2 and
1



E ( f , u ( A1 , A2 )) = [( r1  (1   ) 1 )(r2  (1   ) 2 ) + (r1 + (1   ) 1 )( r2 + (1   ) 2 )]d
0

Then equation (4) takes the form (r1   )(r2   ) = E ( f , u ( A1 , A2 )) and we can determine distinct solutions.
In the unidimensional case if the utility function u : R n  R is injective then the solution of (4) is unique.

We denote mi = E( f , Ai ), i = 1,..., n and m = (m1,..., mn ) .

5. Possibilistic risk aversion in grid computing
Grid computing techniques present a lot of interest for commercial applications [6]. In the management of a grid,
risk phenomena with several parameters related to the functioning of grid’s nodes might appear. The study of risk
aversion w.r.t.the functioning of the grid leads to the choice of a multidimensional model. Next we propose a model
based on the topic developed in the previous section.
We consider a grid composed of n nodes N 1, . . . ,N n. Assume that the risk situation generated by node N i is
described by the fuzzy number A i. The possibilistic vector (A1, . . . ,An) will represent the functioning of the grid
overall (regarding the risk situation). The way nodes N i, N j are interrelated is given by Cov(f,A i,A j) where f is a
conveniently chosen weighting function.
n
An agent’s attitude to the risk situation of the grid is expressed by the utility function u : R  R .
In this context possibilistic risk premium vector evaluates the agent’s risk aversion to risk situation (A1, . . . , An)
. The approximate calculation of this indicator is done by the formula of Proposition 4.7.
Example 5.1 Consider a grid composed of n nodes N 1, . . . ,N n. The risk situation of node N i is described by the
triangular fuzzy number Ai = (ai ,  i , i ) :

Assume that the weighting function
by

f :[0,1]  R and the utility function u : R n  R are defined

f ( ) = 2 for  [0,1] and u(x1,..., xn ) = e 2( x1 +...+xn ) for any (x1,..., xn ) R n .
Notice that u has the class C 2 and is strictly increasing in each argument. A simple calculation shows that for

any (x1,..., xn ) R and
n

i, j = 1,..., n we have

ui (x1,..., xn ) = 2e 2( x1 +...+xn )
uij (x1,..., xn ) = 4e 2( x1 +...+xn )
and therefore

uij (x1,..., xn )
= 2 .
ui (x1,..., xn )

Then by Proposition 4.7 an approximate value of possibilistic risk premium vector associated with this possibilistic
context of risk is given by

6. Conclusions
In this paper a possibilistic model of risk aversion of an agent confronted by a risk situation with several
parameters has been proposed.
The main contributions of the paper are:
- the study of a notion of possibilistic expected utility associated with a possibilistic vector whose components
are fuzzy numbers;
- the definition and the approximate calculation of possibilistic risk premium vector and possibilistic risk
premium associated with a possibilistic vector and an n-dimensional utility function;
- the sketch of a possible application of this model in the evaluation of risk aversion which can appear in the
functioning of a grid.
The mentioned results are a first step to the study of possibilistic risk aversion with several parameters. We
mention the following problems which can be the object of future investigations:
- to obtain a Pratt type theorem to compare the risk aversion of two agents to a risk situations with several
parameters;
- to compare multidimensional risk situations (possibilistic versions of Diamond- Stieglitz theory);
- applications in the analysis of portfolio problem (including experimental results);
- the treatment of risk aversion with mixed parameters (some described by random variables, some described
by fuzzy numbers) .
