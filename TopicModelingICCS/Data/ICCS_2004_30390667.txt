Abstract. Improved splitting method based on stabilizing correction scheme is
used for solving shallow water equations. Recently introduced by Douglas et al.
technique is applied to reduce splitting errors. Accuracy and stability analysis
showed that the developed scheme allows to chose extended time steps and is
more accurate as compared with standard splitting method. The results of
numerical experiments confirmed that presented scheme has almost the same
computational efficiency as primitive stabilizing correction method and it
continues to be accurate and stable for extended time steps up to 1 hour when
primitive method fails.

1 Introduction
For a given spatial resolution, the maximum allowable time step for systems with
multiple time scales is primarily determined by the fastest processes treated explicitly
in numerical scheme. In the large scale atmospheric models the main part of flow
energy is in advective motions, which are much slower than the gravitational wave
speeds present in the system. Since overall accuracy of numerical solution is mainly
defined by approximation of slow modes, the use of explicit schemes in numerical
weather prediction models is not justifiable: in such schemes the time step needed for
stable integration of the high-frequency motions is more than 10 times as small as the
value required by accuracy and stability conditions of the principal low-frequency
modes. As a mere fact, explicit time integration has no been used in the last 20 years
in the majority of atmospheric centers.
Semi-implicit time differencing is an attractive alternative for atmospheric
modeling because the terms responsible for the fastest waves appear in linear form in
the primitive (hydrostatic or shallow water) equations. In fact, the semi-implicit
Eulerian and semi-Lagrangian methods are the most popular techniques used in
numerical weather prediction and simulation of the atmospheric processes of different
space and time scales: from general circulation and climate models to regional and
mesoscale modeling and numerical weather prediction [9, 17]. In the last two decades
a semi-Lagrangian treatment of advection was shown to be more efficient because it
allows to overcome the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition with respect to
advection at the low cost of solving a set of trajectory equations. Semi-Lagrangian
semi-implicit methods are used in the majority of actual research and operational
atmospheric models [6, 9, 11, 14, 15, 16, 17].

The implicit terms of unsplit semi-implicit models require solution of 2D or 3D
linear elliptic equations that is a computationally expensive task. To circumvent this
problem, some time splitting techniques have been applied to atmospheric models [2,
3, 5, 10, 12, 18]. Splitting methods allow to decouple multi-dimensional elliptic
equations into a set of 1D problems, which are solved very efficiently by direct
Gelfand-Thomas algorithm. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, all reports
on application of splitting techniques in atmospheric models indicate the fast grow of
splitting truncation error when time step exceeds CFL advection criterion [2, 3, 4, 13,
18, 19]. To reduce the splitting errors, Douglas et al. recently have proposed small
modifications to splitting construction in the case of parabolic equations [7, 8]. In this
study we apply the last technique to semi-Lagrangian stabilizing correction (SLSC)
scheme for shallow water equations, analyze stability and accuracy properties of the
obtained scheme and present the results of numerical tests.

2 SC Scheme for Linearized Shallow Water Equations
Shallow water equations linearized about a state of rest can be written in the form:

(

)

∂ t u = fv − ∂ xΦ , ∂ t v = − fu − ∂ yΦ , ∂ tΦ = −c 2 ∂ x u + ∂ y v .

(1)

The equations are presented in rotating reference system using Cartesian spatial
coordinates x, y , time coordinate t and common denotations for unknown functions
and parameters: u and v are velocity components, Φ = gz is the geopotential, g is

the gravitational acceleration, z is the height of pressure surface, c 2 = Φ 0 ( Φ 0 is a
mean value of the geopotential), f = 2Ωsinϕ is the Coriolis parameter, Ω is the
modulus of angular velocity of earth's rotation. In system (1) we assume f = const .
The semi-discrete form of a single time step of considered SC scheme applied to
(1) can be written as follows:
uˆ − u

τ

= fv − ∂ xΦ ,

vˆ − v

Here τ is the time step, n is the step number, ϕ ( ϕ = u , v, Φ ) denotes the values at
the “current” time level nτ , ϕˆ , ϕ~, ϕ τ denote the values at the “new” time level

(n + 1)τ . By eliminating the intermediate functions, one can reduce system (2)-(4) to

Here d x , d y are the traces of partial derivative operators and λ is the amplification
factor. Obviously, all roots of equation (7) are on the unit circle iff

τ2f 2 ≤ 4 ,

(8)

which is the linear stability criterion for scheme (2)-(4) and its spatial discretizations.
This is very lenient restriction because f max ≈ 1.4 ⋅10 −4 sec −1 .

3 Improved SC Scheme for Full Shallow Water Equations
The full shallow water equations have a form

(

)

d t u = fv − ∂ xΦ , d t v = − fu − ∂ yΦ , d t Φ = −Φ ∂ x u + ∂ y v ,

(9)

where d t is a symbol of the substantive derivative operator.
One of the principal difficulties in applying the splitting methods to atmospheric
models is the fast growth of truncation errors due to operator splitting when time step
increases. Reports on computational experiments with different splitting techniques
show that the overall solution errors become to be unacceptable when time step
exceeds 30-40 min, although the stability criterion allows using time steps up to 1.5-2
hours or the scheme is even absolutely stable [2, 3, 4, 13, 18, 19]. One of the recent
approaches to reduce these splitting errors was proposed by Douglas et al [7, 8] for
parabolic equations. Applying a similar idea to approximation of equations (9) along
with efficient semi-Lagrangian treatment of advection, we obtain the following
modified SLSC scheme:

In (11), (12) we use constant divergence coefficient, which simplifies solving the
implicit equations and has no effect on practical stability and accuracy if geopotential
deviations from the mean value are sufficiently small. Hereinafter all the values are
located at the points of the particle trajectories calculated at each time step by the
formulas d t x = u , d t y = v . Namely, ϕ denotes the values at the departure points of
the 2D trajectories at “current” time level nτ , ϕ −τ denotes the values at “double
departure” points at the “old” time level (n − 1)τ , ϕˆ , ϕ~, ϕ τ denote the values at the

arrival points of the trajectories at “new” time level (n + 1)τ . Arrival points are
chosen to be the nodes of a uniform spatial grid and the departure points are
calculated by fixed point iterations (which is usually applied algorithm) with a
sufficient condition of convergence given in the form [17]:

(

)

τ ≤ 1 Vd , Vd = max u x , u y , v x , v y .

(13)

For spatial grid with meshsize h ≈ 50km we have V d ≈ 1.6 ⋅10 −4 s −1 and the
maximum allowable time step is τ ≈ 100 min . Analysis of the linear stability of
scheme (10)-(12) reveals that besides (13) there is a counterpart of (8) to be satisfied:
τ 2 f 2 ≤ 2 . However, the last inequality admits time step up to τ ≈ 170 min , which is
a less restrictive than (13), and therefore it does not cause any inconvenience.
Note that if bracketed expression in (10) is omitted we obtain standard SC scheme,
which is analogous to (2)-(4), but with semi-Lagrangian approximation of advective
terms. This scheme has to satisfy the same condition (13).

4 Numerical Experiments
In Table 1 we present the results of comparison of 24-h geopotential height forecasts
produced by standard (SLSC) and modified (MSLSC) schemes with "exact" forecasts
obtained by using leap-frog scheme. The spatial domain Q of 5000x5000 km 2
centered at Porto Alegre city ( 30 0 S , 52 0 W ) was covered by uniform spatial grid. To
reveal an influence of a spatial resolution, two grids with meshsizes of 100 km and 50
km were used. The initial and boundary value conditions for geopotential and wind
components on the 500hPa pressure surface were obtained from objective analysis
and global forecasts of National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). To
define the splitting errors of SLSC and MSLSC schemes as functions of time step,
numerical integrations were performed for τ = 10, 20,40, 60 min . Note that
computations using leap-frog scheme were carried out with time step τ = 1 min
(maximum allowable time step for meshsize h = 50 km ). Evidently, some initial error
is inherent to this comparison, that is, even if τ approaches 0, the differences

between two forecasts do not vanish because of different spatial truncation errors for
semi-Lagrangian and leap-frog methods. However, this error is quite small (less than
2 meters) and has no influence on comparison of the schemes. The results in Table 1
clearly show an advantage of modified scheme for time steps exceeding 30 min and
comparison between 100-km and 50-km results confirms that principal part of
truncation error consists of additional time splitting error for extended time steps.

τ is the time step used for integrations (in minutes); h is the meshsize of spatial grid (in
kilometers); the shown numbers are root-mean-square height differences between 24-h

In the following series of experiments, ten 24-h forecasts were calculated using
leap-frog, SLSC and MSLSC schemes with 1-min, 40-min and 60-min time steps,
respectively. The same 50-km spatial grid and the same initial and boundary
conditions were used. To evaluate a quality of geopotential forecastings, two common
used mean scores were calculated: the root-mean-square differences between 24-h
forecasts and NCEP analysis and the correlation coefficient between observed and
forecast changes [1]. The results of these estimations presented in Table 2 show good
level of accuracy and efficiency of MSLSC scheme. Overall values of these measures
of forecast skill are quite characteristic for shallow water model [1].

Finally, extended in time 120-h forecasts were performed with SLSC and MSLSC
models using 40-min and 60-min time steps, respectively. Both integrations were
stable, but forecast accuracy was lost after 72 hours of calculations. All computations
were carried out on a DEC 3000 computer.
