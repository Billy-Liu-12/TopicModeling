Abstract
A fourth order transport model is proposed for global computation with the application of multi-moment constrained ﬁnite volume (MCV) scheme and Yin-Yang overset grid. Using multi-moment concept, local degrees of
freedom (DOFs) are point-wisely deﬁned within each mesh element to build a cubic spatial reconstruction. The
updating formulations for local DOFs are derived by adopting multi moments as constraint conditions, including
volume-integrated average (VIA), point value (PV) and ﬁrst order derivative value (DV). Using Yin-Yang grid eliminates the polar singularities and results in a quasi-uniform mesh over the whole globe. Each component of Yin-Yang
grid is a part of the LAT-LON grid, an orthogonal structured grid, where the MCV formulations designed for Cartesian
grid can be applied straightforwardly to develop the high order numerical schemes. Proposed MCV model is checked
by widely used benchmark tests. The numerical results show that the present model has fourth order accuracy and is
competitive to most existing ones.

1. Introduction
Since 1990s, high-resolution GCM (General Circulation Model) simulations have become technically possible
with the rapid development of computer hardware. To develop the high performance global models for such kind
of simulations, researchers began to pay more attentions to computational meshes with global quasi-uniform grid
spacing. So far, the representative advanced spherical meshes include cubed-sphere grid [1], icosahedral-triangular
grid, icosahedral-hexagonal grid [2, 3] and Yin-Yang grid [4].
Cubed-sphere grid is constructed by projecting an inscribed cube onto the sphere. It covers the whole global with
six identical patches, where the curvilinear coordinates are constructed. Cubed-sphere grid eliminates the equation

singularities and circumvents the convergence of meridian lines near two poles. Its major disadvantage compared
with LAT-LON grid is that the coordinate system might be non-orthogonal and then results in more complicated
numerical formulations. Furthermore, the discontinuous local coordinates along patches boundaries often introduce
extra numerical errors. Conformal cubic grid was proposed in [5] to obtain the continuous local coordinates at patch
boundaries, but at the cost of losing analytical transformation relations. Global quasi-uniform meshes could also be
constructed by projecting the icosahedron onto the sphere and the resulted grids possess considerably uniform grid
spacing. Two kinds of grids, i.e. icosahedral-triangular grid and icosahedral-hexagonal grid, have been becoming
popular in GCM community recently. However, these spherical grids are unstructured in nature. The numerical
models on these unstructured meshes require numerical techniques which are very diﬀerent from those developed
for the structured grids and are much more complicated. Generally, the numerical models running on unstructured
grids are usually more computational expensive and more challenging for parallel implementations. Meanwhile, it is
usually not a trivial work to develop high order schemes (more than second order accuracy) over an unstructured grid.
Yin-Yang grid (shown in Fig.1) was recently introduced by [4]. Being an overset grid, Yin-Yang grid is constructed
by combining two perpendicularly oriented LAT-LON grid components of low latitude part, which is quasi-uniform
and free from the polar singularity. Since each component of Yin-Yang is part of the conventional LAT-LON grid, it
is very attractive for GCM modelers. It provides a convenient platform to directly transplant the existing numerical
models developed on the latitude-longitude grid. Being an overset grid, Yin-Yang grid needs to communicate data
in the overlapping area between Yin and Yang components which does not automatically guarantee the total mass
conservation over the sphere, though conservative schemes are adopted within two component grids. A transport
model was proposed in [6] to assure the global conservation on Yin-Yang grid by adjusting the ﬂux computation for
the cells in the overlapping area based on a piecewise constant reconstruction. The scheme adopted in [7] for high
order mass integration over spherical polygons might be a potential choice for higher order implementations.
We have shown in our previous work [8] that numerical errors, including those in in mass conservation, can
be remarkably reduced by implementing high order local reconstructions using multi-moments. In this paper, we
concentrate on developing a fourth order accurate atmospheric transport model for the Yin-Yang grid by using high
order MCV scheme. The numerical results show that the resulting model assures adequate accuracy for medium range
weather prediction or short range climate simulation.
Multi moment constrained ﬁnite volume (MCV) scheme was proposed in [9]. This scheme introduced a novel
numerical framework for developing the arbitrary high order schemes. Instead of using multi moments as model
variables directly, degrees of freedom (DOFs) for high order reconstruction are locally deﬁned as point-wise values
at speciﬁed points within each cell. Multi moments (constraints) including volume-integrated average (VIA), point
values (PVs) and derivatives of diﬀerent orders (DVs) are adopted to provide the spatial discretization formulations for
local DOFs. Third to sixth order MCV schemes for system of conservation laws have been constructed on Cartesian
grid in [9]. The MCV schemes are computational eﬃcient due to concise evolution equations for diﬀerent moments.
Furthermore, MCV schemes allows larger CFL stability conditions compared with discontinuous Galerkin schemes
and spectral volume/diﬀerence schemes of same order. As we know, smooth but considerably complex structures are
main characteristic of geophysical ﬂows. To accurately simulate such phenomena, high order scheme are preferred.
We have developed a global shallow water model based on Yin-Yang grid in [8] using conservative semi-Lagrangian
scheme. Though semi-Lagrangian schemes are wildly used in GCMs, it is not easy to treat the integration of source
terms along the trajectory with uniform high order accuracy. For general systems of conservation laws, we prefer to
adopt the high order schemes developed under Eulerian framework. In this paper, we develop a global transport model
by extending the fourth order MCV scheme to spherical geometry with the application to Yin-Yang grid.
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. We describe the fourth order MCV formulations for
solving transport equation on Yin-yang grid in section 2. Section 3 includes the numerical results of wildly used
benchmark tests by proposed model and the comparisons with other representative global transport models for veriﬁcation. At last, a short conclusion is given in section 4.
2. Spherical transport model on the Yin-Yang grid
2.1. Yin-Yang overset grid
The Yin-Yang overset grid consists of two components. Each one is nothing but the lower latitude part of the
conventional LAT-LON grid. As a result, the grid spacing of the Yin-Yang grid is quite uniform. To cover the whole

(right), perpendicularly oriented to each other. Each component grid covers a domain of longitudinal 270 degrees and latitudinal 90 degrees.

global, the computational domain (Yin- or Yang grid) is at least deﬁned to be from 45◦ S to 45◦ N in latitudinal direction
and from 45◦ E to 315◦ E in longitudinal direction. Two components of Yin-Yang grid are normal to each other, the
transformation laws between Yin coordinate (λ , ϕ ) and Yang coordinate (λ, ϕ) is easily written as

Bearing in mind that the Yin and Yang components are identical, the same numerical formulations can be independently used on Yin or Yang component if the enough ghost cells are interpolated from the adjacent component. The
locations of ghost cells are calculated and stored at the beginning of the computation. MCV scheme is constructed
based on single-cell reconstructions. As a result, only one-layer ghost cells are required to exchange the information
over Yin and Yang components. Using local high-order reconstructions, interpolation stencil used for evaluating the
ghost cell is within one computational element. Such compact stencil is useful not only for improving computational
eﬃciency, but also suppressing the extra numerical errors generated by nonconforming connections between Yin and
Yang components. For sake of brevity, we specify our discussions in the following sections only to the Yang grid.
2.2. Fourth order MCV transport model on Yin-Yang grid
In this subsection, we describe the numerical formulations of fourth order MCV model for global transport computation on Yin-Yang grid.
Two dimensional spherical transport equation is written on the LAT-LON grid in conservative form as
(2)
∂t ψ + ∂λ e + ∂ϕ f = 0,
√

where ψ = Gφ, φ is the transported ﬁeld, G = a2 cos ϕ is the Jacobian of transformation, a is the Earth radius, λ and
u
v
ϕ denote the longitude and latitude direction on sphere, ﬂux vector f = (e, f ) = (ψ˜u, ψ˜v), and v˜ = (˜u, v˜ ) = ( a cos
ϕ , a ) is
the angular velocity on LAT-LON grid.
Third order spatial reconstruction over each control volume is required to construct fourth order MCV model. As
a result, 16 local DOFs should be deﬁned within each control volume for single-cell reconstruction. As shown in
computational space in Fig.2, 16 local DOFs (φi jmn where the local DOF indices m (1 to 4) and n (1 to 4) indicate
the positions within the control volume of the indices i j ) are equidistantly arranged in logical rectangular control
volume Ci j . The discretization formulations for these local DOFs through constraint conditions provided by multi
moments were developed in [9] as so-called multi-moment ﬁnite volume (MCV) scheme. We hereafter describe the
implementation of fourth order MCV scheme for global transport computation on Yin-Yang overset grid.
To construct a high order model, derivatives of ﬂux vectors (second and third terms of Eq. (2)) are ﬁrstly computed
through MCV scheme to obtain the semi-discrete equations. Then the time integration is accomplished by using fourth
order Runge-Kutta scheme.

Figure 2: The equidistant local DOFs are deﬁned within the control volume Ci j = [λi−1/2 , λi+1/2 ]×[ϕ j−1/2 , ϕ j+1/2 ] where 16 local DOFs are denoted
as the blank circles for the fourth-order MCV model. There are four rows (grid lines) in λ-direction and four columns (grid lines) in ϕ-direction
within the control volume, respectively.

On structured grid, MCV scheme are eﬃciently implemented by using one dimensional formulations in diﬀerent
directions one by one along grid lines. Without losing generality, we consider the determination of the derivative of
ﬂux component e with respect to λ. Similar procedure by exchanging e with f and λ with ϕ can be used along grid
lines in ϕ-direction.
Considering the local DOFs deﬁned along nth (n=1 to 4) row within control volume Ci j (Fig.2), we describe the
numerical procedure to calculate the derivative of ﬂux e with respect to λ. To build an even order MCV scheme,
constraints are deﬁned both at cell’s interfaces and inside the cell. For fourth order scheme, constraints are adopted as
• Point values of ﬂux component e at two endpoints of control volume, i.e. ei j1n and ei j4n , which are used in the
ﬂux-form formulation for the Line-Integrated Average (LIA) moment over the line segment in λ direction;
• First order derivative values of ﬂux component e at two ends of control volume, i.e. (∂λ e)i j1n and (∂λ e)i j4n ,
which are used to update the Point Value (PV) moment;
• Second order derivative value of ﬂux component e at the center of control volume, i.e. ∂2λ e
another constraint in terms of the Derivative (DV) moment.

3. Numerical tests
In this section, we present three widely used numerical examples for global transport to evaluate the numerical
scheme. The convergence rate of the numerical scheme is examined by grid reﬁnement tests for the spherical advection transport problem. The solid body transport test for advection equation proposed by [10] and another recently
suggested moving-vortex test is utilized to examine the performance of the numerical scheme for practical applications. Normalized error measures l1 , l2 and l∞ on the Yin-Yang grid in details are deﬁned in [8].

3.1. Accuracy test
A smooth initial distribution is speciﬁed for accuracy test as
φ(λ, ϕ, 0) = cos ϕ2 sin 2λ.

(13)

Solid rotations in diﬀerent directions are tested with the velocity ﬁeld as
u = u0 (cos ϕ cos α + sin ϕ cos λ sin α)
,
v = −u0 sin λ sin ϕ

(14)

where the parameter α is the angle between the axis of the solid body rotation and the polar axis of the spherical
coordinate system, and u0 = 2πa/(12days)
Normalized errors by present model on a series reﬁning grids are given in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3 for solid
rotations in diﬀerent directions. According to these results, the fourth order accuracy of present model are veriﬁed as
expected.

3.2. Cosine bell advection
Advection of a cosine bell, as the ﬁrst test of Williamson’s benchmark test set [10], is wildly checked to evaluate
global models. The cosine bell is initially speciﬁed as
φ(λ, ϕ) =

0.5[1 + cos(πr/R)]
0

if r < R = a/3
otherwise

(15)

where r = a arccos sin ϕ0 sin ϕ + cos ϕ0 cos ϕ cos (λ − λ0 ) , and the center of the distribution is λ0 = π/2 and ϕ0 = 0.
The driving wind ﬁeld is the same as the accuracy test case. Grid spacing is 4◦ in this case study, which corresponds
◦
to a grid resolution of 43 in terms of DOFs.

1010

Xingliang Li et al. / Procedia Computer Science 9 (2012) 1004 – 1013

Fig.3 shows that the cosine bell returns to its initial position after one revolution (12 days). The numerical contour
lines (dashed lines) are visually identical to the analytic solution (solid lines). The history of normalized errors are
shown in Fig.4 where the ﬂuctuation in the normalized errors is observed when the cosine bell moves across the
overlapping region of the Yin-Yang grid. Table 4 indicates the normalized errors after one revolution of rotation. It is
noted that the normalized errors along the polar direction are larger than the others in Table 4 because in this case the
advection path has more overlapping regions.
Compared with other models developed on LAT-LON grid (SLICE [11]), our result is competitive along the polar
direction. Althrough the smaller CFL number is used against the SLICE scheme, the present model is easy to treat
the source terms with uniform high order accuracy and the polar problems are avoided by utilizing the quasi-uniform
Yin-Yang grid.
Numerical results of fourth order MCV model are better than those results of third order conservative semiLagrangian model [8] with an equivalent spatial resolution, for example, the numerical tests under the 1.40625◦
resolution in [8]. In addition, those are obviously better than [12] with their resolution of 1◦ on the Yin-Yang grid.
The simulation results on the Yin-Yang grid are also competitive to other multi-moment fourth order global models
on the icosahedral grid [13] and on the cubed sphere [14] using similar degree of freedoms.

3.3. Moving vortices
A more practical and challenging advection test is introduced in [15]. A complex velocity ﬁeld is generated by
superposing two vortical deformational ﬂow ﬁelds whose vortex centers move along the trajectory of the solid rotation
ﬂow speciﬁed by Eq. (14). Detailed conﬁguration of this test can be found in [15].
We run this test on grid with a resolution equivalent to 2.5◦ in terms of DOFs. Rotations of the vortex centers
in three diﬀerent directions, corresponding to α = 0, α = π4 and α = π2 , have been carried out. The time evolution
of normalized errors along three diﬀerent direction are depicted in Fig.5. It is observed that the errors are hardly
inﬂuenced by the rotation direction.
As shown in [15], three methods including discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, semi-Lagrangian method and
ﬁnite volume (FV) methed are implemented for evaluating their performance in this moving vortex test . Compared
with semi-Lagrangian method (see their Fig.5 for normalized errors), the normalized errors of the MCV scheme
are obviously better in the case of the equivalent resolution with respect to the conventional LAT-LON sphere. The
present model gives smaller errors in comparison with FV solution on the grid with same resolution (see their Fig.
7 for normalized errors). Although the DG method shows a little smaller normalized errors under the equivalent
resolution, the MCV scheme allows larger CFL number for computational stability in the same order (see table 1
in [9] ) and has a competitive computational eﬃciency since there is not any time-consuming volume integration
involved. Contour plots of transport ﬁeld φ and absolute errors are given in Fig.6 at diﬀerent days. The location of
moving vortex centers and phase of front of deforming vortices are accurately captured.

4. Conclusion
A fourth order transport model on the spherical Yin-Yang grid is presented by using the multi-moment constrained
ﬁnite volume (MCV) scheme. The MCV method uses local DOFs deﬁned within single element at equally spaced
points as the model variables. The evolution formulations for local DOFs are derived by adopting multi moments as
constraint conditions, including volume integrated average (VIA), point value (PV) and spatial derivative value (DV)
in our transport model. In the present model, the polar singularity and the convergence of meridians in the polar
regions of conventional LAT-LON gird is completely avoided through utilizing the quasi-uniform Yin-Yang grid. The
MCV scheme allows less restrictive CFL stability conditions in comparison with discontinuous Galerkin schemes and
spectral volume schemes of same order. The widely used benchmark tests show that the present model has competitive
high-order numerical accuracy and computational eﬃciency compared to most existing models.
