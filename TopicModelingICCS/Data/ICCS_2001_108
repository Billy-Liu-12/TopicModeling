Abstract. Conventional numerical integration algorithms can not be
used for long term stability studies of complicated nonlinear Hamiltonian
systems since they do not preserve the symplectic structure of the system. Further, they can be very slow even if supercomputers are used. In
this paper, we study the symplectic integration algorithm using solvable
maps which is both fast and accurate and extend it to six dimensions.
This extension enables single particle studies using all three degrees of
freedom.

Introduction

Consider a complicated Hamiltonian system that is non-integrable. Suppose we
are interested in the long-term stability of this dynamical system. Since the
system is assumed to be non-integrable, it is very diﬃcult to give stability criteria
in an analytic form. A possible solution is to numerically follow the trajectories of
the particles through the system for a large number of iterations, a process which
goes by the name tracking. One could then infer the stability of motion in the
system by analyzing these tracking results. However, in long term integration of
these systems, it is important to preserve the Hamiltonian nature of the system at
every integration step. Otherwise, one can get spurious damping or even chaotic
behaviour which is not present in the original system. Such problems becomes
accentuated when long term integration is performed. This can then obviously
lead to wrong predictions regarding the long-term stability of the Hamiltonian
system being studied.
The most straightforward method that can be used to perform long term
tracking is numerical integration. However, a very short time step has to be
used to reduce the spurious behaviour that occurs because of the non-symplectic
integration. This makes this method so slow that it is impractical to study
the long term behaviour of very complicated systems (like the Large Hadron
Collider) even if supercomputers are used. Therefore, we need a method that is
both fast and accurate.
Several symplectic integration methods have been discussed in literature [1,2,
3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]. Methods using Lie algebraic perturbation theory which give

maps where the ﬁnal values of variables are explicit functions of initial ones
oﬀer several advantages. Further, since the whole complicated system can be
represented by a single symplectic map, there can be a substantial saving in
computation time as compared to non-map based methods. In this paper, we
extend an alternate symplectic integration method using solvable maps [12] to
six dimensions. This extension is necessary for single particle studies using all
three degrees of freedom. The above method has been shown to give good results
in lower dimensions [12].

Preliminaries

Let z = (q1 , q2 , . . . , qn , p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) denote the 2n dimensional phase space
variables. Denoting the initial and ﬁnal locations of the particle by z i and z f
respectively, the time evolution of a Hamiltonian system H(z) can be described
as a symplectic map M [13]:
(1)
z f = Mz i .

The symplectic map is related to the Hamiltonian H(z) by the equation:
dM
= M : −H(z0 ),
dt

(2)

where z0 is z at time t = 0.
Using the Dragt-Finn factorization theorem [13], the symplectic map M can
be factorized as follows.
M = M̂ exp(: f3 (z) :) · · · exp(: fm (z) :) · · · .

(3)

Here M̂ represents the linear part of the map and fm (z) is a homogeneous
polynomial of degree m in z determined uniquely by the factorization theorem.
Further : f (z) : is the Lie operator corresponding to the function f (z) and is
deﬁned by
: f (z) : g(z) = [f (z), g(z)].
(4)
Here g(z) denotes another phase space function and [f (z), g(z)] denotes the usual
Poisson bracket of the functions f (z) and g(z). The exponential of a Lie operator
is called a Lie transformation and is given as
∞
�
: f (z) :n
exp(: f (z) :) =
.
n!
n=0

(5)

The map M involves an inﬁnite number of Lie transformations and hence
for any practical computation, we have to truncate M after a ﬁnite number of
Lie transformations.
(6)
M = M̂ e:f3 : e:f4 : · · · e:fm : .
Each one of the Lie transformations in the above equation is a symplectic map
and hence the map can be truncated at any order without losing symplecticity.

896

G. Rangarajan and M. Sachidanand

The product e:f3 : e:f4 : · · · e:fm : in Eq. (6) give the nonlinear part of M. Each
of these Lie transformations gives an inﬁnite number of terms when acting on
phase space variables. Since we can not evaluate an inﬁnite number of terms in
any algorithm, we need to overcome this problem in some manner. The most
straightforward method is to truncate the Taylor series expansion of each Lie
transformation, after a ﬁnite number terms. This however violates the symplectic
condition. Though this method is justiﬁable in short term tracking, it does not
work well in long term tracking as the non-symplecticity can lead to spurious
damping or even chaotic behaviour which is not present in the original system
[10]. Therefore, we refactorize M in terms of simpler symplectic maps that can
be evaluated both exactly and quickly. We achieve this refactorization through
the so-called “solvable maps” [11,12].

Solvable Map Method

Solvable maps are generalizations of Cremona maps. The class of Cremona
maps includes only those symplectic maps for which the Taylor series expansion terminates when acting on phase space coordinates. The class of solvable maps also includes those symplectic maps for which the Taylor series expansion can be summed up explicitly. One simple example of such a map is
exp(: aq1l+2 + bq1l+1 p1 :) [12].
The basic idea behind the solvable map method is to represent each nonlinear
factor exp(: fm :) in Eq. (6) as a product of solvable maps, i.e.,
exp(: fm :) = exp(: h1 :) exp(: h2 :) · · · exp(: hn :) , for m ≥ 3 .

(7)

We also ensure that the number of solvable maps is a minimum. For simplicity,
we restrict ourselves to a general fourth order symplectic map in six dimensions.
We ﬁrst set up a notation that will facilitate the indexing of monomials in
six phase space variables. Let Pj denote the following basis monomial of degree
m in six phase-space variables
(m)

Pj

= q1r1 pr12 q2r3 pr24 q3r5 pr36 ,

(8)

where 1 ≤ ri ≤ m, r1 + r2 + . . . + r6 = m. For this six dimensional case,
the number of independent monomials of degree 3 is 56 and the number of
independent monomials of degree 4 is 126.
Consider a nonlinear Hamiltonian system in six phase space dimensions. Performing a Taylor expansion around the origin in the spirit of perturbation theory,
the Hamiltonian H(z) can be written as (up to fourth order in the phase space
variables z)
(9)
H(z) = H2 (z) + H3 (z) + H4 (z).
Here Hm (z) is a homogeneous polynomial of degree m in z. Concentrating on the
nonlinear part for the moment, H3 and H4 can be written as a linear combination

Solvable Map Method

897

of the basis monomials introduced above:
H3 (z) = γ1 P1 (z) + γ2 P2 (z) + · · · + γ56 P56 (z),
H4 (z) = γ57 P57 (z) + γ58 P58 (z) + · · · + γ182 P182 (z).

(10)
(11)

Now we express the time evolution of the Hamiltonian system H(z) as a symplectic map M4 (truncated at order 4) using the Dragt-Finn factorization:
M4 = M̂ exp(: f3 :) exp(: f4 :) ,

(12)

where M̂ is obtained from the linear part H2 (z) of the Hamiltonian H(z). Using
the basis monomials, f3 and f4 can be represented as:
f3 (z) = α1 P1 (z) + α2 P2 (z) + · · · + α56 P56 (z),

f4 (z) = α57 P57 (z) + α58 P58 (z) + · · · + α182 P182 (z).

(13)
(14)

It should be noted that there is a speciﬁc algorithm for determining the coeﬃcients αi in terms of the coeﬃcients γi and the linear part H2 (z). For a speciﬁc
Hamiltonian, many of the coeﬃcients αi could be zero.
We now refactorize the symplectic map M4 representing the original Hamiltonian system in terms of solvable maps as follows (for further details see [14]):
M = M̂ e:h1 : e:h2 : . . . e:h20 : ,

Here βi ’s are functions of αi ’s. They can be easily determined by comparing the
original factorization for M4 in terms of fi with the solvable map refactorization
in terms of hi order by order and using the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorﬀ theorem
[15]. Thus given γi ’s parameterizing the original Hamiltonian system H(z), βi ’s
can be readily determined [14].
We will now explicitly obtain the action of some of the above maps e:hi : on
the phase space variables in a closed form. This will also prove that these maps
are solvable maps. A similar analysis can be done for the remaining maps [14].
Consider the action of e:hi : on z:
z � = e:hi : z.

(16)

From Eq. (2) we see that this action is equivalent to ﬁrst integrating the equations
of motion for the Hamiltonian hi (z) from time t = 0 to time t = −1 and then
identifying the initial values z0 (at t = 0) with z and the ﬁnal values (at t = −1)
for z with z � .
First, we consider the action of e:h7 : on the phase space variables. Using the
above procedure, this action can be easily obtained and is given as follows:
q1� = q1 ,

p�1 = p1 + 2 β74 q1 p2 p3 ,

q2� = q2 − β74 q12 p3 , p�2 = p2 ,
q3� = q3 − β74 q12 p2 , p�3 = p3 .

Thus, e:h7 : is a solvable map. The action of the solvable map e:h8 : is similar to
e:h7 : .
The action of e:h9 : on the phase space variables is obtained as follows. The
appropriate Hamiltonian is
h9 = q12 p1 [β2 + β64 q2 + β65 p2 + β66 q3 + β67 p3 ] = E9 .

(17)

Here E9 denotes the conserved numerical value of h9 and is obtained by evaluating h9 at t = 0. We note that
d 2
(q p1 ) = 2q1 p1 q̇1 + q12 ṗ1 = 0.
dt 1
Therefore, q12 p1 = q120 p10 = constant . Consequently,
β2 + β64 q2 + β65 p2 + β66 q3 + β67 p3 =

where we have denoted the values of qi and pi at time t = 0 by qi0 and pi0 . Also,
we will sometimes collectively denote q1 , q2 , q3 by q and p1 , p2 , p3 by p. Further,
if q10 , p10 � = 0, we haveq1 � = 0 and from Eq. (17)

The equation for q2 is given by

∂p2

Once again integrating the above equation, we have
q2 = q20 + β65 q120 p10 t .
Similarly, integrating the equations of motion for the other variables and letting
(q, p) → (q � , p� ) , (q0 , p0 ) → (q, p) , t → −1, we get the action of e:h9 : on the
phase space variables. Thus,

This shows that e:h9 : is a solvable map. Similarly, e:h10 : , e:h11 : , ... , e:h14 : can be
shown to be solvable maps and their action on phase space variables can be got
by appropriately changing q and p in the above equations.

901

The action of the map e:h15 : on the phase space variables can be obtained in
the following way. The corresponding Hamiltonian is
h15 = β58 q13 p1 + β149 q23 p2 + β179 q33 p3 .

(18)

From the equations of motion,

Thus, e:h15 : is a solvable map. The action of the map e:h16 : is similar to that of
e:h15 : and can be got by interchanging q and p and by letting t → −t.
Finally, the action of the solvable map e:h20 : is as follows:

= q2 exp [− (β84 q1 p1 + 2 β152 q2 p2 + β162 q3 p3 )] ,
= p2 exp [(β84 q1 p1 + 2 β152 q2 p2 + β162 q3 p3 )] ,
= q3 exp [− (β91 q1 p1 + β162 q2 p2 + 2 β182 q3 p3 )] ,
= p3 exp [(β91 q1 p1 + β162 q2 p2 + 2 β182 q3 p3 )] .

Therefore e:h20 : is also a solvable map.
Using the above solvable map method, diﬀerent nonlinear Hamiltonian systems were studied and good results were obtained. Since the results obtained
are very similar to those already demonstrated in Ref. [12] for lower dimensions,
the details are omitted here.

Conclusions

We have studied a symplectic integration algorithm using solvable maps. The
solvable map factorization for three degrees of freedom (up to order 4) was
carried out and it involves 20 solvable maps. It has been shown [12] that this
algorithm gives good results for various examples. It also provides a fast and
accurate symplectic integration method for complicated Hamiltonian systems.
Another advantage of this method is that it can be easily extended to higher
dimensions since the computations involved are not that diﬃcult when symbolic
manipulation programs are used.
