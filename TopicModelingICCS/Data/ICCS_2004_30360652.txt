Abstract. A method for the visualization of correlation-based data has
been applied for analysis of the set of meteorological and environmental
parameters that describe the air pollution. A visual presentation of
data stored in the correlation matrix makes it possible for ecologists
to discover additional knowledge hidden in it. The method consists of
two stages: building of a system of vectors based on the correlation
matrix and visualization of these vectors. Sammon’s mapping and the
self-organizing map were applied for visualization of the vectors.

Introduction

Any set of environmental objects (cases, vectors) may often be characterized by
common parameters (variables, features). A combination of values of all the parameters characterizes a concrete object from the whole set. The values obtained
by any parameter depend on the values of other parameters, i.e., the parameters
are correlated. A problem of the analysis of correlations arises here. This problem
as well as a lot of real correlation matrices became classical (see [1]). However,
recent research and technology development applications produce correlation
matrices and discover knowledge via their analysis, too. Correlations of meteorological and environmental parameters and their analysis appear in various studies. The references cover air pollution, vegetation of coastal dunes, groundwater
chemistry, minimum temperature trends, zoobenthic species-environmental
relationships, analysis of large environmental and taxonomic databases.
The goal of this paper is the illustration of a possibility to apply the visualization method to the analysis of correlation matrices of parameters that are of
an environmental and ecological nature. The analysis is based on the correlation
matrix of parameters that describe the air pollution. A visual presentation of
data stored in the correlation matrix makes it possible for ecologists to discover
additional knowledge hidden in the matrix and to make proper decisions about
the interlocation of parameters and about their groups (clusters).

The Method of Visual Analysis of Correlation Matrices

One of the most popular methods of analysing correlations is the principal component analysis [2]. However, it does not show an interlocation of variables –

only their location around the zero-correlation. It means that we need more
sophisticated means for the analysis of correlations.
A method for visualizing a set of parameters x1 , ..., xn characterized by their
correlation matrix has been proposed in [1]. The method consists of two stages:
building and visualization of a system of multidimensional vectors Y1 , ..., Yn ∈ S n
corresponding to the parameters x1 , ..., xn . S n is a subset of the n-dimensional
Euclidean space Rn containing vectors of unit length.
There exist lots of methods that can be used for reducing the dimensionality
of data (see, e.g., [3]). We apply here two popular and eﬀective methods:
Sammon’s mapping [4] that is a nonlinear projection method closely related
to the metric multidimensional scaling, and the self-organizing map (SOM) [3]
that is a neural network.
Using Sammon’s mapping we reduce the dimensionality of vectors Y1 , ..., Yn ∈
S n by computing a correspondent system of two-dimensional vectors Z1 , ..., Zn ∈
R2 . The self-organizing map (SOM) is a class of neural networks that are trained
in an unsupervised manner. It is a well-known method for mapping a high
dimensional space onto a low dimensional one. We consider here a mapping
onto a two-dimensional grid of neurons. Using the SOM-based approach above,
we can draw a table with cells corresponding to the neurons. The cells corresponding to the neurons-winners are ﬁlled with the order numbers of vectors
Y1 , ..., Yn . Some cells may remain empty (see Fig. 2a). One can make a decision
visually on the distribution of the vectors Y1 , ..., Yn in the n-dimensional space in
accordance with their distribution among the cells of the table. However, the
table does not answer the question, how much the vectors of the neighboring
cells are close in the n-dimensional space. This question may be answered by
a combined mapping, i.e., by applying Sammon’s mapping to visualize the ndimensional vectors that are the numerical characteristics of neuron-winners.

Meteorological and Environmental Data Set

The experiment was carried out using the correlation matrix of 10 meteorological
and environmental parameters that describe the air pollution in Vilnius city [5]:
x1 , x2 , x3 are the concentrations of carbon monoxide CO, nitrogen oxides NOx ,
and ozone O3 ; x4 is the vertical temperature gradient measured at a 2–8 m
height; x5 is the intensity of solar radiation; x6 is the boundary layer depth; x7
is the amount of precipitation; x8 is the temperature; x9 is the wind speed; x10 is
the stability class of atmosphere. The correlation matrix is presented in Table 1.

Results of the Analysis

In Fig. 1a, we present Sammon’s mapping results of the vectors Y1 , ..., Yn calculated on the basis of the correlation matrix of parameters x1 , ..., xn (n = 10).
Fig. 1a shows the distribution of vectors Zs ∈ R2 , s = 1, n, obtained after the
application of Sammon’s algorithm to the vectors Y1 , ..., Yn . In fact, we observe
the distribution of parameters x1 , ..., xn on a plane. We do not present legends

and units for both axes in the ﬁgure, because we are interested in observing the
interlocation of points corresponding to the parameters only. The parameters
are almost uniformly distributed after a direct compression of 10-dimensional
points to a plane by Sammon’s mapping, but more similar parameters are
located nearer.
The SOM of size 4×4 was used in the experiments. The mapping results
are presented in Fig. 2a. They indicate that there are at least three clusters of
parameters. This estimate may be considered as the lower bounds for the number
of clusters. What is the upper bound? The combined mapping should be used
in search for the answer.
The results of combined mapping are presented in Fig. 2b. The ﬁgure shows
the distribution of two-dimensional vectors obtained after an application of

visually observe four clusters in Fig. 2b.

Conclusions

Comparing the results in Figures 1 and 2 on the parameters of air pollution, we can conclude that the meteorological and environmental parameters that describe the air pollution in Vilnius city form four clusters:
{x1 , x2 , x4 }, {x3 , x6 , x9 }, {x5 , x10 }, {x7 , x8 }. These clusters are separated by
curves in Fig. 1b. Data points in this ﬁgure repeat these of Fig. 1a.
One can see that the interlocation of parameters is similar in Figures 1a and
2a. The only diﬀerence is that clusters of parameters are more explicit in Fig. 2a.
The clusters are more explicit in Fig. 2b as compared with Fig. 2a.
The analysis allows us to conclude that visualization is a powerful tool in
data analysis. Its extension to the analysis of correlation matrices widened the
range of applications. Most of problems with the correlation-based data sets
may be solved in this way. In particular, the environmental problem was analysed
successfully. The conclusions on the similarity of the measured parameters as well
as on the possible number of clusters of similar parameters are drawn analysing
the visual data presentation. This becomes possible due to the given method.
