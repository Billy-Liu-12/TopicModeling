Abstract. A Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) algorithm for reliable
and fast determination of a relative radiation level in a field environment has
been developed. The background and the radioactive anomaly are assumed to
follow the normal and Poisson distributions, respectively. The SPRT
formulation has been derived and simplified based on these assumptions. The
preliminary evaluation suggests that the algorithm, while offering confident
estimations for the log-scaled radiation level, promises the additional advantage
of reduction in sampling sizes, particularly in areas with a high radiation level.

1 Introduction
Reliable and fast estimation of the local relative radiation level with respect to that of
the regional natural background, under prescribed confidence levels, is the central
focus of many environmental radiological surveys. A local relative radiation level can
be conventionally interpreted as a number of standard deviations away from the
background radiation mean. The key issues are reliability and speed. In order to
obtain a reliable estimate for a local relative radiation level, the conventional
statistical wisdom teaches us that we need more samples. However, a high radiation
anomaly may pose a significant health threat to the field surveyors. Conventional
health wisdom tells us to leave the high radiation area as soon as possible. Therefore,
we need a radiation level estimation algorithm that is both reliable for given
confidence levels and fast for high radiation areas.
In our recent research, we tailored Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test
(SPRT) [1] and developed an algorithm for the dynamic determination of the local
relative radiation level. A preliminary experiment in the laboratory environment,
using a common industrial radiation source, suggests that the algorithm is promising.
It provided a confident estimate for the local radiation level, and reduced the sampling
size requirement for high radiation spots.

2 Population Assumptions
Reconnaissance environmental radiation surveys are commonly performed by handheld gamma-detection devices, such as Geiger counters. These gamma-detection
devices produce readings of gross gamma ray counts, or the gross count (GC)
detected during a given time interval [2].

For a given high radiation anomaly, GC may be assumed to follow a Poisson
Distribution [2] with PDF:

f m1 Hx L = PH X = x L =

m x1 e -m1

x!

, x = 0, 1, 2, ..., n
(1)

Where μ1 = np  n is a large number (number of atoms in the observed physical
sample) and p is the decay rate for an individual particle for a given observation time
interval. When n is large, it can be shown that:

f m 1 H xL Ø N Hm1 , m 1 L

(2)

Where μ1 is the mean GC of the physical sample.
For regional radiation background, we assume that GC follows a simple Normal
distribution N ( μ 0 , σ 0 ) with probability distribution function (PDF):

H x-m 0 L 2

f m0 , s0 Hx L = è!!!!!!!
e 2 s0
2 p s0

,

-¶ < x < ¶

(3)

This different treatment is due to uncertainty about the number of counts in the
background sample, and if it is large enough for Poison-Normal approximation that
offers only one parameter for distribution fitting. Normal distribution, on the other
hand, has two parameters to choose and should always make a better fit to the
background samples.

3 Absolute and Discrete Radiation Levels
For measuring the absolute radiation level, the sample mean μ1 is a natural choice. In
a field survey, we are usually more interested in a discrete measure relative to the
background radiation. For this reason, we shall introduce Log Departing Coefficient
(LGC) as follows. Suppose that b (> 0) is a pre-selected log base, and r (>0) is a preselected scaling factor. Define (for l ≥ 1):

LGC = l, if m 0 + b l-1 rs 0 < m 1 b m 0 + b l rs 0
For LGC¥1, we have

LGC = CeilingBLogbB

m 1 - m0
FF
r s0

(4)

(5)

Particularly, for a region with low radiation background, we may take b=2 and
r=1, then:
m 1 - m0
LGC = CeilingBLog2B
FF
(6)
s0

When LGC=0, we can say the sample mean is no more than two standard
deviations from the regional mean. When LGC=1, we say that the sample mean is at
least two standard deviations from the regional mean, but no more than four standard
deviations from the regional mean, etc. For a region with higher radiation
background, we may adjust factor r, making r=0.5 for compensating the growing
speed of LGC. LGC defined this way can be used as a log-scaled discrete measure for
the radiation departing level (L) from the regional background.

4 Alternative Hypotheses
Let's assume that we collect observations one at a time, using a handheld device such
as a Geiger Counter, in an environmental reconnaissance radiological survey
situation. We denote xi the i'th observation, where the observation is the Gamma
Gross Counts (GC) for fixed-length time intervals. Essentially for a sample, we have
two possibilities:
(1) That the sample was from the background radiation population – the Null

Hypothesis ( H 0 ); and
(2) That the sample was from an anomaly population with higher radiation

strength – the Alternative Hypothesis ( H 1 ).
If we accept the null hypothesis H 0 , then we continue our field survey. If we
accept the alternative hypothesis H 1 , then we mark the area as an anomaly for future
detailed work and move on to the next spot.
Let a and b be the type I (false positive) and type II (false negative) errors
associated with the decisions respectively,
a = P 8 Accept H 1 when H 0 is true < = PH H 1 » H 0 L

(7)

b = P 8 Accept H 0 when H 1 is true < = PH H 0 » H 1 L

then 1-a is the confidence level of accepting

(8)

H 0 and 1-b is the confidence level of

accepting H 1 .

5 SPRT Basis
Wald's SPRT method [1] has the advantage of handling sequential sampling data. Let
{ x1 , x 2 , x 3 ,..., x n } be an (independently identically distributed) fresh data set collected
since the last decision and a new decision is yet to be made. Assuming f 0 ( x ) and
f 1 ( x ) are the PDFs for H 0 and H 1 respectively, we can construct a conventional
Logarithmic Likelihood Ratio (LLR):

f 1H x i L
¤ ni=1 f 1Hx i L
L n = LLRHx 1 , x 2 , ..., x n L = Log
n f H x L = ‚ Log f H x L
¤ i=1 0 i
0 i
i=1
n

The Wald's SPRT has the following form (although his original A and B are
somehow reversed from what are commonly used today):
1) If Λ n < A then accept H 0 , (and directly move on to next spot).
2) If A ≤ Λ n ≤ B , request additional measurement made for the same spot.
3) If Λ n > B then accept H 1 , (and mark anomaly etc., move on to the next spot).
Where A and B are two constants satisfying inequalities:

Log

b

1- a

§ A < B § Log

1- b
a

(10)

A common practice is simply to take:

A = Log

b

1- a
1- b
B = Log
a

(11)
(12)

It is clear that the parameters A and B are related only to the strengths (a, b), or
confidences (1-a, 1-b), of the test, but are independent of the actual forms of the
distribution functions.

Through some simplification, and using sample mean x for estimating μ1 , we
should finally have:

7 Computational Details
We assume that the regional background population mean μ 0 and the standard
deviations σ 0 have been estimated, and also also assume that the test strengths (a, b),
or confidences (1-a, 1-b) are given. Subsequently constants A and B can be calculated
using formula (11) and (12). For a new spot or physical sample, we take first imin
independent measures, then compute:

x H nL =

The decision and estimation for the local radiation level L are made as follows:
1) If Λ n < A then accept H 0 and assign L = 0 , output both μ1 and L ;
2) If A ≤ Λ n ≤ B , request additional measurement made for the same spot.

3) If Λ n > B then accept H 1 and compute:
ml - m0
L = LGC = CeilingBLogbB
FF
r s0
Now output both μ1 and L , and move to the next physical sample or spot.

Although SPRT sampling sequence terminates with probability 1, it does require a
stop limit. For case 2, we adapted Wald’ s stop limit[1]: if n = imax and we still have
A ≤ Λ n ≤ B , then:
if Λ imax ≤

A+ B
, we accept H 0 and assign L = 0 ;
2

(27)

if Λ imax >

A+ B
, we accept H 1 and compute L = LGC
2

(28)

Apparently, all local radiation level Ls computed this way had confidence levels
(1-a, 1-b).
This algorithm was implemented in Mathematica[3] for quick evaluation. In the
implementation, we set imin = 5 , imax = 11 , a=0.05 and b=0.05.

8 Experimental Data
Experimental data were collected in a laboratory environment using a typical
industrial Cs137 source. A device similar to a Geiger counter was used for
measuring gamma GC. The counting interval of the device was set at half of a
second. Figure 1 shows the half-second background gamma GC data measure of the
lab ground. Background radiation has a mean μ 0 = 773 and standard
deviation σ 0 = 33 . (This also suggests

33 = σ 0 ≠ μ 0 = 28

for background

radiation, and therefore anomaly source and background should be handled by
different types of distributions.)

During the experiment, a common industrial source, Cs137, was placed on top of a
table in the lab. The source gamma strength was measured at different distances from
1 to 50 feet for simulating sources of different strengths (Figure 2).

9 Results and Analysis
The SPRT derived radiation levels (LGC) of the experimental data at different
strengths (or distances) are shown in Figure 3. Comparing Figure 2 and 3, it is clear
that the SPRT radiation level or LGC is exponentially correlated to the relative
strength of the anomaly with respect to the background.

Further, the relationship between the estimated radiation level (LGC) and the
SPRT cycle length, (i.e., the number of observations needed for deriving an estimate
for radiation level) is analyze in Figure 4.
It is clear that for high-radiation anomaly ( LGC ≥ 2 ), the SPRT needs the
minimum sample size imin = 5 to derive the needed LGC with the given confidence
levels. For low-radiation anomaly ( LGC = 1 ), the SPRT needs no more than seven
observations. For background confirmation ( LGC = 0 ), the SPRT may need a longer
observation cycle, anywhere from 6 to 11 observations. This is precisely a property
we would like to have for a field radiation instrument, minimizing the time needed for
high radiation anomaly sampling.

10 Summary
Preliminary assessment suggests that the SPRT method described in this paper is a
promising algorithm for quick determination of field radiation levels. While
maintaining prescribed confidence levels for its estimations, it reduces the sample
sizes for high radiation regions or spots. This implies that it could reduce the exposure
time for the field radiation surveyors.
