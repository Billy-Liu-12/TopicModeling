Abstract
The multiscale method for computational ﬂuid dynamics (CFD) is proposed to solve viscous ﬂow problems at high
Reynolds numbers with a thin boundary layer. This method is a physics-based model, uses generalized hydrodynamic
equations proposed by Alexeev (1994), and can be interpreted as a regularization of the Navier-Stokes equations.
Numerical solutions using this approach compare favorably with experimental data for the cases we considered for
different ﬂow problems in the range of Reynolds number from Re = 3200 to 1,000,000. The method is discussed and
numerical solutions are compared with the experimental data for a 3D driven cavity ﬂow at Re = 3200 and 10,000,
2D backward facing step ﬂow at Re = 44,000, 2D channel ﬂow at Re number up to 106 , and a 3D thermal convection
in a cylinder at Ra = 1000 to 150,000. Comparison with the analytical asymptotic solution is provided for a thermal
convection, in the electrically conducting ﬂuid suppressed by a strong magnetic ﬁeld at Hartman numbers Ha up to
20,000. This multiphysics model is not a turbulence model, and no additional equations are introduced. Kinetic effects
(small ﬂow scales) are successfully captured with new terms introduced into the governing equations, and the derived
small scale of turbulence compares well with observed in the experiments by Koseff and Street (1984).

1. Introduction
Difﬁculties with the numerical solutions of Navier-Stokes (NS) equations for high Re number ﬂows have usually been referenced to insufﬁcient mesh resolution, complicated ﬂow physics, turbulence, etc. In series of papers,
Shishkin et al. (1995-1997, see e.g. [1]) demonstrated theoretically that grid methods perform poorly when dealing
with the boundary layer and provided an estimation for numerical solution error as O(1) for uniform meshes [1]. As
a remedy for these difﬁculties, the construction of special meshes was proposed, with more optimistic error estimation, as O(h1/m ), h is the mesh size, with m = 7 or more. During last decades the failure of numerical solutions to
obtain good agreement with experimental data conﬁrms Shishkin estimates (lid-driven cavity ﬂow: experiments [2]

versus simulations [3]; thermal convection in a vertical slot: experiments [4] versus simulations [5], etc.). Successful
results implementing Shishkin-type strategy are obtained in [6]. The boundary layer thickness, which is not known in
advance, is used, to construct Shishkin mesh. Meshless methods have similar drawbacks [7].
We have developed an alternate approach, that is more accurate, less mesh-dependent and can be interpreted as a
regularization of the Navier-Stokes equations, which captures all important scales of the ﬂow, resulting in mutiscale
resolution of ﬂow physics. It is based on the simpliﬁed mathematical model obtained the generalized hydrodynamic
equations by Alexeev [8], [9]. The numerical solutions agree well with the experimental measurements for a set of
ﬂow problems at high Reynolds number and for ﬂows with thin boundary layer [10]¸ [11], [12]¸ [13]¸ [14][15]. This
is not a turbulence model, and no additional equations are introduced.
The model was successfully compared to: (1) 3D driven cavity ﬂow data by Koseff and Street (1982) at Re = 3200
and Re = 10,000; (2) 2D backward facing step ﬂow by Kim et al. (1980) at Re = 44,000; (3) 3D thermal convection
in a cylinder at Ra = 1000 to 150,000; and (4) asymptotic solution for a thermal convection in the semiconductor melt
suppressed by the magnetic ﬁeld at Hartman numbers Ha up to Ha = 20, 000. Numerical results for 2D channel ﬂow
at Re number up to 106 are also presented.
2. A regularization approach to solving Navier-Stokes equations
Governing equations. To consider a ﬂow of incompressible viscous ﬂuid, in a closed 2D or 3D domain Ω,
Navier-Stokes momentum and continuity equations are:
∂V
+ (V∇)V − Re−1 ∇2 V + ∇p − F = 0
∂t
∇·V = 0

(1)
(2)

where Re = V0 L/ν is the Reynolds number, V0 is the velocity scale, L is the hydrodynamic length scale, ν is the
kinematic viscosity, and F is a body force. In the case of thermal convection the body force is F = GrRe−1 · Θ · eg
(Boussinesq approximation), where Θ is a nondimensional temperature, Gr is the Grashoff number and eg is the unit
vector in the direction of gravity. The energy equation is:
∂θ
+ (V∇)θ = Pr−1 Re−1 ∇2 θ
(3)
∂t
where θ represents nondimensional temperature, scaled by θ = (T − Tcold )/ΔT with ΔT = Thot − Tcold . The Prandtl,
Grashoff and Rayleigh numbers are respectively Pr = ν/k, Gr = Ra/Pr, and Ra = βΔT gL3 k−1 ν−1 , where β, g, k are
the coefﬁcients of thermal expansion, gravitational acceleration, and of thermodiffusivity.
We have analyzed the generalized hydrodynamic equation, proposed in [8] (a review in [9]), for the case of
incompressible viscous ﬂow and kept only a few main order terms, spatial ﬂuctuations, in the continuity equation.
This may be interpreted as a regularization of the Navier-Stokes equations.
A proposed regularization involves modifying the continuity equation (2) to become
∇ · V = τ∗ ∇ · (∇p − F)

(4)

where τ∗ is a small regularization parameter. For τ∗ → 0, eq. (4) approaches the continuity equation (2). The boundary
condition for pressure on a wall is
(∇p − F) · n = 0,

(5)

where n is a unit vector normal to the wall. Equations (4) and (5) present the basis of our method, which takes into
account only a few of many additional terms of the generalized hydrodynamic equations, called ﬂuctuations (temporal
and spatial), in [8]. Equation (5) is a condition of absence of the ﬂuctuations on walls, according to [8].
Preliminary results with a more complicated model are presented in [10] and [11]. Further numerical experiments
have shown that satisfactory results can be obtained with the simpler model presented above [12]. Numerical solutions
of eqs. (1), (3), and (4), called regularized Navier-Stokes equations (RNS), with the boundary condition (5), give a

better agreement with the experimental measurements for high Reynolds number ﬂows than the traditional solution of
Navier-Stokes eqs. (1) and (2), (NS), with the ﬁnite element method (FEM).
Note that numerical formulations, containing extra terms in the momentum and continuity equations, have been
proposed in the frame of kinetically consistent numerical schemes, developed by Elizarova and Chetverushkin [17],
[18]. The justiﬁcation of introducing extra terms into hydrodynamic equations is discussed in [19] from a physical
kinetics viewpoint. The pressure Laplacian and other terms in the discretized continuity equation, have also been
proposed by Lohner
¨
as a result of consistent treatment of the time-advancement for the continuity eq. (2) [16].
Further, eqs. (1), (3), and (4) with the boundary condition (5) are treated as mathematical model, having a control
(regularization) parameter τ∗ . This regularization parameter τ∗ is expressed dimensionally as τ∗ = τL−1V0 , where τ is
time. The dimension of τν is a length squared. We introduce the regularization length scale l with l 2 = τν and rewrite
τ∗ as τ∗ = l 2 L−2 Re = K · Re, where K = l 2 /L2 . The optimal value of τ (or l) is not known in advance. We found that,
for problems with smooth boundary conditions, the numerical solution only slightly depends on the value of τ∗ , with
τ∗ in the range of 10−8 to 10−2 . This proposed regularization has an additional useful feature for the FEM. It uses the
same order ﬁnite element approximation for velocity and pressure for RNS.
3. Numerical experiments with RNS
In this section, we present the numerical results of a few ﬂow problems, and compare these with experimental data.
The FEM was used to discretize the governing equations. Algebraic equations for momentum and continuity were
solved simultaneously using the iterative CNSPACK solver [20], with preconditioning by a high order incomplete
decomposition. Iteration termination critetion was a convergence of relative residuals to 10−8 (or 10−12 ).
Driven cavity problem. Shown in Fig. 1 are the numerical solutions, with RNS employed [10],[12], against
the 2D and 3D driven cavity ﬂow data at Re = 3, 200 and 10, 000 [2], and results by other methods. We used 81x81
node uniform triangular mesh for the RNS. The same mesh, with quadratic for velocity and linear for pressure ﬁnite
elements, was used in a standard FEM solution of eqs. (1, 2). These results are labeled as NS in Fig. 1(a) and 1(c).
The RNS model parameter, τ∗ (or l 2 in l 2 L−2 ), was varied to match one of the experimental velocity proﬁles. A
value, l 2 L−2 ≈ 1.5 · 10−5 , resulted in good agreement for all the velocity proﬁles and both ﬂow regimes, Re = 3, 200
and 10, 000. To our surprise, the dimensional value of l 0.58mm was a good approximation to the experimentally
observed “Kolmogorov microscale” lexp 0.5mm (see [2], p. 398).
For 3D ﬂow we solved the RNS at Re = 3200 for half of the cavity with a mesh of 41x41x33 nodes (221,892
unknowns), reﬁned near the walls. The symmetry condition was used on the vertical symmetry plane y = 1.5. The
same 2D value of K = 1.5 · 10−5 was used in the 3D computations, the modeling results are presented in Fig. 1 as well.
One can see that the velocities obtained for both the 2D and 3D proﬁles are close to the experimental data, except in

one region. We did not obtain the 3D stationary solution at Re = 104 . The solution went unstationary at Re ≥ 8, 450.
According to Baggett and Trefethen [22], the stationary solution exists, but the basin of attraction of this solution may
be extraordinarily narrow, having a width of O(Reα ) for some α < −1.
Mass conservation in the continuity equation was thoroughly analyzed. The local values of divV for the numerical
solution were examined. The conclusion was that a numerical solution for the RNS model has the same order of error
in the mass conservation as the NS solution with the same number of mesh nodes [12].
The residuals of numerical solutions in the momentum equation (1) are presented in Fig. 1b. It shows one to two
order reductions for the RNS solution residual in the boundary layer, compared to the NS solution residual.
Flow over a backward facing step. The numerical results for a 2D ﬂow over a backward facing step of height
H, H = L/3 (L is a channel height) at Re = 4.4 · 104 (or ReL = 1.32 · 105 in [24]) were obtained and compared with
the experimental measurements of [23]. We used a 110x60 mesh, reﬁned near the walls, and started the computations
at a low Reynolds number. We raised Re in small increments until reaching 44, 000. Fig. 2(a) presents the computed
velocity proﬁle, at x = 5.33H (x = 0 at the edge of the step), and the experimental mean velocity measurements [23].
The RNS model output satisfactorily agrees with the experimental data for both the velocity proﬁle and the reexp
circulation zone length Xr . We computed Xr /H = 7.50, while Xr /H ≈ 7 ± 0.5 was obtained experimentally. The
∗
−2
value of τ used in the computations was in the range of 10 to 10−4 . This did not noticeably inﬂuence the results.
For smaller values of τ∗ , it was more difﬁcult to reach the steady state solution at Re = 44, 000; more and smaller
increments in Re had tobe used. If the increments in the Re number were large, the ﬂow pattern bifurcated to an
unsteady ﬂow, with vortices periodically originating from the recirculation zone and ﬂowing downstream.
The solution with a standard k − ε model shows the velocity proﬁle at x = 5.33 that has no backward ﬂow. A
standard k − ε model underpredicts the recirculation zone length Xr by a substantial amount, 20-25% according to
[24], where more sophisticated turbulence models have been proposed for this problem.
Flow in a 2D channel, of height H = 1 and length L = 4, was the subject of a few experiments with the RNS at
Reynolds numbers Re = 5 · 103 , 104 , 105 and 106 . An 81x100 mesh reﬁned near the walls was used. Inlet ﬂow proﬁles
were (i) U = 1, and (ii) U = 6z(1 − z). We were obtained both parabolic and “turbulent” ﬂow proﬁles for Re up to 105 ,
depending on the inlet ﬂow conditions and the value of τ∗ . To obtain a “turbulent” ﬂow proﬁle at Re = 5, 000, with
the inlet condition (ii), we started with τ∗ = 0.01, and were then able to keep this “turbulent” proﬁle type at reduced
1
τ∗ , down to 10−4 (Fig. 2b). The boundary layer thickness is about δ ∼ Re− 2 (obtained graphically from Fig. 2b).
3D Thermal convection in a differentially heated horizontal cylinder. Alinear temperature proﬁle is given
assumed on a cylinder wall. Experimental data by Bogatirev et al. [27] and ﬁnite volume simulations by Bessonov
[26] are used for comparison at Rayleigh numbers in the range of 103 to 1.2 · 105 , Pr = 0.9 (Fig. 3a). For the linear
temperature distribution on a cylinder wall, we obtained good agreement with the numerical results [26]. We used
a 17, 4357 node hexaedral mesh reﬁned near the walls. Agreement with the experimental data was not good for
Ra > 2000 (solid line in Fig. 3b). Therefore computations were done for a real, ﬁnite wall conductivity [26]. The
thermodiffusivity data for stainless steel was used, and the adjoint problem was solved. Thereby, agreement with the
experimental data has been signiﬁcantly improved (Fig. 3b, dashed line). The value of τ∗ used was 10−7 to 10−3 ,
which did not noticeably affect the RNS results.
Magnetic ﬁeld suppression of the semiconductor melt ﬂow, modeling with RNS, is considered in [13] and [14].
The application of magnetic ﬁelds is a promising approach for reducing convection during directional solidiﬁcation
of electrically conductive melts. Current technology allows for experiments using very strong static ﬁelds, for which
nearly convection free segregation is expected in melts exposed to stabilizing temperature gradients (vertical Bridgman
method) [28]. The governing equations solved for this problem are eqs. (1), (3), and (4), where F, the body force due
to the magnetic ﬁeld (Lorenz force), is given by
F = PrHa2 [(V × eB ) × eB ].

Here F=(Pr(Ha)2U, 0) for the 2D case of a vertical magnetic ﬁeld and U is the horizontal component of the velocity.
σ
The Hartmann number, given by Ha = LB0 νρ
, is in the range of Ha = 100 to 104 , for the materials and magnetic

ﬁelds under investigation. Here ρ, σ are the density and electrical conductivity, B0 is the magnetic ﬁeld intensity, and
eB is the unit vector in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.
The computations are difﬁcult because of the thin boundary layer, although the velocity of the generated ﬂows is
extremely low, Re ∼ 10−1 to 10−6 . A high value of the Hartmann number results in a relatively small coefﬁcient at the

of thickness δ ∼ Ha−1 , along with “equivalent” Reynolds number Reeqv ∼ Ha2 , Reeqv = 4 · 104 for B=0.5 Tesla, and
Reeqv = 4 · 108 for B=50 Tesla. Some of the results for 2D models are shown in Fig. 4. The RNS numerical solution
is rather smooth even for a very thin boundary layer, with thickness δ ∼ 10−4 (Ha = 2 · 104 ). Other methods tested in
[13], [14] (including industrial code) did not provide acceptable results or failed for Ha > 100.
Conclusions
The RNS method demonstrated as an efﬁcient approach for multiscale simulations 2D and 3D ﬂows at high
Reynolds number, which resolves all important ﬂow scales including thin boundary layers. The numerical results
compared favorably with experimental data for driven cavity ﬂow, ﬂows in channels, thermal convection, and asymptotic solutions for electrically conductive ﬂuid ﬂows under strong magnetic ﬁelds. The RNS method is used for
modeling 3D thermo-vibrational convection in Bridgman melt conﬁgurations [15]. Similar ideas have been used successfully to improve the accuracy of the meshless multiquadric radial-basis function methods [29], [30]. We consider
this approach as multiphysics model for wide range of application to ﬂow simulations with different ﬂow scales and a
variety physical ﬁelds involved.
