Abstract
This work extends PneumoCAD, a Computer-Aided Diagnosis system for detecting pneumonia in infants using radiographic
images [1], with the aim of improving the system’s accuracy and robustness. We implement and compare three contemporary
machine learning classiﬁers, namely: Na¨ıve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Results
of our experiments demonstrate that the SVM classiﬁer produces the best overall results.
Keywords: Machine Learning; Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD); Childhood pneumonia;

1. Introduction
Pneumonia is an epidemic disease characterized by acute lower respiratory infection, usually caused by viruses
or bacteria and, less commonly, other microorganisms. According to the World Health Organization (WHO),
pneumonia is the leading cause of death in children worldwide, killing an estimated 1.2 million children under
ﬁve years old every year, most in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. This number is higher than the mortality
rate for several other diseases, such as AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, combined [2].
Currently the best and most widely accepted imaging modality for detecting pneumonia is chest radiographs
[3]. However, some studies have shown that errors are common in the interpretation of chest radiographs, due to
inter-observer variation [4]. This limitation of human expert-based diagnosis has provided a strong motivation for
the use of computer technology to improve the speed and accuracy of the detection process.
A Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) software can be deﬁned as a second opinion in a diagnostic [5]. This
kind of software is utilized to improve diagnostic accuracy, not as a means of replacing the specialist, but instead
working like a second one. Using feature extraction and supervised learning classiﬁers a CAD system can mimic
the specialist’s vision and ability to diagnose.
In this work we use the same features and dataset employed in previous studies [1] [6], which have resulted in
a full CAD system for pneumonia detection called PneumoCAD, which has been applied to assist in diagnostics,
as well as to train and improve radiologists’ expertise in childhood pneumonia detection using chest radiographs

[6]. PneumoCAD is currently in prototype stage. The ultimate goal behind PneumoCAD is to create a website that
will provide remote diagnosis functionality by analyzing uploaded chest radiographs and processing them using
image processing and machine learning algorithms.
This work was geared towards performing a comparative performance analysis of state-of-art machine learning
classiﬁers combined with feature selection algorithms, to improve PneumoCAD accuracy and ﬁnd out the best
classiﬁer for childhood pneumonia detection.
2. Methods
The image dataset used in PneumoCAD consists of 156 8-bit grayscale images obtained with a digital camera, that captured the chest X-rays images at a resolution of 1024 × 768 pixels. Out of these images, 78 show
pneumonia while the remaining 78 do not. Figure 1 shows examples of the images in the dataset. These images
were analyzed by two trained radiologists according to WHO guidelines [7] [8] which produced the ground truth
needed to test the machine learning classiﬁers used in this work.

The following texture-based features were selected, implemented, and tested: coeﬃcient of variation, contrast,
correlation, energy, average energy, entropy, average deviation, diﬀerence
ﬀ
variance, diﬀ
ﬀerence entropy, inverse
diﬀerence
ﬀ
moment, residual mean, sum average, sum entropy, sum variance, suavity, variance, standard deviation
[9] [10] [11] [12]. All features have been extracted in nine subspaces of Haar wavelet.
Method 1
First each feature was tested with three classiﬁers, KNN, SVM and Na¨¨ıve Bayes. In order to compare with
previous results [6], we used three random sets of 40 images each and then, from each set, a random subset of 15
images. We then perform three tests alternating the subsets, two as training set and the other as test. All the three
tests are performed only with diﬀerence
ﬀ
variance feature and with k parameter in KNN deﬁned as 9. For SVM we
used standards Gaussian kernel parameters (C = 1, σ = 1).
Method 2
In order to test the robustness of each classiﬁer applied in pneumonia detection and to avoid overﬁtting, we
applied a second methodology with no randomization of the training set. Outliers which are out of the interval
x¯ − σ ≤ x ≤ x¯ + σ, where x is a sample, x¯ the feature mean and σ the standard deviation, were removed. We then
performed a 10-fold cross-validation test with each classiﬁer using every feature in 9 subspaces of wavelet. After
identifying and selecting the three best possible features for each classiﬁer, we performed with these an exhaustive
search, testing many possible values for each parameter, according to Table 1.

Method 3
Finally we tested another approach for feature selection, which takes the full feature vector, with all 17 texture
features, and uses a Sequential Forward Elimination (SFE) test, which is a simple greedy search algorithm, to ﬁnd
the best feature set for each classiﬁer [13] [14].
3. Results
Method 1
With the ﬁrst methodology good accuracy results were obtained, and these are the best ﬁgures: 82% with
KNN, 80% with SVM and 60% with Na¨ıve Bayes. SVM and KNN classiﬁers obtained good results, but also
bad results in other runs, e.g., 50% with KNN and SVM. So a second methodology is important to evaluate the
problem using all data set with cross-validation tests, because the random set selection may lead to biases that
favor one classiﬁer over another and make the overall comparison less meaningful.
Method 2
Feature tests were performed with the three classiﬁers. Several features have shown overall good results,
namely: entropy, diﬀerence variance, sum entropy, and suavity.

After obtaining the three best features for KNN and SVM, we performed a calibration test, to improve the
accuracy results, as shown on Figure 2. In SVM tests the best values for the parameters were: {C = 1.2; σ = 1}
for entropy, {C = 5.7; σ = 0.5} for diﬀerence variance and {C = 0.6; σ = 0.6} for sum entropy. For KNN the best
calibration led to k=11 for suavity, k=7 for sum entropy and k=9 for entropy.

Our third method, using a feature selection algorithm, produced some good results (Table 2). With SVM the
selected features were: correlation, average deviation, diﬀerence variance and standard deviation, one wavelet

subspace from each. With KNN the selected features were: energy and suavity, with one subspace each. Na¨ıve
Bayes best result was with: entropy, diﬀerence variance and sum average, one subspace each.
So the best combination founded for the problem is a SVM classiﬁer calibrated with {C = 1; σ = 2} and a
feature set selected by SFE algorithm in the Haralick texture features, which provide an accuracy of 77%, what is
higher than previous version of PneumoCAD and Medical Residents [4], as shown in Table 3.

4. Conclusion
In this paper, three contemporary machine learning classiﬁers (Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbors,
and Na¨ıve Bayes) were tested to identify and classify radiographic images in order to to detect and diagnose childhood pneumonia. The classiﬁers have been evaluated with a dataset taken from clinical routine. The classiﬁers
were optimized with best features, and tested with a cross-validation method to ensure that there is no overﬁtting.
SVM and KNN have shown good results (77% and 70%, respectively), but SVM produces a slightly better result
in average accuracy. The Na¨ıve Bayes classiﬁer came third, with best accuracy at 68%.
In summary, the SVM classiﬁer produced most accurate results and has shown to be more stable with training
data variation. Moreover, it outperforms the best result from previous work, and even outperforms the diagnosis
accuracy of medical residents.
