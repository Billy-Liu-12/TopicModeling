Abstract. This paper addresses the problem of investment assessment and
selection. A number of various performance measures are evaluated and
studied. The goal of these investigations is to compare these performance
measures on real-life data and to discover an optimal performance measure for
selecting investment strategies in an evolutionary stock trading decision support
system. Evaluations have been performed on financial time series from the
Paris Stock Exchange.

1 Introduction
A trader on the stock market deals with the problem of selecting one of a number of
possible investments. The trader evaluates the performance of investments, and
decides to invest in the one whose performance is the highest. The performance
measure depends on the trader’s profit preferences, risk aversion and utility function.
Traders are interested in the profitability of their investments. Since the future
return rates are unknown, traders must estimate them on the basis of a number of past
observations. Certainly, traders also estimate the risk related to achieving the desired
returns [4]. The expected return rate and the risk constitute the main factors of
performance measures.
There are a large number of performance measures [1, 2, 12, 13] coming from
several well-known stock market models. Each model makes some assumptions on,
among other things, investment return distributions. In practice, the stock market does
not perfectly suit any of these models, so the prediction may fail.
Traders use models and their theoretical background as the means to achieve
profits. They are particularly interested in obtained return rates. This does not mean
that traders are interested in high expected return rates – it means that traders are
interested in high achieved return rates. The expected return rate is the rate estimated
a priori, before a trader begins playing on the stock market over a specific time
period. Certainly, it depends on the stock market model assumed. The achieved return
rate is the rate evaluated a posteriori, after a trader completes playing on the stock
market over a specific time period. It does not depend on the stock market model
assumed because it is evaluated a posteriori on the basis of known return rates.
A trader selects an investment according to a chosen performance measure. The
pragmatic question is how the performance relates to return rates achieved [8, 9]. Is
the performance measure appropriate?

In this paper, a number of various performance measures are investigated and the
relation between the evaluated performance and return rates achieved is studied. The
goal of these investigations is to compare these performance measures on real-life
data and to discover the optimal performance measure for selecting investment
strategies in an evolutionary stock trading decision support system [6, 7]. This is
crucial to the efficiency and the quality of elaborated trading expertise. Experiments
were performed on financial time series from the Paris Stock Exchange.
This paper is structured in the following manner: Section 2 defines the problem.
Section 3 presents first investigations on selecting one of two possible investments.
Section 4 discusses applying various performance measure to four financial time
series, which include price quotations of four stocks from the Paris Stock Exchange.
Section 5 presents an evolutionary stock trading expert system. Section 6 discusses
applying various performance measures in the system. Section 7 concludes the paper.

2 Problem Definition
At time t, a trader evaluates performance of all possible financial assets, and decides
to invest in an asset A whose performance Pt(A) is the highest. He may also estimate a
priori a return rate r(e)t’(A) of the asset A over the future time period (t, t’]. Later, at
time t’, the trader evaluates a posteriori a return rate rt’(A) of the asset A achieved
over the recently-passed time period (t, t’] and compares it to the expected return rate
estimated a priori. Let δt, t’(A) = rt’(A) - r(e)t’(A).
Even though the asset A had been selected because its performance Pt(A) was the
highest, sometimes either rt’(A) was average in comparison with return rates achieved
by other investments, or δt, t’(A) was too large with respect to the risk estimated. If this
occurs too often, the chosen performance measure may be inappropriate.
In this paper, classic performance measures are investigated, such as the Sharpe
ratio (the ratio of the return rate to the standard deviation of the return rate), the
Treynor ratio (the ratio of the return rate to the beta coefficient), the Jensen alpha,
performance measures with asymmetric preferences, such as the Sortino ratio (the
ratio of the return rate to the SSD), the ROAS (the ratio of the return rate to the AS),
the ROPS (the ratio of the return rate to the PS), as well as practitioner performance
measures, such as the Calmar ratio (the ratio of the return rate to the MMD) and the
Sterling ratio (the ratio of the return rate to the average MMD), where

SSD = avg[(t − r ) 2 : t > r )] , AS = avg[(t − r ) : t > r )] , PS = 13 / 20 ,
MMD is the maximum drawdown (i.e. maximum sustained drop over relevant period)
and alpha and beta come from the CAPM model.
The first goal is to compare these performance measures using the financial time
series from the Paris Stock Exchange. The second goal is to discover the optimal
performance measure for selecting investment strategies in an evolutionary stock
trading decision support system.

3 Selecting One of Two Investments
Let A and B be two available investments. At time t, a trader selects one of them
according to a performance measure P. Later, at time t’, the trader evaluates a
posteriori the return rate rt’(A) and rt’(B) of both investments achieved over the
recently-passed time period (t, t’] and checks whether the investment with the higher
performance has also the higher return rate.
Such experiments were performed using two stocks, AXA and Peugeot, for various
t and t’ in a period from January 4, 1999 to November 7, 2003, using the Sharpe ratio
as the performance measure P.
When AXA had a higher Pt (546 observations), the return rate of AXA was higher
than the return rate of Peugeot in 299 observations. When Peugeot had a higher Pt
(653 observations), the return rate of Peugeot was higher than the return rate of AXA
in 369 observations. That gives the accuracy of the Sharpe ratio η = (299 + 369) /
(546 + 653) = 0.5571. That means that the Sharpe ratio led to the correct investment
selection in 55.71% of observations.
In further experiments, the trader selects an investment only if the difference
between its performance and the performance of the other investment is significant,
i.e. it is greater than a given threshold θ. For θ = 0.1, the accuracy of the Sharpe ratio
is η = (137 + 233) / (243 + 384) = 0.5901. For θ = 0.2, the accuracy of the Sharpe
ratio is η = (53 + 146) / (97 + 232) = 0.6049. Results of the other experiments are
presented in Table 1.

Table 1 shows that relation between certain performance measures and return rates
is weak (e.g. the ROAS ratio). However, some performance measures, such as the
Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio and the Sterling ratio, may be used to select one of two
investments if a proper threshold θ is defined.

4 Performance Measures on Financial Time Series
Let P be a specified performance measure. Let A be a financial asset. At time t, a
trader evaluates a performance Pt(A) and decides to invest in A. He also estimates a
priori a return rate r(e)t’(A) over the future time period (t, t’]. Later, at time t’, the

838

P. Lipinski and J.J. Korczak

trader evaluates a posteriori the return rate rt’(A) achieved over the recently-passed
time period (t, t’] and compares it to the expected return rate r(e)t’(A) estimated a
priori. Let δt, t’(A) = rt’(A) - r(e)t’(A).
Such experiments were performed using four stocks from the Paris Stock
Exchange, AXA, Credit Lyonnais, Peugeot and STMicroelectronics, for various t and
t’ in a period from January 4, 1999 to November 7, 2003 using various performance
measures. A set of observations, consisting of Pt(A), r(e)t’(A), rt’(A) and δt, t’(A), was
obtained for each stock and each performance measure. Since the results were quite
similar, only experiments concerning AXA are presented in detail.
Figure 1 shows how δt, t’ is related to the performance measure values Pt. Although
no direct relation is evident, some dependencies may be observed. For instance
(Figure 1a), one can notice that investments with a Sharpe ratio of Pt < 0.02 generally
have a larger δt, t’ than investments with a Sharpe ratio of Pt > 0.02. Thus, traders
should rather focus on investments with a Sharpe ratio of Pt > 0.02. The remaining
question is whether greater values of the Sharpe ratio Pt entail smaller values of δt, t’.
In general, the answer is no because, for instance, the spread of δt, t’ seems to be quite
similar for Pt = 0.02 and Pt = 0.03.

Moreover, experiments similar to those from the previous section were carried out.
For each two observations, their performances and their achieved return rates were
compared in order to verify whether the investment with the higher performance has
also the higher return rate. Results of these experiments are presented in Table 2.

Table 2 conforms to results presented in the previous section. The Sharpe ratio, the
Sortino ratio and the Sterling ratio are more accurate than the other measures.
Although the direct dependence rt’ on Pt were not evident, it is interesting to
estimate and compare the conditional probabilities P[rt’ > θr | Pt ≤ θP] and P[rt’ > θr |
Pt > θP] for certain thresholds θP and θr. Unfortunately, it requires some assumptions
on return rate distributions, which might be hard to verify. However, frequencies of
occurrences of observations with high rt’ in a set of observations with high Pt were
investigated. Let U denote the set of all observations. Let U’ denote a set of
observations with high Pt (i.e. Pt > θP) and V denote a set of observations with high rt’
(i.e. rt’ > θr). Let α = |V ∩ U’| / |U’| and α’ = |V ∩ (U-U’)| / |U-U’|. Table 3 presents
results for various performance measures.

Experiments prove that observations with high rt’ occur much more frequently in
the set of observations with high Pt than in the set of observations with average Pt.
Certainly, the frequency is different for different performance measure.
To conclude, none of the performance measures considered in this paper constitute
perfect criteria for investment selection. However, they significantly do increase the
chance of selecting profitable investments. Applications of these performance
measures in an evolutionary stock trading decision support system is presented in next
sections.

5 An Evolutionary Stock Trading Expert System
Traders on the stock market observe quotations of stock prices with the aim to sell an
item if it tends to lose value, to buy an item if it tends to gain value, and to take no

840

action in the remaining cases. Traders often assume that future values can be, more or
less accurately, predicted on the basis of past observations. Many methods that
analyze past data behavior were introduced [3, 11, 14]. These methods, herein
referred to as trading rules, attempt to detect trends or discover contexts leading to
occurrences of particular events, which for instance might cause a rise or fall in stock
prices.
Let Kt denote the knowledge available at time t. This knowledge may represent
historical data, previous stock quotations, or other information on the considered
stock. The concept of a stock market trading rule may be formalized by a function f,
which computes a decision f(Kt) ∈ {-1.0 ≡ sell, 0.0 ≡ do nothing, 1.0 ≡ buy} on the
basis of the knowledge Kt available at time t. Naturally, the function f may be defined
in a variety of ways.
Although the number of trading rules commonly used by financial experts and
market traders is large, some rules may be effective during one time period and less
effective during another time period, some rules may work well only in combination
with others. At time t, each trader bases his decision on a certain set of trading rules.
The trader chooses the set of rules according to criteria defined by his preferences,
concerning, for instance, expected profit rate and risk aversion. Depending on the
choice of rules, the trader may receive different advice. The question is which rules
the trader should choose.
Let e be a subset of the entire set of trading rules { f1, f2, …, fN }. Such a subset will
be referred to as a stock market trading expert. In a natural way, the expert e can be
presented as a binary vector of length N. The i-th coordinate of the vector corresponds
to the i-th rule, where 0 stands for absence of the rule and 1 stands for presence of the
rule.
A result re(t) of the expert e at time t is defined as the average of results of trading
rules included in the expert. The result re(t) close to –1 corresponds to advice to sell,
close to 1 to advice to buy, and otherwise indicates no recommendation, i.e. is
interpreted as advice to do nothing. Let de(t) denote the decision of the expert e at
time t.
Since the number of trading rules is large (N = 350 in these investigations), the
number of possible experts is enormous (equal to 2N = 2350), making the process of
manual selection impractical, so a computer decision support system is proposed to
make this selection.
The optimal expert is chosen by an evolutionary algorithm [5, 10] according to a
given performance measure. Certainly, different performance measures lead to
different optimal experts. The question is which performance measure should be
applied in order to obtain the most profitable experts.

6 Performance Measures in the Evolutionary Expert System
This section discusses applying performance measures presented in Section 2 to
assessment and selection of experts in the evolutionary expert system.
Experiments were performed on four stocks from the Paris Stock Exchange, AXA,
Credit Lyonnais, Peugeot and STMicroelectronics, for specified t and t’ in a period

Performance Measures in an Evolutionary Stock Trading Expert System

from January 4, 1999 to November 7, 2003 using various performance measures. For
each stock and each performance measure, a set of observations, which consist of Pt
and rt’ evaluated on 8000 trading experts, was obtained. 4000 of experts were
randomly generated, so their values Pt were average, and 4000 were optimized by the
evolutionary algorithm with a relevant objective function, so their values Pt were
high.
Although the direct dependence rt’ on Pt were not evident, frequencies of highly
profitable expert occurrences in a set of experts with high Pt were investigated. Let U
denote the entire set of all 8000 experts. Let U’ denote a set of experts with high Pt
(i.e. Pt > θP, for a certain threshold θP) and V denote a set of experts with high rt’ (i.e.
rt’ > θr, for a certain threshold θr). Let α = |V ∩ U’| / |U’| and α’ = |V ∩ (U-U’)| / |UU’|. Table 4 presents results for various performance measures.

Experiments prove that highly profitable experts occur much more frequently in
the set of experts with high Pt than in the set of experts with average Pt. Although the
frequency is different for different performance measures, none of the performance
measures may be used itself as perfectly efficient selection criteria. It may be
interesting to build a multi-objective performance measure based on performance
measures investigated in this paper.

7 Conclusions
In this paper, a problem of investment assessment and selection was considered. A
number of various performance measures were evaluated. Relation between the
performance evaluated and return rates achieved was investigated. A few relatively
efficient performance measures were applied to select investment strategies in an
evolutionary stock trading decision support system.
A large number of experiments were carried out in order to compare various
performance measures. All experiments were performed on real-life data from the
Paris Stock Exchange. Experiments showed that the most efficient performance
measures are the Sharpe ratio, the Sortino ratio and the Sterling ratio. However, the
efficiency may be slightly different over different time periods. Therefore, the
presented hypotheses have to be also tested on other markets with variable time
horizon.
Although the direct relation between evaluated performance and future return rates
is weak and none of the considered measures may be used itself as a perfectly

842

efficient selection criterion, several of them significantly increase the chance of
selecting a highly profitable investment. Thus, they may be used to build a common
multi-objective performance measure. Further research on these issues may lead to
valuable results.
