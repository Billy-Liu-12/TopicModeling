Abstract. We apply the ﬁnite volume method to a spherically symmetric conservation law of advection-diﬀusion-reaction type. For the numerical ﬂux we use the so-called complete ﬂux scheme. In this scheme the
ﬂux is computed from a local boundary value problem for the complete
equation, including the source term. As a result, the numerical ﬂux is the
superposition of a homogeneous ﬂux and an inhomogeneous ﬂux. The resulting scheme is second order accurate, uniformly in the Peclet numbers.
Keywords: ﬁnite volumes, advection diﬀusion equation, complete ﬂux
scheme.

Introduction

Many problems in physics and engineering can be modelled using conservation
laws. These laws lead in general to a system of partial diﬀerential equations that
cannot be solved analytically. Finite volume methods are a popular choice to
discretise these equations, because they feature a discrete conservation property:
the computational domain is divided into control volumes and on each volume
a discrete conservation law holds.
In this paper we study a ﬁnite volume method for three-dimensional spherically symmetric steady conservation laws. This type of equation arises, e.g.,
in combustion theory, where the study of laminar spherical ﬂames is useful for
ﬁnding parameters such as burning velocity or ﬂame curvature in premixed combustion [1].
Our model problem includes advection, diﬀusion and reaction terms and we
shall develop a numerical scheme that is second order accurate for all ﬂow conditions. This means that the scheme should always retain its high accuracy, unlike,
e.g., standard exponentially ﬁtted schemes, which are second order accurate for
diﬀusion dominated ﬂows but reduce to the ﬁrst order upwind scheme when the
advection term becomes large. Additionally the proposed scheme does not produce spurious oscillations for advection dominated ﬂows, which is a well-known
ﬂaw of standard central discretisations.
High accuracy and the absence of wiggles are favourable properties that
may also be achieved by using high resolution schemes such as ﬂux limiting or

(weighted) essentially nonoscillatory (ENO) methods [4]. These techniques lead
to larger discretisation stencils however which is disadvantageous. The method
we present uses direct neighbours only.
Our algorithm is an extension of the ﬁnite volume methods for Cartesian
grids introduced in [2,5,6] to spherically symmetric conservation laws. We use
an exponential scheme for computing the numerical ﬂuxes. The approximation
for the ﬂux is based on the complete diﬀerential equation. This implies that we
also include the source term in the numerical ﬂuxes.
Manzini and Russo [3] also present a ﬁnite volume method for advectiondominated problems that is second-order accurate away from boundary and
internal layers. They pay special attention to the construction of the numerical
advective ﬂuxes in order to prevent numerical oscillations. This goal is achieved
by a sophisticated reconstruction algorithm for cell gradients and a velocitybiased mixing of upwind and downwind contributions. Their scheme contains a
nonlinear term for shock capturing.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we formulate a stationary
advection-diﬀusion-reaction equation, introduce control volumes and formulate
a second order discrete conservation law. In Section 3, we derive an expression
for the numerical ﬂux that is second order accurate for all ﬂow conditions. In
Section 4, we combine the discrete conservation law with the numerical ﬂux and
apply the resulting scheme to a spherically symmetric boundary value problem.
We show numerical results using both the homogeneous and the complete ﬂux
scheme. By means of Richardson extrapolation we verify the order of accuracy
of the ﬁnite volume scheme for diﬀerent ﬂow conditions.

Finite Volume Discretization

In this section we outline the ﬁnite volume method (FVM) for three-dimensional,
spherically symmetric conservation laws.
Consider the following steady conservation law of advection-diﬀusion-reaction
type, i.e.,
∇·(mϕ − Γ ∇ϕ) = s,
(1)
where m is the mass ﬂux, Γ ≥ Γmin > 0 a diﬀusion/conduction coeﬃcient and
s a (chemical) source term. The unknown ϕ can be, e.g., the temperature or
the concentration of a species in a reacting mixture. The parameters Γ and s
are usually (complicated) functions of the unknown ϕ, however, for the sake of
discretisation we will consider these as given functions of the spatial coordinate
x. Equation (1) has to be coupled with the ﬂow equations, i.e., the continuity
equation and the momentum equations. The former reads
∇·m = 0.

(2)

Associated with (1), we introduce the ﬂux vector f , deﬁned by
f := mϕ − Γ ∇ϕ.

(3)

653

Equation (1) then simply reduces to ∇·f = s.
In a FVM we cover the domain with a ﬁnite number of control volumes Ωj (j =
1, 2, . . . , N ) and impose the integral form of the conservation law for each control
volume, i.e.,
f ·n dS =
∂Ωj

s dV,

(4)

Ωj

where n is the outward unit normal on the boundary ∂Ωj . Next, we need numerical approximations for the integrals in (4). In the following, we assume the
problem to be spherically symmetric, i.e., ϕ = ϕ(r), and likewise for all other
variables, and moreover, f = f (r)er with er the ﬁrst basis vector in spherical coordinates. We introduce a spatial grid {rj } of (uniform) grid size Δr.
As control volumes we choose the spherical shells Ωj := (rj−1/2 , rj+1/2 ) with
rj+1/2 := 12 (rj + rj+1 ). Then, the surface integral in (4) reduces to
f ·n dS =

the numerical ﬂux.

Derivation of the Numerical Flux

Our objective in this section is to derive an expression for the numerical ﬂux
that is uniformly second order accurate in the grid size, i.e., the discretisation
error should always be second order for all ﬂow regimes in combination with a
source term of arbitrary strength.
We adopt the following notation: variables deﬁned in the grid points rj and
rj+1 are indicated with the subscripts C and E, respectively, and variables at
the interface rj+1/2 by the subscript e. The derivation of the expression for the
numerical ﬂux Fe at the eastern cell interface re located between the grid points
rC and rE is based on the following model boundary value problem (BVP) for
the unknown ϕ:
1 2
= s, rC < r < rE ,
r mϕ − Γ ϕ
r2
ϕ(rC ) = ϕC , ϕ(rE ) = ϕE ,

(8a)
(8b)

654

where the prime ( ) denotes diﬀerentiation with respect to r. In the derivation
that follows, we assume that
M := r2 m = Const > 0

for r ∈ (rC , rE ).

(9)

Note that the condition M = Const is a direct consequence of the continuity
equation (2). The diﬀusion coeﬃcient Γ and the source term s are arbitrary
suﬃciently smooth functions of r. The (scalar) ﬂux corresponding to (8) reads
f := mϕ − Γ ϕ .

(10)

To derive the expression for Fe we carry out the following procedure:
1. Derive the integral expression for ϕ(r) from the inhomogeneous BVP (8).
2. Derive the integral representation for f (re ) from (10).
3. Approximate all integrals involved.
In the following, we need the variables D, λ, Λ and S, deﬁned by
D(r) := Γ (r)r2 ,

M

D(r)

λ(r) :=

r

Λ(r) :=

r

λ(η) dη,

η 2 s(η) dη.

S(r) :=

re

(11)
The variable Λ(r) is called the Peclet integral. Substituting (10) in (8a) and
integrating the resulting equation we obtain the following integral balance
r2 f (r) − r2 f (re ) = S(r).

(12)

Using the deﬁnitions of D and Λ in (11), it is clear that the expression for the
ﬂux can be rewritten as
r2 f (r) = −D ϕ e−Λ eΛ .

(13)

Inserting this expression in (12) and once more integrating we obtain the following expression for the ﬂux f (re ):
r2 f (re ) = r2 f (h) (re ) + r2 f (i) (re ),

(14a)

r2 f (h) (re ) = − e−Λ(rE ) ϕE − e−Λ(rC ) ϕC

where r2 f (h) (re ) and r2 f (i) (re ) are the homogeneous and inhomogeneous
part, corresponding to the homogeneous and particular solution of (8), respectively.
We introduce some notation. a, b denotes the usual inner product of two
functions a(r) and b(r) deﬁned on (rC , rE ), i.e.,
rE

a, b :=

a(r)b(r) dr.

see Figure 1. For the constant coeﬃcient homogeneous ﬂux, i.e., Γ (r) and M
constant on (rC , rE ), we introduce the notation
˜ e /Δr, Pe ; ϕC , ϕE ,
(r2 f (h) )(re ) = F h D

(20)

˜ e /Δr and Pe and
to denote the dependence of (r2 f (h) )(re ) on the parameters D
on the function values ϕC and ϕE . In the general case, when Γ (r) is an arbitrary
function of r, we can rewrite the homogeneous ﬂux in (14b) as
ˆ e /Δr, λ, 1 ; ϕC , ϕE .
r2 f (h) (re ) = F h D

(21)

˜ e and Pe
Thus, the ﬂux can be written as the constant coeﬃcient ﬂux with D
ˆ
replaced by De and λ, 1 , respectively.

Next, consider the inhomogeneous ﬂux. Assume ﬁrst that λ(r) = Const on
(rC , rE ) and deﬁne P := λΔr. Substituting the expression for S(r) in (14c) and
changing the order of integration, we ﬁnd the following alternative representation
for the inhomogeneous ﬂux

r2 f (i) (re ) =

G(σ(r); P ) r2 s(r) dr,

σ(r) :=

where σ(r) is the normalized coordinate on (rC , rE ) and where G(σ; P ) is the
Green’s function for the ﬂux. It is given by

see Figure 2. Note that G(σ; P ) relates the ﬂux to the source term and is diﬀerent
from the usual Green’s function, which relates the solution to the source term.
If we furthermore assume that s(r) = Const on (rC , rE ), relation (22) reduces to
r2 f (i) (re ) = Δr

(25)

see Figure 3. From both ﬁgures, it is clear that the inhomogeneous ﬂux is only
of importance for advection dominated ﬂow, i.e., |P |
1, in combination with a
large source term and in this case the upwind value sC for s(r) should be taken.

Fig. 3. The weighting function W (z)

For arbitrary functions Γ (r) and s(r) we have a similar representation for the
inhomogeneous ﬂux, i.e.,

r2 f (i) (re ) =

G(σ(r); λ, 1 ) r2 s(r) dr,

(26a)

with G(σ; P ) deﬁned in (23) and where the normalized coordinate σ(r) is deﬁned
by

σ(r) :=

Note that λ(r) > 0 implying that σ(r) is a monotonically increasing function on
(rC , rE ). Expanding s(r) in a Taylor series, we can also evalute the integral in
(26a), to ﬁnd
r2 f (i) (re ) = Δr

(27)

Summarizing, we have the exact representation (21) for the homogeneous ﬂux
and the second order approximation (27) for the inhomogeneous ﬂux. Both exˆ e /Δr = M/ λ, 1 , the inner
pressions hold for arbitrary Γ (r) and s(r). Since D
product λ, 1 is the only integral that remains to be approximated. Straightforward integration and applying the mean value theorem of integration gives
λ, 1 =

r∗ ∈ (rC , rE ).

(28)

Using the approximation Γ (r∗ ) = Γ˜e + O(Δr) we obtain λ, 1 = P˜e + O(Δr2 ).
Inserting this approximations in the expressions (21) and (27) and omitting
O(Δr2 )-terms we obtain the following result for the numerical ﬂux:

Numerical Schemes and Example

Combining the expressions (29) for the numerical ﬂux with the discrete conservation law (7) we can derive two numerical schemes, i.e., the complete ﬂux
(CF) scheme and the homogeneous ﬂux (HF) scheme, for which we only take
into account the homogeneous part of the ﬂux. We apply these schemes to a
model BVP to investigate their performance for both diﬀusion dominated and
advection dominated ﬂow.
Substituting (29) in (7) we obtain the numerical scheme

For the HF scheme we have to take bW,j = bC,j = 0. Note that both schemes
gives rise to a tridiagonal system Aϕ = Bs, which can be very eﬃciently solved
using LU-decomposition.
Consider the following BVP

Γ (r) = Γmin ( 1 +

r ),

s(r) =

smax

1 + smax (2r − 1)2

(31c)

The diﬀusion coeﬃcient Γ (r) is a smoothly varying function whereas the source
term has a sharp peak, introducing a steep interior layer near r = 12 ; see Figure 4.
To assess the order of accuracy of both schemes, we compute numerical approximations of ϕ( 12 ) with increasingly smaller grid sizes and apply Richardson
extrapolation to these results. More precisely, let
ϕ( 12 ) = ϕh + εh = ϕh/2 + εh/2 = ϕh/4 + εh/4 ,

h = Δr,

(32)

where ϕh denotes the numerical approximation of ϕ( 12 ) computed with grid
size h and εh the corresponding (global) discretisation error, etc. Assuming the
following expansion
(33)
εh = Chp + O(hq ), q > p,
we can derive the following expression for the order of accuracy p:

In Table 1 you ﬁnd the values of q h for both schemes. Clearly, when diﬀusion
is dominant, i.e., for Γmin = 10−1 , both schemes behave second order accurate. Thus both schemes perform equally well, in agreement with the previous
observation that the inhomogeneous ﬂux is only of importance for advection
dominated ﬂow. On the other hand, for dominant advection, i.e., Γmin = 10−7
the homogeneous ﬂux scheme reduces to ﬁrst order, whereas the complete ﬂux
scheme is still second order.

Conclusions and Future Research

In this paper we have derived the complete ﬂux scheme for spherically symmetric conservation laws of advection-diﬀusion-reaction type. The numerical ﬂux is
computed from a local BVP for the entire equation, including the source term.
All parameters are assumed to be arbitrary, suﬃciently smooth functions of the
radial coordinate r. As a result, the numerical ﬂux is the superposition of a
homogeneous ﬂux, corresponding to the homogeneous solution of the BVP, and
an inhomogeneous ﬂux, corresponding to the particular solution. The resulting
scheme behaves second order accurate, uniformly in the Peclet number, does not

introduces numerical oscillations near a steep layer and has a simple three-point
stencil.
Directions for further research are the following. A ﬁrst obvious extension is
to apply the scheme to time dependent conservation laws. An option would be
to include the time derivative in the inhomogeneous ﬂux and subsequently apply
a suitable time integration method. A second extension is to apply the scheme
to the conservation laws of a spherically symmetric ﬂame. Since our model BVP
has an interior layer reminiscent of a ﬂame front, it is expected that the CFscheme will give accurate results for laminar ﬂames. The major problem in this
case is to construct fast and robust iterative methods to solve the nonlinear,
discrete system. A ﬁnal extension the authors have in mind is to simulate time
dependent, i.e., expanding or imploding, spherical ﬂames. All these issues will
be subject of future research.
