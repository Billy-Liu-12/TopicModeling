Abstract
Explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method has been widely used for seismic modeling in heterogeneous
media with strong discontinuities in physical properties. In such cases, due to stability considerations, the time step size is primarily determined by the medium with higher wave speed
propagation, resulting that the higher the speed, the lower the time step needs to be to ensure
stability throughout the whole domain. Therefore, the use of diﬀerent temporal discretizations
can greatly reduce the computational cost involved when solving this kind of problem. In this
paper we propose an algorithm for the local temporal discretization setting named Region Triangular Transition (RTT), which allows the local temporal discretizations to be related by any
integer value that enables these discretizations to operate at the stability limit of the ﬁnite
diﬀerence approximations used.
Keywords: ﬁnite diﬀerences, adjustable time-steps, time adaptivity, triangular transition region, acoustic wave equation

Introduction

The solution of wave propagation problems in continuous acoustic medium is of great interest in
various science areas, as in geophysics [2], in medicine and engineering, among others [7, 3, 8].
This problem is modeled by partial diﬀerential equations with appropriate known initial and
boundary conditions and in seismic applications, for example, we have heterogeneous domain,
with variable wave propagation velocity.
Explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence method is often used to ﬁnd numerical solution of this problem and
in this case, the spatial discretization is related to the shortest wavelength to be captured and
temporal discretization is determined by the stability condition of the ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme

employed. To ensure the solution stability in the whole domain, time discretization is limited
by the worst situation which leads to the use of the lower time step.
As stability analysis consider only homogeneous domains, it is expected that the subregions
with smaller propagation speeds allow the use of less reﬁned temporal discretizations. For
problems involving large domains such as occurs in seismic analysis, the use of locally adjusted
time steps can provide savings in the total computational time processing.
In 1998, Falk et al. [4] proposed an algorithm for local time step adjustment for the elastic
wave equation solution where the time steps needed to be proportional to 2n , being n an
integer value. Subsequently a new algorithm was proposed [9] extending this proportional
limiting relationship to any integer value n. Despite these proposed formulations work well
in heterogeneous domains, reducing the computing eﬀort [6], the appearance of a noise in the
signal wave is identiﬁed in simulations where the time step is close to the method’s stability
threshold.
This paper proposes an algorithm for local time step setting, the Transition Region Triangular (RTT), that in addition to allowing the same relationships between temporal discretizations
as those proposed by Tessmer [9] eliminates the above cited undesirable eﬀects when working
near the stability limit of the ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations used.

Acoustic Wave Equation

The acoustic wave equation for a two-dimensional (2D) problem, deﬁned in the space domain
Ω ∈ R = {(x, y) | 0 ≤ x ≤ xn e 0 ≤ y ≤ yn } can be described as:
∂2u
− c2
∂t2

∂2u ∂2u

where u = u(x, y, t) is a function of space and time and c is the medium wave velocity propagation, together with initial conditions: u(x, y, 0) = f (x, y) and ∂u
∂t (x, y, 0) = g(x, y), ∀x, y ∈ Ω
and suitable boundary conditions.
For the two-dimensional acoustic wave, using temporal and spatial second order approximations (2-2) one obtain an explicit Finite Diﬀerence Method (FDM) with the following expression:
= 2uti,j + C 2 (uti+1,j − 2uti,j + uti−1,j + uti,j+1 − 2uti,j + uti,j−1 ) − ut−Δt

with C = c Δt

in directions x and y while Δt and h deﬁne time and spatial discretizations respectively, with
Δx = Δy = h. Next we can see in (Eq. 3) the expression of the explicit Finite Diﬀerence
Method when using time second order and spatial fourth order approximations (2-4).

Time Adaptivity

Time adaptivity algorithms use time increments that are adjusted depending on the medium,
employing intermediate time steps which satisfy stability limits on each subregion of the heterogeneous domain. The choice of these intermediate increments of time depends on the algorithm
used. For regions near where there are physical characteristics discontinuities, spatial derivatives approximations would have to be calculated by accessing mesh points of ﬁnite diﬀerences
that would not have their values deﬁned in the same instant of time due to use of diﬀerent
temporal discretizations. These values could be extrapolated from earlier times previously calculated values but this would cause a decrease in the accuracy of the numerical solution due to
the introduction of errors resulting from these interpolations. Thus, the algorithms presented
here use ﬁnite diﬀerences approximation with the same order. The way proposed to calculate
these values is that diﬀerentiate these algorithms. To do this the deﬁnition of a transition
region is needed, depending upon the considered method and on the order of the spatial ﬁnite
diﬀerence approximation used.
Falk et al. [4] propose an algorithm where the time increments need to be multiples of 2i ,
where i is a positive or negative integer. As an example, in Figure 1 it is shown a schematic of the
algorithm proposed by Falk et al. [4] for a one-dimensional domain composed of subregions with
propagations speeds V2 > V1 , where 2V1 < V2 ≤ 4V1 . In this ﬁgure we used time second order
and fourth order in space ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations. The discretization value Δt ensures
the stability for the subregion with the lowest propagation velocity (V1 ) and Δtmin ≤ Δt/4, for
the subregion where the velocity propagation is given by V2 . In this case is necessary to use an
intermediate time step (Δtint = Δt/2). In this ﬁgure points of the spatial mesh represented by
the white squares are calculated using the time discretization Δt/ 4, the black squares use Δt,
and triangles represent the transition zone used, containing calculated values with temporal
discretizations Δt/4 and Δt/2. This means that the adaptive algorithm for this case used
the following time increments: Δt, Δt/2 and Δt/4 (Figure 1). In this algorithm the only
possibility is the use of time increments multiple of 2n , with n an integer value (Δtn = Δt/2n ).
Besides that the proposed methodology varies for the diﬀerent choices of the increment values
combinations.
Tessmer [9] suggests a modiﬁcation to this algorithm which lets you use any previous time
discretization satisfying Δtsubreg = Δt/(i + 1), where i is a integer value (i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...).
This algorithm has a constant transition zone width, which varies only with the order of the
ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation used to approximate the spatial derivatives. Figure 2 shows the
scheme proposed by Tessmer for ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations of second order in time and
fourth order in space for a one-dimensional domain case. It is worth mentioning that also in
this case Δtmax = Δt and Δtmin = Δt/4. It can be observed in this ﬁgure that the values of
the transition zone, represented by triangles, are calculated with temporal discretizations Δt/4,
Δt/2 and 3Δt/4. The algorithms above described produce good results when discretizations
are used below the stability limit of the methods [4, 9, 1]. However, in these schemes noise
appear in the solution on the border of the region with physical discontinuity of the medium

when temporal discretizations are close to the stability limit of the method. These noises are
spread throughout the domain over time [1]. Its eﬀects are presented in Section 4.2.

Region Triangular Transition Algorithm (RTT)

This paper proposes a temporal adaptivity algorithm that enables the adoption of the same
subdivision of time steps presented by Tessmer in [9] but attenuates the undesirable eﬀects at
the interface where speeds change. Although with this scheme the transition region is enlarged,
it preserves the same discretization within a triangular region composed of all points that
are directly used in the calculation of the boundary value of each subregion. For the proposed
algorithm, the Region Triangular Transition (RTT), the values of the transition zone that are in
the triangular region are sequentially calculated, as shown in Figure 3 using the same temporal

discretization of the region with the highest propagation velocity, ie, Δtmin = Δt/4.

Figure 3: Triangular Scheme - 1D - approximations 2-4 - 4 subdivisions of time step.

Points of the transition zone which are calculated in the ﬁrst level of time t + Δt/4, require
values in two moments of earlier times and that are outside the triangular region (Figure 4).
Only those values of the transition region are calculated ΔT = 3Δt/4, as shown in Figure 5.

Even though this algorithm presents a larger transition region, it is possible to use values
of Δt near the stability limit.

Numerical Results

To show the results obtained with the proposed algorithm equation (4) is solved in a heterogeneous ﬁeld where the interface velocity discontinuity is at x = 3250m. In this example for the
subregion with the lowest propagation velocity it was taken V1 = 750m/s while for the greatest
velocity one has V2 = 4V1 . Initial condition is given by:
u(x, y, 0) =

e
12800π

−(x2 +y 2 )
12800

(4)

and ∂u
∂t (x, y, 0) = 0., ∀x, y. As boundary condition homogeneous Dirichlet is used, ie, u(Γ, t) =
0., t > 0, being Γ the boundaries of the considered domain, with x ∈ [0.; 6000.] and y ∈
[0.; 6000.].
Two types of comparisons are shown: (a) results of the adaptivity algorithm RTT against
the conventional method, with constant Δt, and reference results, presented in Antunes [1]; (b)
results comparisons with other adaptivity schemes.

4.1

Comparing RTT Algorithm with Conventional Results

The conventional method, with constant Δt, was analized in Antunes [1] for diﬀerent spatial
and temporal discretizations, and for diﬀerent approximations orders of the Finite Diﬀerence
Method to give what we called here Reference Results. This result was compared with RTT
algorithm and with the conventional FDM for the same Courant number for the subregion with
the greatest wave propagation velocity. Figures 6 and 7 show these results in y = 3000m and
t = 0.90s for ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations second order time derivative and spatial fourth
order (2-4) with h = 10; 20 and 40 with C = 0.15 using conventional FDM taking this Courant
number for the subregion where the propagation velocity is V2 = 4V1 .
It can be seen, for all displayed graphics, that results by the algorithm here proposed
remain closer to that adopted as reference than those obtained with conventional methods.

It can be veriﬁed the emergence of a phenomenon here named noise. This term was used
since it smoothly grows with time unlike instabilities behavior which are of diﬀerent shape. This
noise begins nearby the velocity interface and spread with time for the whole domain when we
use Falk et al. [4] or Tessmer [9] algorithms close to the stability limit for the classical ﬁnite
diﬀerences. This kind of phenomenon appears even when these algorithms employ diﬀerent
orders of ﬁnite diﬀerence approximations.

Superposed on these graphs we still have plotted the numerical RTT result and it is worthy
to note that noise does not occur in the latter algorithm. Studies of the time variation of the
numerical solution spectrum may clarify the nature of this phenomenon.

Table 2: Simulations times - Four subdivisions of time step.
In this Section we present a short comparative study of the computing time involving the conventional algorithm(constant time-step) with those that use adaptivity(locally adjusted time-steps:
Falk et al. [4], Tessmer [9] and RTT [1].
Performance tests were executed in a machine with
the following basic conﬁguration: CPU: 1200MHz, cache size: 8192 KB and RAM memory:
8GB - Model name: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 860 Processor (8M Cache, 2,80 GHz). Depicted on Table 2 are the temporal discretizations used and respectives mean execuction times
for a problem whith a domain where the region with greater velocity needs, in the adaptive
algorithm, of four subdivisions for the time step. For the algorithm RTT one also show - as
RTT (Limit) - the results for temporal discretizations close to the stability limit.

Conclusions

Acoustic wave equation is used to model problems in several areas including seismic modeling.
In applications involving heterogeneous media, when using explicit ﬁnite diﬀerence methods,
one is forced to employ a constant time increment across the whole domain. This causes
oversampling for some regions requiring unnecessary extra computational eﬀort.
Algorithms that allow locally adjustable time steps for solving this problem can provide a
substantial reduction of this computational eﬀort, particularly when working with large problems and when large contrasts in the values of physical characteristics are present, as it often
happens in seismic analysis. These savings, which can reach considerable values, depend on the
adopted spatial discretization and on the ratio between the sizes of the subregions with diﬀerent
physical characteristics. However in those cases noise can appear close to the velocities interface
regions which forces these algorithms to work with time steps far from the stability limit.
In this paper we propose an robust and ﬂexible algorithm for time adaptivity, which allows the use of diﬀerent temporal discretizations that besides of consider more points in the
transition zone than those in the others proposed methods found in the literature allows the
635

Solving acoustic wave using adjustable time-steps

Antunes, Leal-Toledo, Silveira and Toledo

use, with precision, of time increments near the stability limit for the conventional scheme.
The ﬂexibility of the algorithm comes from that it always follows the same methodology for
diﬀerent temporal discretizations possibilities being of simple computational implementation,
even for more complex domains that can involve several values of time increments to be locally
adjusted. Besides that it can be easily extended to three-dimensional domains.
For practical purposes, the ratios between the wave propagation speeds on two neighbor
regions varies spatially according to the irregular boundaries between these two regions, as
often occurs in real situations. This could be a obstacle to the implementation of any time
adaptivity technique as here discussed. To overcome this diﬃculty a pre-processor is currently
being developed so we can have a kind of t ﬁeld over the whole integration domain such that
adaptivity obeying this new ﬁeld can straightforward run. Since usual applications on seismic
areas involve several experiments with the same domain, this t ﬁeld can be obtained only
once for all analyzes to be done which make this pre-processor an attractive feature.
A more profound study of phenomena that we called noise, whose absence is associated with
the good stability performance of the algorithm presented, would be interesting for posterior
developments.
