1 Introduction
Automatic personal identification of humans is a very essential for law enforcement, public places
such as airports and shopping complexes. Biometric-based identification is an effective technology for
personal verification and identification which makes it more popular [1, 2]. One of the robust biometrics
is palmprint. Palmprint is defined as the inner surface of a hand and acquiring it requires low-cost of
hardware and easy availability. It contains many stable and discriminative features, including principal
lines, wrinkles, abundant ridges, minutiae, and textural features [3]. Thus the palmprint-based
authentication approach is able to achieve reliable personal verification and identification. These
specifications make palmprint recognition approach interesting and various palmprint recognition
algorithms have been presented based on different kinds of palmprint features [3, 4].
According to the extracted features from palmprint, there are three categories for palmprint
recognition approaches: principal line extraction, subspace learning, and texture coding [1]. Early
palmprint recognition systems were based on edge detection and used principal line extraction [5, 6].
Due to the complexity of distinguishing the discrepancy between foreground and background in
palmprint images, the principal line feature is difficult to obtain sometimes. In subspace-based
approaches, the palmprint image is considered as the high-dimensional data and then mapped into a
lower dimensional space to achieve good representation and matching of palmprint images [7]. Texture
coding methods have higher recognition accuracy than the other methods. In texture coding methods,
palmprint images processed by different filters, and then the processed image is encoded with a binary
scheme [8-10].
In [11], textural information of palmprint are extracted using contourlet transform and nonsubsampled contourlet transform and employing a feature level fusion. In [12], Gabor wavelets were used
to decompose the palmprint images, and then neural network is employed to decompose each Gabor subband into a series of binary images. Entropies for these binary images are calculated and regarded as
features which are classified by support vector machine classifier. In [13], to increase to speed and reduce
the computational complexity, adaptive lifting wavelet scheme was used to decompose a palmprint image
into several sub-bands. The feature extraction and classification is the same as [12]. In [14], after
extracting region of interest (ROI), Gabor features, Gabor and wide principal line image features were
extracted from ROI. Dissimilarity distance is used to measure the dissimilarity between the test palmprint
and train palmprint images.
In this paper, we propose to use the histogram of BSIF codes of processed images by Gabor filters.
After extracting ROI) from palmprint, it is passed through Gabor filters with different wavelengths and
orientations. BSIF is a local texture descriptor which is based on independent component analysis and
efficient scalar quantization scheme [15]. Hence, in this paper, we use BSIF to extract efficient texture
features from ROI of palmprint. In this way, BSIF code of outputs of Gabor filters are computed and then
we combine them together to obtain final BSIF code. When the final BSIF code is obtained, histogram
of it is obtained and them features of histogram are given to KNN classifier to perform personal
identification. Experimental results of PolyU database demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
the higher results than the recently proposed algorithms.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the proposed palmprint recognition
method. Section III contains the experimental results, and finally Section IV concludes the paper.

2 Proposed Palmprint Recognition Method
In this section, we explain the proposed personal identification based on palmprint recognition. The
main steps of the proposed method are as following.
1. Extract ROI
2. Pass ROI through Gabor filters

2.1 Extract ROI
As mentioned, in this research palmprint images from frequently used PolyU database are used. As
shown in Figure 1, background pixels of all images has very low intensity values. Hence, all parts of
palmprint image are not suitable for identification. Previous researches have showed that most
significance part of palmprint is in center of palmprint.
Therefore, at first significance part of palmprint must be extracted. In this work, we use the algorithm
presented in [16] to extract the ROI from palmprint.
Extracted ROIs have different sizes, therefore, we must resize them to have the same size. Here, we
resize the extracted ROIs to 128×128 pixels using bi-cubic interpolation.

2.2 Pass ROI through Gabor filters
Since characteristics of certain cells in the visual cortex of some mammals can be approximated by
Gabor filters, these filters have received considerable attention in image processing filed. Also, since
these filters can posse optimal localization properties in both spatial and frequency domain, they are
well suited for texture segmentation problems. A Gabor filter can be viewed as a sinusoidal plane of
particular frequency and orientation, modulated by a Gaussian envelope. It can be written as:

G  x, y ,  ,   

j 2  x cos  y sin  

where σ and θ denote the bandwidth and orientation of Gabor filter, respectively, and j
As seen Gabor filter is complex, therefore, the output of its output also complex, and magnitude and
phase of output images should be used. In this paper, we use the phase of Gabor-filtered palmprint

 , which

results in four Gabor filters and for each ROI, we obtain for phase images. In Figure 2, for typical
palmprint, the phase of outputs of Gabor filters are shown.

2.3 Compute BSIF of outputs of filtered palmprints
BSIF is an efficient method for constructing local image descriptors which efficiently encode texture
information. These descriptors are suitable for histogram based representation of image regions. In this
method, for each pixel a binary code is computed by linearly projecting local image patches onto a
subspace. The value of each bit in binary code string is computed by binarizing the response of a linear
filter with a threshold at zero. Each bit is associated with a different filter and the desired length of the
bit string determines the number of filters used [15].
In this paper, we use BSIF to extract features from outputs of Gabor filter. The BSIF code for phase
of outputs of Gabor filters are computed which are shown in Figure 3. In this way, 4 codes are computed
for the phases of outputs of Gabor filter. Then, codes are combined together linearly with equal weights
and then normalized to obtain final BSIF code for phase of outputs of Gabor filters. The final BSIF code
are shown in Figure 4.

2.4 Obtain histogram features of final BSIF code
After that final BSIF code was obtained, its normalized histogram is computed which is shown in
Figure 5.

There are several methods to compare the histograms. In this paper, we extract six features from
histogram including mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis, energy, and entropy, which are calculated as:

where X denotes final BSIF code, N is the number of histogram bins, xi is the ith bin of histogram and
Px denotes normalized value (probability density) corresponds to ith histogram bin. Therefore, each
palmprint is characterized with six features. These features are given to KNN classifier.

2.5 Recognize palmprint using KNN classifier
The purpose of the KNN algorithm is to use a database in which the data points are separated into
several separate classes to predict the classification of a new sample point.
The following steps are performed by KNN classifier to classify test samples:
1. A positive integer K is specified.
2. The K entries in database are selected which are closest to the test sample based on Euclidean
distance. This distance between train sample x and test sample y with 6 features is calculated as:
D
E  x, y 

  xk  y k 

(8)

k 1

3. The labels (class) of K-nearest neighbors in train samples are extracted. The test sample y is assigned
to the class that have maximum samples among K-nearest samples.
It can be seen that performance of the KNN classifier depends on value K. Therefore, in this paper,
we obtain the performance of the proposed algorithm for different values of K and the highest
performance is chosen as performance of the proposed identification algorithm.

3 Experimental Result
In order to evaluate the performance of proposed algorithm, we use well-known Hong Kong
Polytechnic University (PolyU) palmprint database [17]. This database contains 7752 gray-scale images
corresponding to 386 different palms in BMP image format. Around twenty samples from each of these
palms were collected in two sessions, where around 10 samples were captured in the first session and
the second session, respectively. The average interval between the first and the second collection was
two months. The resolution of all the original palmprint images is 384×284 pixels at 75 dpi.
Since we should compare the performance of the proposed method with recently introduced
methods, the selected images should be same as those methods. We compare the proposed method with
introduced methods in [11], [12], [13], [14]. In [11] and [14], the first two palmprint images in the first
session and first palmprint image in the second session of every palm were considered as the training
palmprint images, all the palmprint images of all the palm were considered as the testing palmprint
images. This data set is denoted as set I. In [12], [13] and [14], the first five palmprint images of every
palm in the first session were considered as the training palmprint images and the left over images of
the first session were considered as the testing palmprint images. The number of training palmprint
images are 1930 and the number of testing palmprint images are 1959. This data set is denoted as set II.
In Figure 6, the correct classification rate (CCR) of the proposed method for different values of K of
KNN classifier in data sets I and II are shown. It is observed that K = 1 achieves the highest CCR in
both sets. Hence, the performance of the proposed algorithm in data set I is 99.27% and in data set II is
99.81%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed personal identification algorithm.

In Table I, we compare the performance of the proposed algorithm with recently introduced methods.
It is observed that proposed algorithm outperforms the recently introduced or have near CCR to them.
Therefore, proposed method can be used in personal identification systems.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, the new method was presented for personal identification based on palmprint. To this
end, at first ROI of acquired palmprint was extracted and then was given to Gabor filter bank consists
of four filters. To extract textural information from phases, we used BSIF code. The four BSIF codes
are linearly combined together with equal weights to obtain final BSIF code. Then, the normalized
histogram of BSIF code was obtained and six features from histogram were extracted. Finally, KNN
classifier was used to personal identification. Results show that proposed algorithm achieves the higher
performance in palmprint identification.
