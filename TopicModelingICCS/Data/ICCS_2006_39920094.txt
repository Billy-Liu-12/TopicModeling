Abstract. Large artiﬁcial Hodgkin-Huxley neural networks are examined. The structures discussed in this article simulate the cortex of the
mammalian visual system. We use a modular architecture of the cortex
divided into sub-regions. Results of parallel simulations based on the liquid computing theory are presented in some detail. Separation ability of
groups of neural microcircuits is observed. We show that such property
may be useful for explaining some edge or contrast detection phenomena.

Introduction

The human brain and its cortex are probably the most complex systems known.
A structure built of about 1011 interacting neural cells is always a hard object
for simulation, even for the fastest super-computers. A new idea of brain modelling was suggested by Maass [1] and since then it has been called Liquid State
Machine (LSM) [2]. In general, the brain (or its fragment) is treated as a liquid.
The cortex is built of neurons organised in microcircuits [3] which form columns
and the function of each column depends on its location in the brain. Cortical
microcircuits turn out to be very good ”liquids” for computing on perturbations. They are characterised by the large diversity of their elements, neurons,
synapses, the large variety of mechanisms and time constants characterising their
interactions, involving recurrent connections on multiple spatial scales. Like the
Turing machine, the model of LSM is based on a strict mathematical framework
that guarantees, under ideal conditions, universal computational power [1]. Applying ideas of liquid computing [1] allows to decrease the number of neurons
in the constructed model. In addition, the simulation time can be dramatically
shortened using cluster-based parallelised simulations of groups of microcircuits.
It has been discovered that simple cells in cat’s primary visual cortex (V1)
are specialised for the orientation of light and dark borders [4]. The orientation
selectivity of simple cells in V1 comes from an oriented arrangement of the input
from the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei (LGN). Namely, ON-centre LGN inputs have
receptive ﬁelds centres aligned over simple cell’s ON sub-regions, and similarly
for OFF-centre inputs [5]. Some observations of monkey cortex suggest that the
microstructure of V1 is spatially periodic [6]. Thanks such architecture many

phenomena of signal processing occurring in visual systems can be explained.
Visual pathway and detailed description of ON-OFF centres can be found elsewhere [7].
In this paper we present some results of mammalian visual cortex simulations.
We prove that our model can help to understand some edge or contrast detection
phenomena.

The Model of Mammalian Visual System

Discussed model of mammalian visual system consists of two main modules
(Fig. 1). Because the idea of LSM calls for such an architecture, our model includes ”Input” (Retina) and ”Liquid” (Cortex) [1]. All simulations discussed in
this paper are conducted in parallel version of GENESIS for MPI environment
(for parallelisation eﬀectiveness, time of typical runs and other detail see Appendix A). Neurons used in the simulations are built according to the HodgkinHuxley model [8] and are relatively simple (for detail see Appendix B).

Input Device (Retina)

Liquid (Cortex)

Fig. 1. The model of simulated visual system. The arrows represent connections of
HHLSM columns (for detail see text).

The Retina is built on 16 × 16 square-shaped grid and divided into 16 patches
(4 × 4). Each patch is connected with one of 16 HHLSM (Hodgkin- Huxley
Liquid State Machine) columns which simulate LGN and the ensemble of cortical
microcircuits (retinal cells are connected only with LGN). HHLSM consists of
1024 cells put on a 8 × 8 × 16 grid. There are layers arranged in each column
(Fig. 2) and the set of columns simulates the Liquid. There are 80% of excitatory
connections established among layers and neurons of each layer and 20% of
inhibitory connections. In addition, layers L6 of some columns are connected
with LGNs of other HHLSMs in the same way, simulating the corticothalamic
feedback. Intercolumn connections are presented in Fig. 1. Each connection in
the model is characterised with some ”delay” parameter and random weight.
The thick arrows in Fig. 1 represent connections with short delays (d1 = 10−4 s)
and the thin arrows correspond to connections with long delays (d2 = 10−3 s).
We choose such topology to model ON and OFF-centre subregions of V1. We
can treat the ”Liquid” as a hypercolumn in some part of periodic structure of
the cortex.

Such a model can be easily scaled into multiprocessor simulation. In discussed
research each column and its corresponding retinal patches should be simulated
on one node. It should be noted that 16 processors were required for the best
realisation of the model and additional one for the simulation control. However,
the Retina may be easily divided into 4 (2 × 2), 64 (8 × 8) or 256 (16 × 16)
patches, depending on the number of processors available. Thus, if each patch is
connected with corresponding HHLSM column - it should be possible to conduct
a simulation of about 256 thousands Hodgkin-Huxley neural cells.

Simulation and Results

We investigated the model consisting of 16640 neurons (as the Liquid is simulated by the ensemble of 16 HHLSM columns). Twelve patterns were arranged
on the Input Device (Fig. 3). Retinal cells chosen for each pattern were then
stimulated with random spike trains. The input signal was encoded in Liquid’s
state. We deﬁne the state of the Liquid by a multidimensional vector with binary coordinates 0 for a ”sleeping neuron” and 1 for an ”active” neuron. The
”dead-state” corresponds to the Liquid with all neurons ”sleeping”.
We simulated 500 ms of biological work of our system. The main objective of
current research was to check the Euclidean distance of states of the liquid for
diﬀerent couples of input patterns.
The results conﬁrm liquid computing abilities of neural microcircuits. In each
case a meaningful diﬀerence in states of the liquid was observed for diﬀerent

spike trains stimulating even the same retinal pattern (Fig. 4). It is usually a
very typical behaviour for LSM. However, Maass’ LSM has been built of integrate
and ﬁre neurons, while our structure consists of much more biologically realistic
Hodgkin- Huxley neural cells. Additionally, for the states of two geometrically
diﬀerent input patterns even larger ”distance of liquids” was observed (Fig. 5).
In general, we can divide the set of input patterns into three groups: the
Retina for patterns 1 − 4 (group 1) has ON-centre receptive ﬁelds stimulated,
patterns 9−12 (group 2) stimulate the OFF-centre sub-regions and patterns 5−8
(group 3) send impulses both to ON and OFF-centre patches of the Input Device.
Figs. 6-8 present the state of liquids measured as the distance from the so-called
”dead state” (liquid is in the ”dead-state” when nothing is stimulating its cells).
One can note diﬀerent tendencies for each of three pattern groups. In Figs. 67 we present typical plots from pattern group 1 and 2 respectively. Network’s
architecture implies such behaviour: large delays in OFF-centre V1 microcircuits

cause more action spike potentials in the late phases of simulations. In addition,
for patterns from the 2nd group we obtain activity of both ON and OFF-central
HHLSMs. Fig. 8 shows characteristics for patterns 7 and 12. It should be noted
that 12th pattern belongs to the 3rd group. In this case only the OFF-centre
area of the cortex is stimulated and whole liquid activity is relatively smaller.
The distance curve in Figs. 6-8 goes down after 475 ms as result of intended
and decreased retinal activity in the end of simulation. In the case of simulations
longer than 500 ms the typical behaviour (like from 100 ms - 400 ms parts of
the plots) was observed.
Following Maass’ [1] ideas and applying a readout for liquid state analysis we
can imagine some expert-devices able to classify ON and OFF-central patterns.
Implementing diﬀerent delays for connections and arranging a proper architecture of the simulated cortex can then lead to a better understanding of, for
example, contrast or edge detection phenomena.

Conclusions

In this paper we report results of the mammalian visual cortex’ simulations. We
simulated about 16 thousands Hodgkin-Huxley neurons organised in layers and
cortical microcircuits. Some biologically-inspired topology was arranged. The
results prove that such organisation of the cortex has good separation ability
characteristic for LSM and model used for this article can explain some natural
pattern recognition phenomena.
The modular structure of visual cortex makes possible the application of good
parallelisation as particular microcircuits can be simulated on separate nodes.
Our model is scalable and we can easily increase the number of neurons in each
cortical column which will let us run simulations consisting of more than 256
thousands Hodgkin-Huxley neurons. This will help us build more realistic model
of visual cortex. Most of the discussed simulations were conducted on the local
cluster. Our machine is part of the CLUSTERIX grid project [10]. With access
to 800 processors and by increasing the number of simulated microcircuits a
structure consisting of several millions of neural cells simulated in a similar way
can be imagined. This could lead to the creation of very sophisticated models
and such possibility can open for us quite new ﬁeld of computational complex
systems’ research.

Appendix A: Details of Simulations’ Hardware and
Software Environment
The local cluster used for all simulations and discussed in this contribution was
built of 12 machines and 1 additional machine - the so-called ”access node”.
Each SMP machine had two 64-bit 1.4 GHz Itanium2 IA64 processors with 4
GB of RAM memory. The cluster works under control of Debian Linux Sarge
(v. 3.1) and 2.6.8-1 kernel version. The model is simulated in GEneral NEural
SImulation System GENESIS v.2.2.1 with its MPI extension. A gcc compiler
was used for the general system conﬁguration.
The length of a typical run was about 3000 s. The problem was parallelised
for 17 nodes. Some benchmarking was done for the parallelisation. The speedup
of 11 − 12 if compared to 1 − 2 processor runs was obtained.

Our HHLSMs consist of multicompartmental neurons with two dendrite compartments, a soma, and an axon. The dendrites contain synaptically activated

channel and the soma has voltage activated Hodgkin-Huxley sodium and potassium channels. The behaviour of each compartment is equivalent to the behaviour of some electrical circuit [9]. Thus, each circuit is characterised by a
typical for GENESIS group of parameters set as follows: resistances Ra = 0.3 Ω,
Rm = 0.33 Ω, capacity Cm = 0.01 F, and potential Em = 0.07 V. For the
soma compartment Ek = 0.0594 V whilst for the dendrite Ek = 0.07 V. Conductance for each type of ionic channels is chosen to be: GK = 360 Ω −1 and
GN a = 1200 Ω −1 . These parameters originate from neurophysiological experiments [9] and are chosen to make the model biologically more realistic. The
soma has a circular shape with the diameter of 30 μm, while dendrites and axon
are cable like with the length of 100 μm. All the other parameters are chosen
as suggested by GENESIS authors to simulate the behaviour of the biologicallike neurons [9]. More details concerning Hodgkin-Huxley model can be found
elsewhere [8].
