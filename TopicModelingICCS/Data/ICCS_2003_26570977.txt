Abstract. A boundary condition for temperature and heat ﬂux of a
thermal lattice Boltzmann method is presented. A thermal lattice BGK
model with doubled populations is used to simulate hydrodynamic and
thermal ﬁelds for ﬂows with viscous heating. The unknown thermal distribution functions at the boundary are assumed to be equilibrium distribution functions with a counter-slip internal energy density which is
determined consistently with Dirichlet and/or Neumann boundary conditions.

Introduction

In the last decade lattice kinetic theory, and most notably the Lattice Boltzmann method (see references [1] - [3]), have met with signiﬁcant success for the
numerical simulation of a large variety of athermal ﬂuid ﬂows, including realworld engineering applications. The simulation of ﬂows with signiﬁcant heat
transfer turned out to be much more diﬃcult (see reference [4],[5]). However, in
the recent time a number of proposals have appeared (for a review see reference
[3], Chapter 14, and reference [6], [7]). Some of these proposals are based on
the idea of dispensing with the explicit representation of heat ﬂux in terms of
kinetic moments of the particle distribution function f (x, v, t). This idea is interesting because the failure to reproduce the whole set of kinetic moments with
only a ﬁnite set of discrete speeds, is arguably the major source of numerical
instabilities of thermal lattice kinetic equations. In addition, the corresponding
lattices need a high number of discrete speeds, which can seriously impair the
implementation of boundary conditions, a vital issue for practical applications
(see references [8]-[12]). A successfull strategy consists of solving the temperature equation independently of LBE (see reference [6]) and couple to LBE by
expressing the ﬂuid pressure as the gradient of an external potential. Clearly,

this strategy represents a drastic departure from a fully kinetic approach, and
lacks some elegance. A more elegant possibility is to double the degrees of freedom and express thermal energy density and heat ﬂux as kinetic moments of a
separate ’thermal’ distribution g(x, v, t). The advantage of this latter approach
is that no kinetic moments beyond the ﬁrst order are ever needed, since heat ﬂux
is expressed as the ﬁrst order vector moment of g, the method is able to include
viscous heating eﬀects and boundary conditions are easily implemented because
both f and g live in the same lattice. The price to pay is doubling of the storage
requirements. The method has been successfully demonstrated for the case of
Couette ﬂow and Rayleigh-Benard convection (see reference [13]). The aim of
this paper is to show that the doubled-LBE, with the new boundary conditions
described in detail here, works over a pretty wide range of parameters and it can
be extended so as to support velocity-pressure boundary conditions, which are
of chief interest to practical engineering purposes.

The Thermal LBE Model

This paper regards the double-species LBE model proposed in reference [13].
In this model the (thermal) energy is represented by a separate distribution
function, g, which evolves concurrently with the standard particle distribution
function f . The distribution function f carries mass and momentum according
to the usual expressions:
ρ(x, t) =

f (x, v, t)dv ,

ρ(x, t)u(x, t) =

vf (x, v, t)dv

(1)

whereas the distribution function g is in charge of thermal energy density and
the corresponding heat ﬂux:
ρe(x, t) =

g(x, v, t)dv ,

q(x, t) =

v ¼ g(x, v, t)dv

(2)

where v ¼ = v − u is the peculiar speed of molecules relative to the ﬂuid ﬂow and
g (x, v, t) = 0.5| v ¼ |2 f (x, v, t).
The discrete distribution functions are postulated to obey a set of lattice
BGK equations of the form:
f˜i (x + ci dt, t + dt) − f˜i (x, t) = −
g˜i (x + ci dt, t + dt) − g˜i (x, t) = −

To improve the numerical stability, we use space-time independent average
values of T to calculate the local equilibria of f˜ (average thermohydrodynamic
consistency): c2s ∝ T¯ = const.
The kinetic viscosity and the thermal diﬀusivity are given by ν = τf RT¯ and
χ = 2τg RT¯ . Note that by going from fi to f˜i , ν has the same form in both
Navier-Stokes and energy equations .

Boundary Conditions

In previous works, diﬀerent types of boundary conditions are adopted for the
present model. In [13], the bounce-back rule of the nonequilibrium distribution
proposed by [15] is applied to the thermal population. In [16], the local thermal
equilibrium distribution functions are applied on the wall nodes in the case of

980

known temperature, while the energy distribution on the wall are set equal to
those of the nearest interior nodes in the case of adiabatic wall.
As proposed in [14] for the velocity boundary condition at the wall, the
”counter-slip” approach as applied to the internal energy, is adopted here. The
incoming unknown thermal populations are assumed to be equilibrium distribution functions with a counter-slip thermal energy e , which is determined so
that suitable constraints are veriﬁed, i.e. ﬁxed temperature or heat ﬂux. To explain the procedure, the following refers to a channel where the ﬂow is driven by
suitable boundary conditions and forcing terms applied to the populations f˜.
First, the case of a wall with a ﬁxed temperature is discussed. The unknown
distribution functions are (North wall, as an example) g˜↓ , g˜ and g˜ and they
are chosen as:
g˜i = ρ(e + e ) [corresponding form for equilibrium] , i =↓,

yields
ρe = 2ρe + 1.5dt

In the above, G is the sum of the known populations coming from the ﬂuid nodes
and the nearest wall nodes, while the component v of the velocity is zero at the
wall.
If the unknown distributions are g˜→ , g˜ and g˜ , as at the inlet section of the
channel, and a temperature proﬁle is imposed, the counter-slip thermal energy
is given by:

(17)
ρe =

2 + 3 uc + 3 uc2
where G is the sum of the known populations coming from the nearest ﬂuid
nodes.

Finally, the corners can be treated in a similar way and the counter slip

Numerical Results

To demonstrate the accuracy of the method with the present boundary condition,
results for Couette and Poiseuille thermal ﬂows are given; for details and more
extensive discussion, see reference [17]).
4.1

Thermal Couette Flow

A two-dimensional planar ﬂow with a hot wall at temperature TW = TN , moving
along the horizontal direction x at speed UW , is considered. The lower (south)
wall is at rest and at constant temperature TS . The walls are at a distance H.
The major control parameters are the Prandtl number P r = ν/χ and the Eckert
number Ec = U 2 /cv ∆T , constructed with a characteristic velocity. The eﬀects
of viscous heating are controlled by the Brinkman number Br = P r Ec, representing the ratio between viscous dissipation and heat condution. The analytical
solution for the temperature ﬁeld is:
T (y) = TS +

At inlet and outlet sections periodic boundary conditions for both populations f˜ and g˜ are used. The wall speed UW has been imposed by means of a
pair of self-consistent reﬂection/slip coeﬃcients r, s as follows:
f˜↑ = f˜↓ ,

f˜ = rf˜ + sf˜

The wall temperature TN has been imposed by means of the correction (16). The
Reynolds number is constructed with H and UW and the average temperature
used in particle equilibria is T¯ = TS + TN /2. Several tests (not shown here)

have been performed with τf and τg ranging from 0.05 to 5.0. Satisfactory results
are obtained in all cases. The Figure 1 shows normalized temperature proﬁles,
as compared with analytical solutions, for ﬂows with moderate viscous heating
(Br = 0.9) and signiﬁcant viscous heating (Br = 2.93). the relative error is
3.4 × 10−4 in the ﬁrst case (∆T = 1.0) and 1.1 × 10−3 in the second (∆T = 9.0),
even with a signiﬁcant value of UW .

Thermal Poiseuille Flow

A two dimensional planar ﬂow driven by a constant pressure gradient dP/dx,
with the walls at rest and at constant temperature TW , is considered. Uniform velocity and temperature proﬁles UI and TI , at the inlet section, and thermally fully developed ﬂow, at the outlet section, are imposed. The constant
pressure gradient ∆P/L is simulated by means of a constant volumetric forcing
Fpois = 8ρ0 νUM /H 2 . The analytical solution for the temperature ﬁeld (stationary developed solution) is obtained from Navier-Stokes and energy equations for
incompressible ﬂows in the limit Re → 0. It reads as follows:

(28)

With respect to the thermal ﬁeld, the condition (16) is applied to the north wall
and a similar constraint holds for the south case; the condition (17) to the inlet
section, and the condition (19) to the outlet, are applied. The corners are treated
with similar procedure as in (22).
A 1281 × 65 grid, corresponding to an aspect ratio A = 20.0, is used with
τf = τg = 0.5, UM = 0.1, UI = 0.2/3.0, TI = 10.0 and TW = 1.0. The Reynolds
number constructed with mean velocity and hydraulic diameter is Re = 51.21
and the average temperature used in particle equilibria is T¯ = TI + TW /2.
The Figure 2 reports the normalized transverse temperature proﬁle and shows
satisfactory agreement for the ﬂuid temperature in the ﬁnal section of the channel, where the maximum relative error is 1.6 × 10−4 ; at the internal section, the
eﬀect of the high inlet temperature is still present.
In Figure 3 are shown results for the normalized transversal heat ﬂux proﬁle
at x/L = 0.875, as compared with analytical results. Again, fairly satisfactory
agreement is observed.
Finally, in the case of cooling without viscous heating, the analytical value
of the local Nusselt number, corresponding to a hydrodynamically fully developed ﬂow, is N ux = 7.54. This is deﬁned as N ux = hx D/k, where hx is the
local convection conductance, D is the hydraulic diameter and k is the thermal
conductivity, and is obtained as an inﬁnite-series-solution (see reference [18],

984

A. D’Orazio and S. Succi

Chapters 7 and 9). In excellent agreement with this value, N ux = 7.56 is obtained in the thermal fully developed region.
We have to point out that these results are obtained for τf = 0.5. For diﬀerent
values, the temperature proﬁle shows a departure from the analytical solution
at the outlet section. We veriﬁed that is due to the eﬀect of the non-uniform
velocity proﬁle into the equilibria of g˜. For the case of the natural convection
in a cavity or the Couette ﬂow described in section 4.1, satisfactory results are
obtained for τf and τg as low as 0.05.

Conclusions

Summarizing, the implementation of a suitable set of boundary conditions for
thermal Lattice Boltzmann schemes with doubled populations has been discussed. This study shows that:
1) The doubled thermal scheme provides reliable results over a wide range
of physical parameters, including situations with strong temperature contrasts
and/or signiﬁcant viscous heating eﬀects.
2) A new type of boundary condition for the temperature provides good
results for both Dirichlet and Neumann conditions.
3) By applying a hybrid set of boundary conditions, in which the ﬂow is forced
by a volumetric source of momentum, and still imposing the inlet velocity proﬁle,
the method can be adapted to situations of engineering interest.
4) Work is in progress to improve the results for the case of non-uniform
velocity proﬁle at the domain boundaries.
