Abstract
American options can be priced by solving linear complementary problems (LCPs) with
parabolic partial(-integro) diﬀerential operators under stochastic volatility and jump-diﬀusion
models like Heston, Merton, and Bates models. These operators are discretized using ﬁnite
diﬀerence methods leading to a so-called full order model (FOM). Here reduced order models (ROMs) are derived employing proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and non negative
matrix factorization (NNMF) in order to make pricing much faster within a given model parameter variation range. The numerical experiments demonstrate orders of magnitude faster
pricing with ROMs.
Keywords: reduced order model, option pricing, American option, linear complementary problem

Introduction

European options can be exercised only at expiry while American options can be exercised
anytime until expiry. Due to this additional ﬂexibility the American options can be more
valuable and in order to avoid arbitrage the value must be always at least the same as the ﬁnal
payoﬀ function. The seminal paper [6] by Black and Scholes models the value of underlying
asset as a geometrical Brownian motion with a constant volatility. Since then it has become
evident that more generic models are required for this value. Merton proposed adding lognormally distributed jumps to this model [19]. Heston [12] made the volatility to be a mean
reverting stochastic process. Bates [4] combined the Heston stochastic volatility model and
Merton jump-diﬀusion model.
The European options can be priced by solving a parabolic partial(-integro) diﬀerential
equation. The American options lead to LCPs with the same operator. These operators are two
dimensional with a stochastic volatility and one dimensional otherwise. The potential integral

part of the model results from the jumps. For American options ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations
lead to solving a discrete LCP at each time step. Eﬃcient numerical methods for American
options have been considered in [11, 13] for stochastic volatility models and in [9, 17, 25, 26, 28]
for jump-diﬀusion models. Methods for the combined Bates model have been developed in
[3, 27, 28, 31].
Unfortunately, high-ﬁdelity simulations are still too expensive for many practical applications and reduced order modeling (ROM) is a promising tool for signiﬁcantly alleviating computational costs [1, 5]. Most existing ROM approaches are based on projection. In projectionbased reduced order modeling the state variables are approximated in a low-dimensional subspace. Basis for this subspace are typically constructed by Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
(POD) [29] of a set of high-ﬁdelity solution snapshots. In the case where the governing equations include a constraint equation it is often beneﬁcial to construct a basis that satisﬁes these
constraints a priori [7]. For example, in the case of non-negativity constraints, a non-negative
basis can be constructed via non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) [2]. Finally, projecting
the high-ﬁdelity model using a Galerkin or Petrov-Galerkin projection yields ROMs capable of
delivering new solutions at a fraction of the computational costs of the high-ﬁdelity model.
For pricing European options ROMs have been developed in [8, 23]. Only recently ROMs
have been applied for pricing American options in [7, 10].
A common problem associated to option pricing is the calibration of model parameters to
correspond to the market prices of options. This is typically formulated as a least squares -type
optimization problem. The calibration is computationally expensive as it requires pricing a large
number of options with varying parameters. The use of ROMs to reduce this computational
cost has been studied in [20, 22, 21].

In the following, put options are considered. Their value at the expiry is given by the pay-oﬀ
function g(s) = max{K − s, 0}. Thus, the initial condition reads
u(s) = g(s)

and

u(s, v) = g(s)

(4)

for one-dimensional and two-dimensional models, respectively.
Due early exercise possibility the price u of an American option satisﬁes the LCP

− Lu = λ,

u ≥ g,

λ ≥ 0,

λ(u − g) = 0,

(5)

where the operator L is either LM or LB depending on the model and λ is a Lagrange multiplier;
see [14], for example. For computing an approximate solution the inﬁnite domain is truncated
at s = smax and v = vmax , where smax and vmax are suﬃciently large so that the error due to
truncation is negligible. Dirichlet boundary conditions for American put options are
u = K at s = 0

u = 0 at s = smax ,

and

(6)

on the left and right boundaries, respectively. Under the stochastic volatility models, the
Neumann boundary condition ∂u
∂v = 0 is posed at v = vmax . At v = 0 it is not necessary to
pose a boundary condition. For the numerical solution, the LCP is formulated for w = u − g
instead of u as the positivity constraint w ≥ 0 is more easily treated. This leads to the LCP

A quadratic penalty formulation is obtained by choosing the Lagrange multiplier to be

The spatial partial derivatives with respect to v are discretized using the above central ﬁnite

diﬀerence. A nine-point ﬁnite diﬀerence stencil for ∂s∂v
is obtained by employing the central
ﬁnite diﬀerences in both directions. The integrals can be discretized using a second-order
accurate quadrature formula. Here the linear interpolation is used for w between grid points
and exact integration; see [24], for details. Under the Merton model the discretization of the
integral leads to a full matrix while under the Bates model it leads to full diagonal blocks.
Under models without jumps the time discretization is performed by taking the ﬁrst time
steps using the implicit Euler method and after using the second-order accurate BDF2 method.
Under jump models the integral is treated explicitly. In the ﬁrst time step using the explicit
Euler method and in the following time steps using the linear extrapolation based on the two

The vector f contains the grid point values of Lg. The operator diag(·) gives a diagonal
matrix with the diagonal entries deﬁned by the argument vector. The maximum is taken
componentwise. The system (12) can be expressed more compactly as

Reduced Order Models

Let U ∈ RN ×n be basis for w. The reduced solution w = Uwr is governed by
UT AU + 1ε UT diag max −Uwrk+1 , 0

U wrk+1 = UT rk+1 .

(15)

The product UT diag max −Uwrk+1 , 0 U is the only product in (15) that cannot be precomputed oﬄine. Since the cost of evaluating this product scales with the size of the full-order
model, Eq. (15) does not oﬀer major computational savings.
Let Uλ ∈ RN ×nλ be basis for max −Uwrk+1 , 0 . The basis Uλ is assumed to be non
negative, that is, all components of Uλ are non negative. Thus, we assume
Uλ hr ≈ max −Uwrk+1 , 0 .

(16)

Performing a Galerkin projection yields
UTλ Uλ hr ≈ UTλ max −Uwrk+1 , 0 .

(17)

Unfortunately, Equation (17) still does not yield a computationally eﬃcient model because
UTλ max −Uwrk+1 , 0 = max −UTλ Uwrk+1 , 0 can not be precomputed oﬄine.
To achieve computational speed-up, a Petrov-Galerkin projection is performed using a binary selection matrix.
Consider a binary matrix P ∈ {0, 1}N ×m whose columns correspond to the ij column of
the identify matrix, P:,ij = I:,ij and where the index ij corresponds to the location of the
maximum component of the j th column of Uλ . Since Uλ > 0 and hr > 0, the full solution
max −Uwrk+1 , 0 is positive if and only if PT Uλ hr > 0. With the assumption outlined
in (16), it follows that
(18)
PT Uλ hr ≈ PT max −Uwrk+1 , 0 .
and ﬁnally
PT max −Uwrk+1 , 0 = max −PT Uwrk+1 , 0 .

(19)

Thus, the ﬁnal form of the ROM is as follows
Ar + 1ε CT diag max −Cwrk+1 , 0

C wrk+1 = rk+1
,
r

(20)

where Ar = UT AU, C = PT U, and rr = UT r. All components in Equation (20) scale with
the size of the reduced-order model.
The basis U ∈ RN ×n , and Uλ ∈ RN ×nλ are constructed by solving a low-rank approximation
problem for a set of solution snapshot. A solution snapshot, or simply a snapshot, is deﬁned
as a state vector wk computed as the solution of (12) for some instance of its parameters. A
solution matrix is deﬁned as a matrix whose columns are individual snapshots.
To construct U ∈ RN ×n , the following optimization problem is solved
minimize

U∈RN ×n , V∈Rn×K

X − UV

2
F,

(21)

where K is the number of solution snapshots. Hence, the basis U is comprised of the ﬁrst n
left singular vectors of the snapshot matrix X and V = ΣWT , where Σ is the diagonal matrix
of the ﬁrst n singular values of Σ, and W is the matrix of its ﬁrst n right singular vectors.
To construct Uλ ∈ RN ×nλ , the following constrained optimization problem is solved
minimize

Uλ ∈RN ×nλ , Vλ ∈Rnλ ×K

subject to

Xλ − U λ Vλ
Uλ ≥ 0
Vλ ≥ 0

2
F,

(22)

where Xλ ∈ RN ×K is the snapshot matrix comprised of the projected constraint violation
max −UT Uwk , 0 . Unlike problem (21), problem (22) does not have a closed form solution. Consequently, this problem is usually solved using an iterative method that typically
converges to a local minimum. Examples of such methods are the original multiplicative updating rule [18], the alternating non-negativity least-squares method [15], and block coordinate
descent algorithms [16].

Numerical Experiments

All numerical examples price an American put option with the strike price K = 100 and the expiry T = 0.5. Only at the money option is considered, that is, the value of u at s = K is sought.
Under the stochastic volatility models the value of u is computed at the variance v = θ. The full
order models are discretized using quadratically reﬁned spatial grids similar to ones employed
i
i
by the FD-NU method in [30]. The s-grid is deﬁned by si =
αNs − 1
αNs − 1 + 1 K,
i = 0, 2, . . . , Ns with α =
j
Nv

8.

For the stochastic volatility models the variance grid is deﬁned

vmax with vmax = 1. The uniform time steps are given by Δτ = N1τ T . In the
by vj =
experiments the number of spatial and temporal steps are chosen to be Ns = 128, Nv = 64,
and Nτ = 32. With this choice and the employed parameter ranges the absolute discretization
error is about 10−2 or less.
The snapshot matrix X is given by all vectors wk , k = 1, 2, . . . , Nτ , in all training runs. For
these training runs each model parameter is sampled at its extreme values and at the midpoint
between them. Thus, with two, ﬁve, and eight model parameters there are 32 = 9, 35 = 243,
and 38 = 6561 training runs, respectively. In the predictive ROM simulations, each parameter

runs, respectively. The sizes of the two reduced basis given by n and nλ are chosen to be the
same. The measured error is the absolute diﬀerence between the prices given by the reduced
order model and the full order model.

Computational Speed-up

For each problem considered, the speed-up factor delivered by its ROM for the online computations is reported in Table 1. All models are solved in MATLAB on a Intel Xeon 2.6GHz
CPU and all CPU times were measured using the tic-toc function on a single computational
thread via the -singleCompThread start-up option. A ROM is integrated in time using the
same scheme and time-step used to solve its corresponding FOM; see Section 2 for details. The
online speed-up is calculated by evaluating the ratio between the time-integration of the FOM
and the time-integration of the ROM.

Conclusions

Reduced order models (ROMs) were constructed for pricing American options under jumpdiﬀusion and stochastic volatility models. They are based on a penalty formulation of the linear
complementarity problem. The ﬁnite diﬀerence discretized diﬀerential operator and the penalty
term are projected using basis resulting from a proper orthogonal decomposition and a non

negative matrix factorization. In numerical experiments, from two to eight model parameters
are varied in a given range. For the one-dimensional Black–Scholes and Merton models about
16 ROM basis vectors were enough to reach 0.1% accuracy. For the two-dimensional Heston
and Bates models about 40 basis vectors were needed to reach the same accuracy. For these
two-dimensional models the computational speed-up was about 170 when the full order model
(FOM) and ROM have roughly the same 0.1% accuracy level. The solution of the FOM and
the ROM for two-dimensional models required about 7.5 and 0.044 seconds, respectively. With
the one-dimensional models the speed-up was negligible. Particularly the results with the Bates
model and eight parameters varying are impressive. A potential application for these ROMs is
fast and accurate calibration of the model parameters based on market data.
