Abstract. The flow of a viscous incompressible fluid in a plane channel is
simulated numerically with the use of a parallel computational code for the
numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes equations. The numerical method is
based on a mixed spectral-finite difference algorithm and the approach of the
Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) is followed in the calculations. A
turbulent-flow database is constructed, including 500 non-dimensional time
steps of the turbulent statistically steady state flow field at Reynolds number
Reτ = 180 . The coherent structures of turbulence are extracted from the
fluctuating portion of the velocity field with the use of the Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition technique (POD). Turbulent events occurring in the flow are
described in terms of temporal dynamics of the coherent turbulent structures,
the flow modes educed with the POD technique.

1 Introduction
The properties of turbulence in wall bounded flows have been investigated with the
use of a variety of techniques and methods. Accurate and extensive works in which a
considerable amount of results have been reviewed are due to Robinson [1] and
Panton [2]. Vortical structures of various kind have been observed in the inner region
of wall-bounded flows, following different mechanisms of self-sustainment (Panton
[2]). A fist type of mechanism involves the generation of a streamwise vortex from an
already existing streamwise vortex, near either end of the original vortex. A second
type of mechanism involves the generation of an horseshoe vortex from a parent
horseshoe vortex and the related interaction of the vortex legs, that includes the lift-up
of the vortex head. A third mechanism is the bridging between two streamwise fingers
of vorticity. Other phenomena occur in the outer region, like the regeneration of
hairpin vortices into packets with the vortical structures of the outer region interacting
with those of the inner region.
In spite of the large amount of scientific work accomplished, still there are no
definite conclusions on the character of the phenomena occurring in the near-wall

region of a wall-bounded turbulent flow. This is due to the complexity of turbulence
itself and to the quality of the scientific information that is possible to gather with the
use of the current research techniques.
Contemporary times are characterized by the fact that high-performance computers
are frequently used in turbulence research. In computational fluid dynamics a relevant
issue of is that of the method that has to be followed to take into account the
phenomenon of turbulence in the numerical simulations. The most rigorous approach
is that of the Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) according to which the objective of
calculating all turbulent scales is pursued and the Navier-Stokes equations are
numerically integrated without modifications. The crucial aspect of this method is the
accuracy of the calculations that in theory should to be sufficiently high as to resolve
the Kolmogorov microscales in space and time. DNS results for the case of the plane
channel have been reported, among others, by Kim et al. [3] and Moser et al. [4].
Modern techniques for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes equations in
conjunction with the increasing power of computers have the ability of greatly
increasing the amount of data gathered during a research of computational nature.
Moreover, the effort of studying turbulence in its full complexity has brought to the
condition of managing large amounts of data. A typical turbulent-flow database
includes all three components of the fluid velocity in all points of a three-dimensional
domain, gathered for an adequate number of time steps of the turbulent statistically
steady state. Such a database contains a considerable amount of information about the
physics of the flow and, in the formation of the instantaneous value of each variable,
all turbulent scales have contributed, being the effect of each scale nonlinearly
combined with all others. Methods can be applied in order to extract from a turbulentflow database only the relevant information, by separating the effects of
appropriately-defined modes of the flow from the background flow, i.e. extract the
coherent structures of turbulence.
In this work the issue of the coherent structures of turbulence in the wall region of
a turbulent channel flow is addressed. The coherent turbulent motions are educed with
the technique of the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) from a numerical
database that has been built with the use of a parallel, three-dimensional, timedependent computational code for the numerical integration of the Navier-Stokes
equations. The DNS approach has been followed in the calculations.

2 Numerical Techniques
The numerical simulations have been performed with a parallel computational code
based on a mixed spectral-finite difference algorithm. The system of the unsteady
Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids in three dimensions and nondimensional conservative form is considered (i & j = 1,2,3):

where ui (u, v, w ) are the velocity components in the cartesian coordinate system
xi (x, y, z ) . Equations (1) are nondimensionalized by the channel half-width δ for
lenghts, wall shear velocity uτ = τ w ρ for velocities, ρuτ2 for pressure and δ uτ for

time, being Reτ = (uτ δ ν ) the friction Reynolds number. The fields are admitted to be
periodic in the streamwise (x) and spanwise (z) directions, and equations (1) are
Fourier transformed accordingly. The nonlinear terms in the momentum equation are
evaluated pseudospectrally by anti-transforming the velocities back in physical space
to perform the products (FFTs are used). A dealiasing procedure is applied to avoid
errors in transforming the results back to Fourier space. In order to have a better
spatial resolution near the walls, a grid-stretching law of hyperbolic-tangent type has
been introduced for the grid points along y, the direction orthogonal to the walls. For
the time advancement, a third-order Runge-Kutta algorithm has been implemented
and the time marching procedure is accomplished with the fractional-step method
(Kim et al. [3]). No-slip boundary conditions at the walls and cyclic conditions in the
streamwise and spanwise directions have been applied to the velocity. More detailed
descriptions of the numerical scheme, of its reliability and of the performance
obtained on the parallel computers that have been used, can be found in Alfonsi et al.
[5] and Passoni et al. [6],[7],[8].

3 Turbulent-Flow Database
By recalling the wall formalism, one has: xi+ = xi uτ ν = xi δ τ , t + = tuτ2 ν = tuτ δ τ ,

δ + = δ δ τ , u + = u uτ , Reτ = uτ δ ν = δ δ τ = δ + , where u is streamwise velocity
averaged on a x-z plane and time, δ τ = ν uτ is the viscous length and δ uτ the
viscous time unit. In Table 1 the characteristic parameters of the numerical
simulations are reported.

It can be verified that in the present work there are 8 grid points in the y direction,
within the viscous sublayer ( y + ≤ 7 ). The Kolmogorov spatial microscale, estimated
using the criterion of the average dissipation rate per unit mass across the width of the
channel, results η + ≈ 1.8 . After the insertion of appropriate initial conditions, the
initial transient of the flow in the channel has been first simulated, the turbulent

4 Proper Orthogonal Decomposition
The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is a technique that can be applied for the
extraction of the coherent structures from a turbulent flow field (Berkooz et al. [10],
Sirovich [11]). By considering an ensemble of temporal realizations of a velocity field
ui x j , t on a finite domain D, one wants to find which is the most similar function to
the elements of the ensemble, on average. This problem corresponds to find a
deterministic vector function ϕ i (x j ) such that (i & j=1,2,3):

( )

.

(6)

A necessary condition for problem (6) is that ϕ i (x j ) is an eigenfunction, solution of
the eigenvalue problem and Fredholm integral equation of the first kind:

∫

D

Rij (xl , xl′ )ϕ j (xl′ )dxl′ =

∫

D

ui (xk , t )u j (xk′ , t ) ϕ j (xk′ )dxk′ = λϕ i (xk )

(7)

where Rij = ui (xk , t )u j (xk′ , t ) is the two-point velocity correlation tensor. To each

eigenfunction ϕ i (x j ) is associated a real positive eingenvalue λ(n ) and every
member of the ensemble can be reconstructed by means of a modal decomposition in
the eigenfunctions themselves:
(n )

( ) ∑n an (t )ϕi (n ) (x j )

ui x j , t =

(8)

that can be seen as a decomposition of the originary random field into deterministic
structures with random coefficients.
In the present work the POD technique is applied for the analysis of the fluctuating
portion of the velocity field in a plane channel at Reτ = 180 . Besides the timeaveraged quantities outlined above, the decomposition properties are used to compute
two time-dependent quantities (Webber et al. [12]), the kinetic energy of the
fluctuations E (t ) and the representational entropy S (t ) , respectively:
E (t ) =

to be used to follow the temporal dynamics of the coherent structures of the flow. A
small value of S (t ) indicates that the corresponding energy is contained in few
modes, while a large value of S (t ) indicates that the energy is distributed over many
modes. A more detailed description of the POD algorithm that has been developed
and previous results can be found in Alfonsi & Primavera [13] and Alfonsi et al. [14].

5 Results
1,820,448 eigenfunctions (3 × N x × N y × N z ) and correspondent eigenvalues are
determined as a result of the decomposition. Figure 1 shows the fluctuating energy
content E (t ) (9) of the first 5,188 eigenfunctions of the decomposition with time
(0 ≤ t + ≤ 1800) , that alone incorporate 95% of the total energy content. The plot of
E (t ) shows a sharp peak at t + = 414 , besides some other smaller spikes. The peak of

628

G. Alfonsi and L. Primavera

E (t ) reflects a sharp rise and subsequent fall of the turbulent activity in the interval

129.6 ≤ t + ≤ 615.6 and reveals the occurrence of a turbulent event. The correspondent
plot of S (t ) (not shown here) shows a sharp fall and rise during the event in a time
frame practically concident with that of E (t ) . The minimum value of S (t ) occurs at
t + = 284.4 indicating that during the growing-energy/falling entropy part of the event,
the energy arrives to be distributed over a rather low number of flow modes. After
t + = 284.4 the entropy starts growing while the energy is still rising until t + = 414 ,
the instant corresponding to the peak of the energy within the event cycle, actually
followed by another smaller peak at t + = 489.6 . This indicates that for a short time
interval ∆t + = 75.6 the energy remains high and then rapidly decreases in the interval
489.6 ≤ t + ≤ 615.6 , redistributing over many modes (the entropy is still rising). The
event cycle actually ends at t + = 615.6 . The turbulent event in the whole lasts for
∆t + = 486 ( 129.6 ≤ t + ≤ 615.6 ), 2.7 of 10 δ uτ time units computed.

6 Concluding Remarks
The analysis of the flow field of a numerically simulated turbulent channel flow is
performed in terms of flow modes determined with the POD technique. A peak of the
kinetic energy of the velocity fluctuations reflects a sharp rise and subsequent fall of
the turbulent activity in the interval 129.6 ≤ t + ≤ 615.6 and reveals the occurrence of
a turbulent event.
