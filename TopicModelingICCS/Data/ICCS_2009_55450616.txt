Abstract. Nowadays, how to effectively predict financial distress has become
an important issue for companies, investors and many other user groups. The
purpose of this paper is to apply the Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming
(MCQP) model to predict financial distress of the listed manufacturing
companies. Firstly, we introduce the formulation of MCQP model. Then we use
ten-folder cross validation to test the stability and accuracy of MCQP model on
a real-life listed companies’ financial ratios dataset. At last, we compare MCQP
model with other two well-known models: Logistic Regression and SVM
models. The experimental results show that MCQP is accurate and stable for
predicting the financial distress of the listed manufacturing companies.
Consequently, we can safely say that MCQP is capable of providing stable and
credible results in predicting financial distress.
Keywords: Financial distress prediction, MCQP, Logistic, SVM.

1 Introduction
With the rapid development of capital market in recent years, making accurate
financial distress prediction has become more and more important to many user
groups, such as bank loan officers, investors, creditors, regulators and auditors [1].
The last few decades have witnessed a large body of research work on predicting
finance distress from financial statement. As early as 1966, Beaver [2] discussed that
the default prediction problem could be regarded as a problem of evaluating the
probability of financial distress conditional upon the value of a specific financial ratio.
In 1968, Altman [3] developed a Z-score bankruptcy prediction model based on five
financial ratios using Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA). In 1980, Ohlson [4]
applied the logistic regression model in bankruptcy prediction research. Unlike MDA,
the logistic regression model does not based on normal distribution or the equality of
covariance matrices of the two groups. He was followed by several other authors:

Mensah [5], Casey and Bartczak [6] and Gentry at al [7]. From the late 1980s, the
Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) techniques were introduced to
financial distress prediction studies [8, 9]. Most recently, Yu-Chiang Hu and Jake
Ansell [10] applied the SVM model which based on convex quadratic programming
to predict financial distress.
In recent years, researchers from Multiple Criteria Mathematical Programming
(MCMP) are stepping into data mining field and propose many promising
classification models. For instance, in 2001, Y. Shi [11] built up the Multiple Criteria
Linear Programming (MCLP) and Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP)
models which have received many attentions as their successful applications in
finance, biology, medical insurance and many other social fields. The purpose of this
paper is to apply the MCQP model to predict the financial distress of the listed
manufacturing companies in China.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce the
MCQP model; in Section 3, we introduce the financial ratios dataset of the listed
manufacturing companies; in Section 4, we test MCQP on this dataset using 10-folder
cross-validation and compare its performance with two well-known models: Logistic
Regression and SVM; in Section 5, we conclude our paper with some discussions.

2 Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP) Model
In this section, we will give a short introduction of MCQP model. Assume a twogroup classification problem {G1, G 2} . Given a training sample Tr = {G1, G 2} , where
n is the total number of records in the training sample. Each training instance
Ai (i = 1, ...n ) has r attributes. A boundary scalar b is used to separate G1 and G2 .
r

Thus a vector X = ( x1, x 2... xn ) ∈ R can be identified to establish the following linear
inequality [12]:
AiX < b , some Ai ∈ G1
AiX ≥ b , some Ai ∈ G 2

(1)

To formulate the criteria and complete constraints for data separation, some
variables will be introduced. α i is defined to measure the overlapping of two-group
boundary for record Ai , that means if Ai ∈ G1 but we misclassified it into G 2 or vice
versa, there is a distance α i and the value equals AiX − b . Then β i is defined to
*

measure the distance of record Ai from its adjusted boundary b , that means if Ai is
correctly classified, there is a distance β i and the value equals AiX − b , where
*

b = b + α i or b = b − α i . Suppose f (α ) denotes for the relationship of all
overlapping α i while g ( β ) denotes for the aggregation of all distances β i . The final
*

*

absolute catch rates depend on simultaneously minimizing f (α ) and maximizing
g ( β ) . By using the l p norm to represent f (α ) and lq norm to represent g ( β )

respectively, we get a generalized bi-criteria programming framework as follows:

AiX − α i + β i − b = 0, Ai ∈ G1

(2)

AiX +α i − β i − b = 0, Ai ∈ G 2

α i , β i ≥ 0, i = 1,..., n
Where Ai is given, X and b are unrestricted.

Fig. 1. Two-group classification model

All variables and their relationships are represented in Figure 1. There are two
groups in Figure 1: black dot indicates G1 data objects and star indicates G2 data
objects. There is one misclassified data object from each group if the boundary scalar
b is used to classify these two groups, whereas adjusted boundaries b − α i and
b + α i separate two groups without misclassification.
As far as Model 1 is considered, when setting p = q = 2 and combing the two
objective functions into a single objective function by using wα ≥ 0 and wβ ≥ 0 , we
can get the MCQP model as follows:

(3)

Ai x + α i − β i − b = 0, ∀Ai ∈ G2

α i , β i ≥ 0, i = 1,..., n
Model 2 is a non-convex problem, thus it is also a NP-hard problem. It is very
difficult to get the global minimizer, especially for large problem. In order to solve (3)
efficiently, we propose an algorithm, which converges to a local minimizer of (2).

3 Financial Ratios Dataset
The sample is selected from the manufacturing companies listed in the Shanghai
Stock Exchange (SSE) and the Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE). Financial states of
these companies are categorized into two classes: healthy and distressed. Companies
which are Specially Treated (ST) by China Securities Supervision and Management
Committee (CSSMC) will be taken as the distressed ones, while those which are
never specially treated by CSSMC will be seen as the healthy ones. 775
manufacturing companies are selected, of which 46 are ST companies and the
remained 729 are healthy ones. For healthy companies, their financial statements in

620

Y. Wang et al.

the last year will be used, while for ST companies, their financial statements in the
year before the special treated year1 will be used.
In this paper, we use the financial statements between 2003 and 2007, then 40 ST
companies are selected out of the total 46 ST companies. Due to the scarcity of
ST companies, a matched-pair design is used to compose the examples. Each ST
company is matched with two healthy companies randomly selected from the 729
healthy companies. By doing so, the sample is composed of 120 listed manufacturing
companies, including 40 ST records and 80 healthy records.
According to the standards of summarization, measurability, and sensitivity, 24
financial rations which derived from the financial statements are calculated for the

The Year before the Special Treated Year (YSTY) is defined as follows: suppose the time
when a company is specially treated as the benchmark year t0. If the company is specially
treated among January to April, the YSTY is defined as two years before t0. If the company is
specially treated among May to December, YSTY is defined as the last year before t0.

ratios, profitability ratios, growth ratios, structure ratios and cash flow ratios which
are listed in Table 1.

4 Experiments
4.1 Empirical Study

Cross-validation is frequently used for estimating generalization error, model
selection, experimental design evaluation, training exemplars selection, or pruning
outliers. By definition, cross-validation is the practice of partitioning a sample of data
into sub samples so that analysis is initially performed on a single sub sample, while
further sub samples are retained "blind" in order for subsequent use in confirming and
validating the initial analysis[14]. The basic idea is to set aside some of the data
randomly for training a model, then the data remained will be used to test the
performance of the model. In this paper, a ten-folder cross-validation is used to test
MCQP’s performance as shown in Algorithm 2. The data gathered is divided into two
groups. The training group is composed of 20 ST records and 20 healthy records and
the testing group is composed of 20 ST records and 60 healthy records. The process to
select training and testing sets is described as follows: first, 20 ST records and 20
healthy records are randomly selected from the dataset. Then, they are combined to
form a single training dataset, with the remained 20 ST records and 60 healthy records
merged into a testing set.

Step2. Sort all of the 24 attributes of X , the larger X , the more important of this attribute.

Step3. Calculate the score of each record Ai and get score array Score[i] = AiX ,
for ∀Ai ∈ A .
Step4. Compare Score[i] with boundary b , if Ai ∈ G1 with Score[i]< b , or Ai ∈ G 2 with
Score[i]≥ b , then increase the number of correctly classified records Ntr in training set
and Nts in testing set.
Step5. Calculate the classification performance both on training set ( Ntr / TR ) and testing
set ( Nts / TS ) and return the training accuracy Rtr and testing accuracy Rts .
End.

4.2 Experiment Results

Table 2 shows the ten-folder cross-validation result on the financial ratios dataset. The
columns "ST" and "H" refer to the number of records that are correctly classified as

622

Y. Wang et al.

"ST" and "Healthy", respectively. The column "Accuracy" is calculated using
correctly classified records divided by the total records in that class.
From Table 2, we can see that the average accuracies of 10 groups training sets is
98.00% on the ST companies and 100% on the healthy companies, while the average
accuracies of 10 groups testing sets is 90.00% on the ST companies and 96.50% on
the healthy companies. The results indicate that a good separation of the ST class and
Healthy class is observed with MCQP model.

4.3 Comparison of MCQP with Logistic Regression and SVM

Table 3 exhibits the comparison results of MCQP, Logistic Regression and SVM. The
first column lists the three algorithms. The second column is the recall rate of ST
companies (more attention are paid to capture ST companies). And the third column
is the accuracy of correctly classified companies (including both ST and healthy
companies). It was found that the logistic regression model is slightly better than
MCQP model on accuracy. However, MCQP model performs a little better on recall
rate. Actually, recall rate is more important than accuracy as the misclassification of a
real ST company will lead to a heavy loss. SVM achieves the least recall rate and
accuracy. The reason may be that when doing classification, SVM chooses some
marginal points as the delegates in each class, and it also thinks maximizing the
distance of the delegates is maximizing the distance of each class. However, since our
financial ratios dataset of the listed manufacturing companies probably obeys the
Gaussian distribution, which means the points around the center is of the most
important, choosing the marginal points as the delegates is not persuasive.

5 Conclusion
How to effectively predict financial distress becomes an urgent need for bank loan
officers, investors, creditors, regulators and auditors. As a promising data mining
approach, Multiple Criteria Quadratic Programming (MCQP) method has been
extensively applied in many business activities. In this paper, we introduced MCQP
into predicting financial distress of China’ listed manufacturing companies. At the
beginning, we collected and built a real-life listed manufacturing companies’ dataset,
which has 120 records with 24 attributes. Then we tested MCQP on this dataset using
ten-folder cross-validation. Finally, we compared MCQP with Logistic Regression
and SVM. The experimental results show that MCQP is accurate and stable for
predicting the financial distress, and moreover, MCQP is superior to Logistic
Regression and SVM models in the sense of accuracy and average recall rate.
Consequently, we can say that MCQP model is capable of predicting the financial
distress of the listed manufacturing companies accurately and stably.
