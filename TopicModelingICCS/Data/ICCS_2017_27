Taylor expansions in which automatic differentiation toolboxes and complex finite differences
can be used in order to approximate derivatives [7]. One drawback of TR methods based on
surrogate models of this form is the myopia suffered by low-order Taylor expansions. This can
imply, in some cases, a large number of iterations for TR based methods in order to obtain
accurate solutions to optimal values. We think this problem can be alleviated making use of
samples (data points) from the search space and then, convex combinations of linear Taylor
expansions about each sampled point can be used in order to build a surrogate model of the
cost function. This simple strategy can improve the visibility of surrogate models regarding
their cost functions and therefore, accurate optimal values can be approximated within a few
number of iterations.
This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 a theoretical background about TR based
methods and derivative-free optimization is given, section 3 discusses the proposed surrogate
model and their (potential) use in the context of TR derivative-free optimization, in section 4,
the proposed methods are tested making use of the three dimensional variational optimization
problem from data assimilation, the results are analysed in terms of accuracy and cost function
values, finally, the conclusions are stated in section 5.

Preliminaries

We consider optimization problems of the form,
x∗ = arg min f (x) , for x ∈ Rn×1 ,

(1)

x

where f (x) is a continuous, real-valued function and n is the number of variables. To be concise,
we focus on Trust Region (TR) methods [1, 2] which make use of low-order Taylor expansions
as their surrogate models [8] of f (x),
f (x) ≈ m(x)

where x0 ∈ Rn×1 is the expansion point. The solution of (1) can be approximated via the
solution x+ ∈ Rn×1 within a trust region of radius ∆ > 0 ∈ R,
x+ = arg min f (x) , for x ∈ B(x0 , ∆) ,

(2b)

where B(x0 , ∆) denotes the trust region (ball) of radius ∆ centred at x0 . The simplest approximation of x+ in which one can think reads,
x+ = x0 + s with s = −

The quality of the local approximation m(x) can be measured via the ratio,
ρ=

f (x0 ) − f (x+ )
,
m(x0 ) − m(x+ )

(2d)

where values of ρ near to zero make evident that m(x) is a poor approximation of f (x). Conversely, accurate local models m(x) provide ρ values near to one. Depending on the value of

ρ, the trust region size ∆ and the expansion point (solution) x0 can be updated. Since highly
non-linear functions can take place in (1), models based on (2a) will require small trust region
sizes in order to obtain accurate surrogates models of f (x) during the optimization process.
Consequently, a large number of iterations is may needed in order to obtain a descent approximation of the optimal value x∗ in (1). This obeys to the myopia suffered by low-order Taylor
expansions. Besides, the use of high-order Taylor polynomials is prohibitive because, in practice, their computations are simply intractable and/or in others, the derivative information of
f (x) is not available. For instance, in the context of data assimilation, the number of variables
during the computation of the posterior mode of the underlying error distribution ranges in the
order of millions and therefore, gradient approximations are usually performed making use of
parallel computing methods not to mention, the intractability of computing (or approximating)
Hessians in such contexts. We think, this issue can be resolved by sampling points from the
search space and then computing surrogate models as convex combinations of local linear Taylor expansions about the sampled points. This strategy allow us to obtain more information of
f (x) about a point x0 . The next section discusses some practical TR implementations based
on convex combinations of low-order Taylor expansions.

Proposed Implementations

In this section, we proposed a practical TR implementation based on convex combinations of
linear Taylor polynomials.

3.1

Proposed surrogate model

Given a current solution (initially, a guess) xc ∈ Rn×1 of the optimization problem (1), we build
a set of data points about it,
X = [x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ] ∈ Rn×k ,

(3a)

by taking samples of the form,
xi = xc +

∆
· γ ∈ Rn×1 , for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1,
2 · γ i  i

(3b)

where k is the sample size, γ i ∈ Rn×1 , for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, is a random direction sampled from
a multivariate standard Normal distribution, • denotes the L-2 norm, xk = xc , and ∆ > 0.
Note that, the distance between the i-th sample, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, and the current solution
is ∆/2. We make use of unitary directions γi / γi  in order to avoid the overlapping of the
sampled points (3b) with the current solution xc and even more, to retain the sampled points
inside the trust region B(xc , ∆) otherwise, we should validate whether the sampled points fall
inside the trust region or not. The sample (3a) can be used in order to build local linear models
of f (x),
Li (x) = f (xi ) + ∇f (xi )T · (x − xi ) ,

(4)

which can be used in order to build the local linear model,

Interestingly, the weights (6) work as switches in which, the closest Taylor expansion to a

where ρx , ∆inc , ∆dec , ∆max , ρ1∆ , and ρ2∆ are user-defined parameters. Then, a new set X in
(3a) is built and the process is repeated until some stopping criteria is satisfied. The hope with
model (5) is that, since more points are sampled from the search space, we have a better local
approximation of the function (1) and therefore, larger trust region sizes can be utilized during
the local optimization processes. This can significantly improve the performance of the Trust
Region method in terms of number of iterations. In practice, high-order derivatives do not
come for free, can be very difficult to compute or simply, they are not available and therefore,
a descent approximation of f (x) can be obtained through the proposed model (5).

Experimental Results

In this section, we test our proposed TR implementation making use of the three-dimensional
optimization problem from data assimilation. The tests are designed in order to measure the
robustness of the proposed implementation for optimization problems with a large number of
variables and just a few samples from the search space (small k)

4.1

A Data Assimilation optimization problem

The goal of sequential data assimilation is to estimate the unknown state of a system xtrue ∈
Rn×1 which approximately evolves according to a (non-linear) model operator [9],
xtk+1 = Mtk →tk+1 (xtk ) ,
based on a prior estimate,
xb = xtrue + θ b ∈ Rn×1 ,
and a noisy observation,


y = H xtrue + θ o ∈ Rp×1 ,

where n is the number of model components, p is the number of observed components, the
background error θ b ∈ Rn×1 is characterized by a Normal distrbution with moments,
θ b ∼ N (0, B) ,
while observational errors θ o follow the distribution,
θ o ∼ N (0, R) ,

with B ∈ Rn×n denoting the background error covariance matrix, R ∈ Rp×p is the estimated
data error covariance matrix, H : Rn×1 → Rp×1 is the (non-linear) observational operator
which projects model state variables to the observation space. The assimilation of observations
is performed in order to adjust the model state xb to information of xtrue encapsulated in y, for
instance, information captured by sensors. The assimilation can be performed by considering
the three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) cost function [10],
J (x) =

which can be seen as the negative log of a posterior error distribution when data and background errors are assumed Gaussian. Thus, the posterior state can be computed by solving the
optimization problem,
xa = arg min J (x) ,

(11)

x

xa ∈ Rn×1 is better known as the analysis state. In practice, several issues are presented when
one wants to solve the optimization problem (11), two of the most common problems are,
• The number of variables in the context of geophysical systems range in the order of millions
and in the absence of information about the structure of B−1 and R−1 , the computation
of Hessians is intractable which limits the use of some traditional numerical optimization
algorithms [11].
• The observation operator H(x) can be strongly nonlinear which implies the solution of
a highly non-linear optimization problem in (11). In the context of TR algorithms, the
myopia of surrogate models will demand a large number of iterations in order to obtain
accurate solutions.
The experimental settings are described below,
• Since the computational effort of a single cost function evaluation of (10) can be high, in
operational data assimilation, we restrict the number of sampled points k to 5.
• We make use of an atmospheric general circulation model better-known as the SPEEDY
model [12] in order to simulate the general circulation on the Earth of wind-components.
The u direction of the wind is analysed in the spectral space. For the assimilation,
the snapshot is taken after one year of model propagation starting with a system in
equilibrium.
• We use a single layer of the zonal wind component u. The number of zonal and meridional components are 192 and 96, respectively, for a total of n = 18432 variables to be
approximated. Notice, the problem size is several times the number of sampled points
from the search space (k = 5)
• Background and observational errors are assumed uncorrelated with diagonal entries 0.05
and 0.01, respectively.
• Three observational errors are assumed during the experiments: linear H(x)i = xi ,
quadratic H(x)i = x2i , and cubic H(x)i = x3i , where i stands for index component.
• The linear surrogate model (4) is used in order to approximate J (x) inside the trust
region.

• Several initial trust region sizes are considered during the experiments, 5 ≤ ∆0 ≤ 50.
• We perform a single assimilation step in the context of the 3D-Var optimization problem.
• The gradient of (10) is approximated by linearizing the observational operator about x,


∇ J (x) ≈ B−1 · x − xb − GT · R−1 · [H(x) − y]

where H ≈ G from which the surrogate gradients are obtained. Note that, the use of G
introduces errors in the approximation of ∇ J (x) as usually happens in practice.

• The system is fully observed p = n.
• Since a large number of function evaluations is prohibitive for (10), the number of iterations is set to 20 for all configurations.
• The initial solution is the background state xb .
The results of the experiments are shown in figure 2. Note that, as can be seen in figures
2a and 2c for quadratic and linear observational operators the larger the initial trust region
size, the faster the convergence to optimal values. Even more, by contrasting these plots with
the error plots shown in figures 2b and 2d, for certain configurations, the number of iterations
can be decreased in order to avoid the evident overfitting of the observation y which is typical
in the context of 3D-Var optimization problems for large number of iterations [13]. In the
cubic case, at the beginning of iterations, the larger the initial trust region size, the faster the
convergence, however, this patron is not held among iterations as can be seen in figure 2e. In
addition, no overfitting is presented in the context of cubic observational operators as can be
seen in figure 2f. Results for the quadratic observation operator are shown in figure 3. As can
be seen in figure 3b, the impact of such operator on the observation y allows us to understand
how the information is mapped to the observational space wherein the information provided by
numerical models xb and measurements y are contrasted. Note that, the states recovered by
our approximations are similar to the reference state xtrue of the system. Besides, the number
of iterations is enough to remove the spurious u-wind waves in xb and to estimate the high
wind-components presented near the poles. From all experimental results, it is clear that the
proposed TR implementation is able to handle large optimization problems with just a few
samples from the search space. This makes the proposed TR implementation capable for being
used in the context of geophysics and data assimilation wherein the number of variables ranges
in the order of millions.

Conclusions

This paper discusses the use of surrogate models based on convex combinations of linear Taylor
polynomials for Trust Region based methods. In general, the proposed method work as follows:
samples from the cost function are taken, linear Taylor expansions are performed about each
sampled point and then, a surrogate model is built based on convex combinations of such Taylor

expansions, the Trust Region framework is then utilized in order to validate the quality of the
proposed model. Even more, the surrogate model is proved to be fully linear which guaranties
the convergence of Trust Region methods in the context of derivative-free optimization. Experimental tests are performed making use of the three-dimensional optimization problem from
data assimilation. The results reveal that, the use of the proposed surrogate model mitigate
the myopia suffered by Trust Region methods based on single low-order Taylor polynomials and
even more, their use decreases the number of iterations needed in order to approximate optimal
solutions.
