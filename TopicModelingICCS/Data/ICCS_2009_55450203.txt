Abstract. The interactions between carbon monoxide and small clusters of silver atoms are examined. Optimal geometries of the clustermolecules complexes, i.e. silver cluster - carbon monoxide molecule, are
obtained for diﬀerent sizes of silver clusters and diﬀerent numbers of carbon monoxide molecules. This analysis is performed in terms of diﬀerent
binding energy of these complexes and analysis of the frontier orbitals of
the complex compared to those of its constituents. The silver atom and
the dimer (Ag2 ) bond up to three carbon monoxide molecules per Ag
atom, while the larger clusters appear to saturate at two CO’s per Ag
atom. Analysis of the binding energy of each CO molecule to the cluster reveals that the general trend is a decrease with the number of CO
molecules, with the exception of Ag where the second CO molecule is the
strongest bound. A careful analysis of the frontier orbitals shows that the
bent structures of AgCO and Ag2 CO are a result from the interaction
of the highest occupied orbital of Ag (5s) and Ag2 (σ) with the lowest
unoccupied orbital of CO (π ∗ ). The same bent structure also appears in
the bonding of CO to some of the atoms in the larger clusters. Another
general trend is that the CO molecules have a tendency to bond atop of
an atom rather than on bridge or face sites. These results can help us
elucidate the catalytic properties of small silver clusters at the atomic
level.

Introduction

Studies directed at understanding the interaction of metal clusters with
molecules remain the subject of active theoretical and experimental studies [1].
The recent shift in the focus of enquiry from the study of the structural and
electronic properties of single-component metal clusters to the study of the interaction of metal clusters with molecules is driven in large part by the potential
use of metal clusters in heterogeneous catalysis. Clusters have been long known
to show size-speciﬁc physical and chemical properties that are often at odds
with their bulk properties. This size-speciﬁc behavior is evident in the catalytic

properties as well, leading to highly reactive clusters whose catalytic behavior is
at odds with their bulk counterparts. For example, it has been known for some
years now that gold nanoclusters supported on metal oxides such as TiO2 can
eﬃciently oxidize carbon dioxide at fairly low temperatures [2]. More recently,
the eight atom gold cluster supported on an MgO substrate has been shown to be
the smallest clusters capable of catalyzing the oxidation of carbon monoxide [3].
The situation for silver clusters is less conclusive. In the bulk and the near bulk
regime of several micrometers, silver plays a unique role that is not replicated
by any other transition metal in the selective oxidation of ethylene into ethylene
oxide, a widely-used industrial catalytic process [4]. Yet, little is known about the
details of the mechanism of the oxidation reaction at an atomistic level. There
is signiﬁcant progress of late in experimental techniques that can be used to
soft-land clusters on to substrates to perform precise size speciﬁc investigations
to study the size-speciﬁc chemical reactivity of clusters and consequently their
catalytic properties. Likewise, advances in ﬁrst-principles theoretical methods
such as density functional theory and quantum chemistry techniques provide
another direct route to studying the chemical properties of the clusters at an
atomistic level. Since it is as yet unclear as to whether silver clusters exhibit
the catalytic oxidation of CO like gold clusters do, it is perhaps not surprising
that several theoretical [5,6,7,8,9] and experimental [9,10] investigations have
attempted to address the interaction of silver clusters with O2 and CO in an
attempt to study the fundamental cluster-molecule interaction as the ﬁrst step
towards understanding the larger question of the role, if any, of silver clusters in
the catalytic oxidation of CO.
In this paper, we examine the interaction of small silver clusters (Agn , 1 ≤
n ≤ 4) with one or more CO molecules. The ground (2S) state of the Ag atom
is well-separated ﬁrst excited (2D) state, the d orbitals are localized relative to
the 5s orbitals and bonding in the silver clusters is dominated by the 5s electrons. It is not surprising therefore that silver clusters display structural and
electronic properties that are quite similar to those of alkali metal clusters. The
geometric and electronic properties of pure silver clusters have been well studied
[11,12,13,14] and the candidates for the lowest energy structures in the size range
of n ≤ 10 that is of interest to us are well-elucidated. We study the interaction
of the cluster molecules system under the framework of the generalized gradient
approximation of the density functional theory. The functionals used in the calculations presented in this paper combine Becke exchange functional [15] with
the Perdew-Wang [16] correlation functional as implemented inGaussian 03 [17].
A 28-electron core ([Ar]3d10) eﬀective core potential is combined with contracted Gaussian-type orbitals for the remaining 19 electrons for the Ag atoms
[18]. Carbon and oxygen atoms are represented by the DGTZVP[19] all-electron
basis sets as implemented in Gaussian 03 [17]. The selection of pseudopotential and exchange-correlation functionals was made to compare with previous
results on the bare clusters as reported in ref. [14] and the choice in that reference was based in tests to reproduce the properties of Ag, Ag2 and Ag3 . The
DGTZVP was chosen to reproduce the experimental binding energy of CO. The

equilibrium structures were obtained using gradient-based methods. The optimizations were performed in all degrees of freedom. Normal mode analysis was
performed to determine whether a structure was a minimum or a saddle point
in the potential energy surface of the cluster. The starting point was the bare
silver cluster structures of ref. [14]. CO molecules were added until saturation
was reached. The saturation was 3 CO molecules per Ag atom for the Ag and
Ag2 . Ag3 and Ag4 bonded 2 CO molecules per silver atom. The bonding of CO
to the cluster is analyzed in terms of the binding energy of CO to the clusters.

Results
Bare Silver Clusters

In this subsection we brieﬂy review the properties of small silver clusters as
obtained in the previous study of Srinivas et al. [14]. In Fig. 1 we present the
lowest energy isomers of Agn , n =1 -4, and their respective binding energies as
obtained in ref. [14] and conﬁrmed by our current results. Ag4 is a rhombus
rather than a tetrahedron which is a common form for tetramers of other elements. A 3-dimensional form will only form for neutral silver clusters containing
7 or more atoms[14]. The binding energy in the range of n≤ 10 increases, nonmonotonically, with the number of atoms in the cluster. In this work we will
restrict ourselves to the smaller size clusters (n≤4) as we are more interested
in understanding the binding mechanism of carbon monoxide to the bare and
CO-rich silver clusters.

AgN (CO)x

To understand the mechanism and the energetics of the bonding of CO to small
silver clusters we begin with the structures presented in Fig. 1 and add CO
molecules until they no longer bond to the clusters. This determination is made
when the binding energy of the last CO to the previous cluster is negative or zero.
In Fig. 2 we present the structure of Ag(CO)x , x = 1−3. One can see that in both
AgCO and Ag(CO)2 the CO molecule is bent with respect to the Ag-C bond. A
careful analysis of the frontier orbitals of both the Ag atom and dimer and of CO
shows that the π ∗ orbital of CO tends to align with the 5s orbital of Ag or the σ
orbital of Ag2 , resulting in the bent structure of Fig. 2. In the following analysis
we will consider the binding energy of the CO to the complex Ag(CO)n−1 as

BE(last CO) = E(CO)+E(Ag(CO)n−1 )-E(Ag(CO)n ). Using this energy we can
determine the relative stability of the complex as CO molecules are added. The
binding energy of CO to Ag is relatively weak, for the ﬁrst CO it is about 0.276
eV, it increases for the second CO to 0.619 eV, and then decreases again to
0.446 eV when a third carbon monoxide is added. This explains why the binding
energy per CO deﬁned as BE(CO) = [n×E(CO)+E(Ag(CO))-E(Ag(CO)n )]/n
reported in Fig. 2 for Ag(CO)2 and Ag(CO)3 are nearly the same. A fourth
CO did not bond to the cluster. Ag(CO)3 is very symmetric, belonging to the
D3 h point symmetry group. This suggests, that although the third CO is weakly
bonded, each Ag atom can bond up to 3 CO’s.
In Fig. 3 we display the Ag2 (CO)x , x = 1 − 6, indicating again that although
a weakly bonded system, each Ag atom can bond up to 3 carbon monoxide
molecules. Just as discussed in the previous paragraph, in all the cases studied
for Ag2 the O atom is not in the same line as the Ag-C bond. A careful analysis
of the frontier orbitals once again show us that this is a result of the interaction
of the π ∗ orbital of CO with the orbitals of Ag. The cluster becomes less stable

upon addition of CO. However, the smallest binding energy of CO to Ag2 is still
comparable with the binding of a single CO to the Ag atom.
The structures of the Ag3 (CO)x , x = 1 − 6 are displayed in Fig. 4. The
ﬁrst thing to note is that in Ag3 (CO) and Ag3 (CO)3 the top CO is in perfect
alignment with the Ag-C bond. In this case the orbitals that interact are the π ∗
of CO with a π-like orbital of Ag3 . However, this trend is not followed for all
single CO bonded to Ag, as one can see in the case of Ag3 (CO)2 . Ag3 bonds
up to 2 CO’s per Ag atom, something that can be explained by the extra AgAg bond. A possibility of binding 3 CO’s per Ag atoms would be as a linear
Ag3 backbone and each Ag(CO)3 stacked in a staggered fashion, as a sandwich
cluster. This structure demonstrated to be unstable and we don’t think larger
sizes will be stable. The binding energy per CO molecule shows a decreasing
trend, but like in the case of Ag2 , the strength of the weakest CO-Ag bond in
Ag3 (CO)6 is comparable to the Ag-CO bond in AgCO. In Ag3 (CO)5 the 2 CO’s
bonded to a single Ag atom are perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. While
in Ag3 (CO)6 the last two CO’s are in the same plane as Ag3 . One can reason
that these are steric eﬀects that will tend to minimize the repulsion between the
CO molecules.
The last set of structures studied in this work is displayed in Fig. 5. Both
Ag4 CO and Ag4 (CO)2 have the CO molecule aligned with the Ag-CO bond.
The explanation is very similar to the one for the case of Ag3 . But, due to the
higher symmetry of Ag4 the second CO bonds in the same fashion as the ﬁrst.
Each Ag atom will bond a single CO atoms before a second CO will bond to
it. This was the trend for the smaller sizes as well. Ag4 (CO)8 has a very similar
structure to Ag3 (CO)6 , it consists of two pair of CO molecules bonded in the
plane perpendicular to Ag4 and two pairs that are parallel to its plane. In the
cases explored in this work not a single CO bonded in a face or a bridge site, a
fact that can attributed to both the frontier orbitals of CO and Agn .

Fig. 6. The binding energy of CO (per CO ligand) to AgN , N = 1 − 4. The binding
energy is computed as BE(CO) = (x × E(CO) + E(AgN ) − E(AgN (CO)x )/x.

In Fig. 6 we present the binding energy per CO to Agn , n = 1−4 as a function
of the number of CO molecules bonded to the cluster. This quantity is a measure
of the stability of the cluster upon addition of ligand molecules. The ﬁrst thing
we learn from Fig. 6 is that the binding energy of CO to Agn increases with

209

cluster size. However, as more CO molecules are added the binding energy for
all the sizes seem to decrease to approximately the same value. The data in the
ﬁgure also allow us to conclude that the only case in which the system becomes
more stable upon addition of more CO molecules is the Ag atom. This might be
understood in terms of the orbitals that are responsible to the formation of the
carbon-silver bond. Ag2 , Ag3 , and Ag4 all become less stable upon addition of
carbon monoxide. As a consequence at high temperatures one might only observe
AgN CO. Nevertheless, in low temperature conditions or in clusters deposited on
a substrate there is a possibility that these CO-rich clusters might form and play
a role in the reactions involving carbon monoxide.

Concluding Remarks

In this work we studied the structural properties and the interaction of carbon
monoxide with silver clusters. We conclude that low coordination Ag atoms can
bond up to 3 CO’s, being the last CO molecule only weakly bonded. Analysis of
the frontier orbitals explains why in many cases that CO molecule is not aligned
with the Ag-C bond. The binding energy per CO molecule decreases with the
number of CO molecules bonded to the cluster, the only exception is the Ag
atom where the second CO molecule is more strongly bonded than the ﬁrst.
Steric eﬀects explain the structure of the saturated clusters. Ag2 (CO)6 consists
of two Ag(CO)3 structures staggered in a D3 d arrangement. While Ag3 (CO)6
has two pairs of CO molecules bonded perpendicular to the plane of Ag3 and
the 3rd pair is parallel. A similar situation is seen in Ag4 (CO)8 where two pairs
are perpendicular and two pairs are parallel to the plane of Ag4 .
We speculate that the likely saturation of the planar Ag5 and Ag6 clusters to
be 10 and 12 pairs of CO molecules bonded in patterns similar to the ones for
Ag3 and Ag4 . On the other hand, for the tridimensional structures the saturation
point may be a single CO molecule per surface atom due to their higher coordination. Future work will be to extend this work to larger size clusters and to
explore the electronic properties of neutral and charged clusters. In addition, we
would like to explore other ligands and study catalytic properties of small silver
clusters in the gas phase as well as of silver clusters deposited on a substrate.
