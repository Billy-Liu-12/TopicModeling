Abstract. Analytical solutions of the partial diﬀerential equations
(PDEs) governing the behavior of ionic polymer plates have not been
yet obtained and therefore only time consuming discrete numerical methods can be used instead. To avoid the computational cost of numerical
solutions this paper introduces a solution construction method that exploits analytical approximation basis functions borrowed from solutions
of single physics formulations associated with rectangular ionic polymer
plates for artiﬁcial muscle applications. This is achieved by utilizing an
inverse approach that exploits global optimization. An objective function is constructed to express the error between the experimental and
analytical values of the selected state variables. Minimization of this objective function yields an eﬃcient determination of the unknown free
coeﬃcients. Comparisons between the determined approximations and
the experimental data along with computational eﬃciency improvements
conclude this paper.

Introduction

Recent progress on processing and development of various multi-ﬁeld activated
materials such as electro-active polymers (EAP) and ionic polymer conductive
composites (IPCC) for artiﬁcial muscle applications [1, 2, 3] has underlined two
main needs. First, the general need for a rigorous, complete and preferably automated modelling methodology that will eventually accelerate the design, certiﬁcation and prototyping of these materials and the devices or systems built
around them. Second, the need for eﬃcient exercise and application of the models derived from the previous methodology. We have already addressed the ﬁrst
need elsewhere [4, 5, 6] by following standard continuum multiphysics modeling
approaches [7, 8, 9, 10]. The present paper focuses on the second need. Thus, here
an attempt to increase the computational eﬃciency of the process required to exercise models of rectangular plates constructed from various multi-ﬁeld activated
materials is presented.
Previous modeling eﬀorts of EAP or IPCC plates [4, 5] have resulted to a system of partial diﬀerential equations governing their multi-ﬁeld behavior in space

and time. This non-linear system is an extended Von-Karman set of equations.
We have demonstrated [4, 5, 6] that this system is solvable via the the use of
the Finite Element Method (FEM). However, the time required to obtain FEM
solutions has been hindered by two main diﬃculties. First, a general couple PDE
system solver code is required by the investigator at hand. There are commercial
codes (i.e. ”ﬂexPDE“ [11], ”COMSOL Multiphysics“ [12]) and open source free
codes (i.e. ”freeFEM++“ and ”freeFEM3D” [13]) that may exceed the user’s
monetary and/or time (for learning how to use it) investment capability. Second, -assuming that a user owns a code of this type-, the computational cost
can me prohibiting for speciﬁc applications especially because the non-linear and
dynamic character of the associated PDEs.
The goal of this paper is to develop a method that alleviates the second of
these problems by introducing a methodology that avoids the discretization and
the numerical integration of the associated PDEs. The proposed method has been
inspired by the overall ”data-driven“ framework associated with the development
of a general computational environment for multiphysics applications (DDEMA)
that has been preliminarily described elsewhere [14, 15].
The novelty of this paper is three fold. First, it avoids the need to integrate the
multiphysics PDEs describing the dynamics of the system all together. Second,
it proposes a technique based on approximating the solution ﬁelds by sums of
basis functions borrowed from well known single-physics approximations. Third,
it casts the problem as an optimization problem where an objective function is
constructed that expresses the norm of the error vector between the experimental values of the ﬁelds involved in the problem and their respective analytical
approximations constructed as previously described.
The paper presents the coupled and the partially uncoupled multiphysics formulations for a rectangular IPCC plate in Section 2. It subsequently describes
the experimental procedure for acquiring the data to be utilized in Section 3.
The corresponding global optimization problem is being setup and applied and
validated in section 4. Conclusions provide the closure of the paper.

Multi-ﬁeld Coupled and Uncoupled System of PDEs

We have demonstrated in the past [4, 5, 6] that introduction of Lagrange strains
(to account for large deformations) into the general theory of multi-component
species diﬀusion of electro-thermo-elastic continua, with insigniﬁcant ionic
currents and chemical reactivity, excited by generalized loading conditions of
multi-component mass concentrations in the boundaries, electric potential, temperature and mechanical deformation yields the following set of modiﬁed VonKarman nonlinear PDEs :

Here w, F, X k are the deﬂection, the Airy stress function and the additional
generalized ﬁeld state variables and δij , ν, E, h, N, q are Kronecker’s delta, Poisson’s ratio, the modulus of elasticity, the plate thickness, the ﬂexural rigidity
and the distributed load respectively.
When all non-mechanical ﬁelds X k are not present, this system reduces to
the traditional system of the large deﬂection Von-Karman equations. Analytical
approximation solutions of this system are to be used for solving Eqs. (1).

Experimental Procedure for Data Collection

To acquire preliminary experimental data reﬂecting the electrically activated
bending of IPCC plates, an IPCC square specimen was cut with dimensions 50×
50×0.3 mm, where the small number corresponds to the the thickness of the plate
while the other two numbers correspond to the length and width of the plate.
Figure 1(a) presents a view of the IPCC plate mounted on conductive frame
that was used to apply voltage boundary conditions along the entire boundary.
In Fig. 1(b) the experimental setup shown including a load cell used to determine
the deﬂection at the mid-point of the plate surface. The load cell is mounted on
a precision screw type platform capable of applying measurable displacement
towards and away from the center of the plate. Consecutive turns of the screw
were applied all corresponding to a displacement of a about a micron. For each
one of these turns, when zero contact force was ﬁrst observed (the load cell was
not touching the plate) the distance traveled by the load cell becomes equal to
the deﬂection of the plate.
Figure 2(a) shows the experimental results of applying a sinusoidally varying
voltage and the corresponding deﬂection at the middle of the plate as a function
of time. Figure 2(b) shows the voltage vs. the mid-point deﬂection for the ﬁrst
two seconds. These are the data to be used in the process that follows.

Global Optimization for Analytical Approximation of

The inverse approach character of the proposed methodology is based on minimizing in the least-squares sense the objective function

[Fis (c2j ) − Fie ]2 +

where wis (c1j ), Fis (c2j ), Vis (c3j ) are the unknown variables of the simulated ﬁelds
corresponding to the deﬂection, Airy stress function and voltage distributions;
wie , Fie , Vie are the corresponding experimental values of the same variables respectively. Here, the unknowns to be determined by the minimization of Eq. 2
are the free coeﬃcients cij .
In our preliminary experimental implementation the Airy stress function and
the voltage distribution over the domain of the space variables (x, y) were not
measured. Therefore, only the ﬁrst term of Eq. 2 (corresponding to the deﬂections) was used in the actual numerical analysis. This implies that cij = c1j = cj .
We constructed the simulated deﬂection solution wis (c1j ; xi , yi ) indexed for
speciﬁc locations (xi , yi ) as an additive composition of just three basis functions
τj with, (j = 1, 2, 3), that satisfy the boundary conditions of zero deﬂection
along the edges according to
wis (xi , yi ) =

[c1 τ1 (xi , yi ) + c2 τ2 (xi , yi ) + c3 τ3 (xi , yi )] + wiof f set , (3)

where D is the ﬂexural rigility of the plate, q equiv is an equivalent lateral load
distribution per unit of area of a small deﬂections plate that generates deﬂections
identical to our multi-ﬁled plate, and wiof f set was added to capture the possible
existence of any initial deﬂection. The three free coeﬃcients cj , weighting the
basis functions are the unknowns to be determined.
Based on the inﬁnite series analytical solutions constructed for approximating
a solution satisfying the biharmonic equation governing the single physics small

deﬂection bending of rectangular plates given in the past, we chose our basis

with αm = mπb/2a and where a, b are the dimensions of the plate along the x, y
axes respectively.
Since the experimental data for the deﬂection are collected only at the midpoint of the plate we used another solution of an equivalent single physics
approximating solution of the biharmonic equation to generate pseudo experimental data for the rest of the points on the plate according to,

,

where wigaussian noise represents a term injecting noise for the purpose of emulating the error due to the experimental data-acquisition methodology. It is
worthwhile mentioning here that the fact that we use only the ﬁrst 100 terms
of the double series in the relation above is due to the fact that we are not
concerned to capture accurately the deﬂection of the plate but rather in gross
manner. The injected noise is expected and has been chosen to be of equal or
higher magnitude than the approximation error introduced from not considering
more terms.
To eliminate the presence of the equivalent mechanical load distribution from
Eqs. 3 and 5 the Voltage vs. mid-point (maximum) deﬂection observed in
Fig. 2(b) has been approximated by the following second order polynomial
wmax = 0.00000137903Vo2 + 0.00000635696Vo + 0.000000234504.

(6)

Equating this deﬂection with that provided by Eq. 3 at the midpoint, and solving
the resulting equations with respect of q equiv we obtain the following voltage
depended solution for
π 5 D (0.00000137903Vo2 +0.00000635696Vo +0.000000234504 − wiof f set )

Equations 3-7 fully deﬁne the quantities participating in Eq.2 and therefore
determination of the unknown parameters cj can be achieved by using any
quadratic programming methodology for minimizing Eq. 2. In the context of
this work the implementation of the optimization procedure was formulated in
Mathematica [17] via the algorithms that were available in the package Global
Optimization “GO-5.0” [18]. The resulting solution is presented in Table 1 and
the three coeﬃcients are compared with the known values of the ﬁrst 3 terms
of the inﬁnite series that approximates the biharmonic solution. The computational time for determining these coeﬃcients such that the objective function

given by Eq. 2 is minimized, for a problem that evaluates the simulated and
experimental values of deﬂection at 25 points of the plate, on a Pentium IV 3.2
GHz machine was just under 53 seconds. Now that cj s are known the deﬂection
given by Eq. 3 is fully determined. For comparison purposes Fig. 3 shows the
experimental (left) and simulated (right) distributions of the displacement ﬁeld
over the square plate at the same arbitrary time moment.
Clearly, the computationally determined simulated solution tracks the
pseudo-experimental one very well. The jaggedness of the contours in the pseudoexperimental deﬂection distributions shown in Fig. 3(a) is due to the noise introduced in Eq. 5.
The computational cost of such a distribution via Eq. 3 is about 0.005 seconds
while the respective solution due to the appropriate ﬁnite element analysis takes
an average of 195 seconds. The speedup factor is therefore 195/0.005 = 39, 000.
Even if one includes the time for applying the optimization process to determine
the coeﬃcients cj the speedup factor is 195/(53 + 0.005) = 3.67. The advantage
of using a data-driven approximation of the unknown deﬂection ﬁeld in place of
a numerical discretization solution of the associated PDEs via FEM is obvious.

Conclusions

In this eﬀort, we have described a methodology for determining partial analytical
representations approximating the solution of the multi-ﬁeld PDEs governing the

Data-Driven Inverse Modelling of IPCC Plates

137

behavior of the large deﬂection generalized Von-Karman plates constructed from
IPCC. This is achieved by exploiting single physics (just mechanical) solutions
of the biharmonic PDE governing small deﬂection plates to construct analytical approximations for the simulated deﬂection ﬁeld. An optimization scheme
for minimizing an objective function constructed in the least square sense as
a measure of the square diﬀerence between the simulated and experimentally
acquired (and pseudo-experimentally constructed) deﬂection ﬁeld. The resulting
solution tracks very well the experimental ﬁelds. The realized speedup factors
are signiﬁcant and justify the usage of this approach.
An essential limitation of this approach is that due to lack of experimental measurements for the spatial distribution of the Airy stress function and
the voltage ﬁelds, no approximations for these ﬁelds has been derived. Future
eﬀorts will address this limitation. Once this is done then the PDEs themselves can further restrict the coeﬃcients of the approximating solutions and
thus further simplify their form. In addition, instead of only considering approximation solution of the small deﬂection plate theory this method can be
extended to include approximation solutions of the large deﬂection theory of
Von-Karman equations [19, 20]. Another, needed activity is a sensitivity analysis to classify how the increase of the number of the basis functions participating
in the solution eﬀects both the accuracy and the computational time of the entire
process.
