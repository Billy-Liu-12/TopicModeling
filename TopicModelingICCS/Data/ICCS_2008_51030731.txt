1 Introduction
Agile Virtual Enterprise (AVE) is a dynamic organization on the web environment,
which is composed of a number of independent enterprises connected by information
technology based on various hierarchy resources integration and sharing [1]. It’s
important to get the optimum cooperative enterprise scheme by analyzing, arranging
and evaluating character information of candidate enterprise for AVE. At present,
partner selection of the AVE always utilizes integer programming, fuzzy evaluation,
multiple objectives programming, grey relation theory and so on. For example,
P.Gutpa [2] introduces partner selection method in the distributed manufacturing
environment according to evaluation of product manufacturing capability; Kasilingam
[3] discusses partner selection problem in terms of cost by mixed integer
programming method; Hinkle [4] selects partner according to cluster analysis; Siying
[5] discusses partner selection problem by neural networks method; N.Q. Wu [6] puts
forward partner selection algorithm based on graph method; P.J.Ma [7] introduces
partner selection by fuzzy analysis hierarchy process. These methods don’t consider
scheduling relationship among manufacturing tasks, and it’s difficult to evaluate
various indices synthetically by the methods.

Grey relation analysis belongs to grey system theory put forward by Professor
Deng Ju-long [8] in 1982, and it mainly researches quantification analysis problem of
system state development. In grey relation theory, the geometry curve constructed by
several stat. data is more similar, the relation degree is bigger. The relation sequence
reflects approximate sequence of each project to objective project, and the project of
maximal grey relation degree is best one. Ant colony algorithm [9] has character of
positive feedback, distributing compute and heuristic search, and it is successfully
applied in NP-hard problem (such as, traveling salesman problem (TSP), scheduling
problem and job-shop problem). To typical TSP problem about Oliver30、 Eil50 and
Ei175, ant colony algorithm, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm are
compared in optimization quality and convergence speed by simulation analysis in
reference [10], and the experiment result shows that ant colony algorithm is most
satisfied. Partner selection of AVE is directed graph in the nature, which is similar to
TSP. The paper hence adopts nature heuristic approach, which is ant colony
algorithm, to resolve partner selection of AVE driven by working procedure. What’s
more, grey relation theory is applied into the problem at each task vertex to reduce
problem resolved space.

2 Grey Relation Approaches to AVE Partner Pre-election
2.1 Evaluation Framework of AVE Partner Pre-election
AVE partner is mainly pre-elected from time, cost, quality and service. The preselection evaluating index of AVE partner is made up of cost evaluating index,
history evaluating index, time evaluating index and general evaluating index [11], and
the evaluation system is shown as Fig.1
• Cost evaluating index (L1)
The cost index information includes biding price (L11) and transporting fee (L12).
L11 indicates that candidate enterprise put forward processing fee to finish assigned
manufacturing task; L12 is transporting expenses from candidate enterprise to core
enterprise.
• History evaluating index (L2)
History evaluating index is made up of credit for collaboration (L21), capability of
disposing exception (L22), quality of after service (L23) and production quality grade (L24).
The digital rule of above index is: AAAAA(5)、 AAAA(4)、 AAA(3)、 AA(2)、 A(1).
• Time evaluating index (L3)
Time evaluating index is made up of production completion time (L31) and project
postponing dateline (L32).
• General evaluating index (L4)
General evaluating index estimates candidate enterprises from its scope (L41),
enterprise important degree (L42) and equipment capability (L43). Moreover, the
numeralization rule of general evaluating index includes: enterprise important level is
divided into monopolization status (5), domination status (4), leading status (3),
participation status (2), and obedience status (1); Equipment capability is made up of
international leading level (5), international general level (4), internal leading level
(3), internal general level (2), and behindhand status (1).

2.2 Instance Analysis of Partner Selection Based on Grey Relation
Optimum set (reference sequence) is firstly determined in partner grey selection [12].
Cooperative manufacturing partner is filtered by acquiring grey relation coefficient of
three hierarchies according to pre-election evaluating index system discussed in
Section 2.1. The paper discusses AVE partner pre-election problem by giving an
example of working procedure about semi-finishing turning flank groove for one
aeroplane engineer front casket. In terms of final grey relation coefficient, five
enterprises to be satisfied are chosen from ten candidate enterprises, and the detail
information of each candidate enterprises is shown as Table 1.
According to the principle of the lowest cost, shortest manufacturing times,
production excellent quality and most quick response speed, the optimum set is: T*=
{T*1, T*2, T*3, T*4} = {{1.8,0.23},{5,5,5,5},{13,2},{4,5}}, and the precedence
arrangement sequence of each evaluating index is shown as: L11>L12;
L21>L24>L22>L23； L31>L32； L43>L41>L42； L1>L3>L2>L4. The first and second
hierarchy evaluating index judgment matrixes are:

For the manufacturing task about turning flank groove of one aeroplane engineer front
casket, the candidate enterprises pre-elected include: enterprise V, enterprise VIII,
enterprise II, enterprise I and enterprise IX.

3 Application of Ant Colony Algorithm in Selecting AVE Partner
Considering part manufacturing character, working procedures are arranged for
manufacturing chain from the view of the aspect of manufacturing technics, and
manufacturing enterprise need to be selected from node of manufacturing chain. Thus,
the problem of AVE partner selection is considered as directed graph. The metal
cutting working procedure (MCWP) in one aeroplane engineer front casket AVE
includes: drilling and boring the hole of plane to be combined (MCWP1), rough
milling exterior plane (MCWP2), finish milling the plane to be combined (MCWP3),
finish grinding the plane to be combined (MCWP4), boring the plane to be combined
(MCWP5), finish milling exterior plane (MCWP6), finish boring radial hole
(MCWP7), milling groove of the plane to be combined (MCWP8) and finish turning
fore-and-aft groove (MCWP9), and the directed graph of AVE partner selection is
shown as Fig.2.
With the increment of working procedure node, the space of problem about partner
selection expands rapidly, and it belongs to typical NP-Hard compounding
optimization problem. On the basis of AVE partner pre-election in terms of grey
relation theory, the paper makes use of ant colony algorithm to search manufacturing
path of least cost consumed.

Ant departs from vertex of in-degree zero, and its amount is the same as working
procedure. It chooses the next vertex according to information consistency, and the
travel is finished at the vertex of out-degree zero. The task of aeroplane engineer front
casket includes nine working procedure, and the element of candidate enterprise set
Ai（ i=1,2…m） from each working procedure should be selected. What’s more, the
ant chooses the next intention enterprise at the t time, and arrives the destination at the
t+1 time. All the ants travel |Ai| steps at the interval of t and t+1 time, and it is thought
that the algorithm finish one times iterative travel. If the algorithm realizes n times
iterative travel, the ant colony algorithm is defined one times cycle, and update
formula of information consistence is defined:

τ ij (t + n) = ρ ×τ ij (t ) + Δτ ij .

(2)

τ ij (t ) is denoted information consistency from enterprise i to enterprise j,
and Variable ρ is indicated residual information consistency. When t equals to zero,
the original information consistency τ ij (0) =0.6; Δτ ij is increment of information

Variable

consistency, after the algorithm finishes one travel cycle.

Δ kτ ij is indicated k ant leaves information element value from i enterprise to j
enterprise at the internal of t and t+n, and it is calculated:

Q is constant about information consistence that ant leaves, and its value impacts on
the convergence speed of ant colony algorithm. The paper discusses how to select
appropriate collaborating enterprise for each working procedure by utilizing ant
colony algorithm. Ρijk (t ) is indicated the probability of k ant traveling from enterprise i
to enterprise j:

Fig. 3. Ant colony algorithm parameter optimum result analysis based on stat

times for each parameter, and average of experimentation result is computed. The
value range of each parameter is: α ∈ [0,5] , β ∈ [1,10] , ρ ∈ [0,0.9] , Q ∈ [1,1100] , and
stat. analysis of experimentation is shown as Fig.3.
According to simulation result above, the optimization value range of each
parameter is: β ∈ ( 5 − ε ,5 + ε ) ， α ∈ (1 − ε ,1 + ε ) ， ρ ∈ ( 0.3 − ε , 0.3 + ε ) ， Q ∈ [100,1100] .
If β is too high, ant colony will select candidate enterprise of low transporting cost
without considering information consistency. Otherwise, selection probability is
influenced by information consistence too much, and it leads to algorithm converge
too early. If α is too high, information consistence decides ant colony selection
probability, and ant selects the path which the other ant have traveled. Otherwise, ant
colony algorithm changes into classic greedy random algorithm. Volatility coefficient
ρ reflects memory degree of ant colony for experience. If its value is too low, ant
colony algorithm changes into greedy heuristic search, and algorithm cycle times is
more. Otherwise, information consistence volatilizes too quickly, and transporting
cost among enterprises in large determines selection probability. Information
consistence const. Q influences ant colony algorithm search efficiency a little. On the
basis of above analysis, the paper gives one group optimization parameter:
α = 1, β = 5, ρ = 0.3, Q = 800 , and AVE partner selection result is shown as Table 2.

4 Conclusions
The bottleneck of AVE is how to manufacture high quality products at the right time
and place by right manufacturing resource. The paper divided partner enterprise of
AVE into two stages: In first stage, the partner pre-election of AVE problem is
resolved by grey relation theory, ant it reduces problem resolved space and
complexity. According to transport cost among candidate enterprises, partner
selection is realized by ant colony algorithm on the basis of partner candidate set.
Future research is to optimize resource allocation for plant of each AVE partner by
grey relation and grey relation theory for the scheduling and dispatch of cooperative
manufacturing.
