Abstract
A variational multi scale approach to model blood ﬂow through arteries is proposed. A ﬁnite element discretization to represent
the coarse scales (macro size), is coupled to smoothed dissipative particle dynamics that captures the ﬁne scale features (micro
scale). Blood is assumed to be incompressible, and ﬂow is described through the Navier Stokes equation. The proposed coupling is tested with two benchmark problems, in fully coupled systems. Further reﬁnements of the model can be incorporated
in order to explicitly include blood constituents and non-Newtonian behavior. The suggested algorithm can be used with any
particle-based method able to solve the Navier-Stokes equation.
Keywords: Blood ﬂow; Variational Multiscale; Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics.

1. Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are one of the deadliest diseases in the world, killing more people than cancer every
year [1]. Thus, the study of blood ﬂow through the cardiovascular system emerges as an active research ﬁeld
nowadays. Improving our understanding of the physical phenomena occurring at all scales (from arteries to
capillaries), as well as their link to disease, could have a positive impact on public health.
Diﬀerent approaches have been taken to model cardiovascular systems, ranging from merely homogeneous
(or heterogeneous) continuum description [2], [3], to micro scale particle descriptions [4], [5]. Some of these
methodologies have attempted to model blood constituents explicitly, such as red blood cells [6], [7], and, platelets
in regions on the scale of micrometers, in order to recover micro-scale interactions. Alternatively, homogeneous
descriptions of the blood have been done to reproduce global hydrodynamic eﬀects [8]. Hybrid methods that allow
to capture both local and global eﬀects are still under development due to the complexity of the cardiovascular
system [9], [10], [11].

Thrombus formation in large arteries can be described roughly as the coupled interactions at two diﬀerent
ﬀ
scales [12]: local ﬂows involving aggregation-adhesion of blood constituents and global hemodynamics. In general, modelling of thrombus development with traditional description of continuum methods is approximate for
bulk hemodynamics rather than local interactions.
The main goal in this work is to model hemodynamics in a simpliﬁed cardio vascular setting, using a representation that can capture both global and local eﬀects.
ﬀ
Enrichments may allow for clot formation modeling
close to arterial walls. When the local eﬀects
ﬀ
occur at scales in the order of micrometers, the system is governed
by ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics equations [13]. These equations introduce the thermal and mechanical ﬂuctuations responsible for the randomness of the Brownian motion. As the length scale of the system increases, these
ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics converge to the well known Navier-Stokes equation [14].
In order to couple micro and macro scales we use the variational multi scale (VMS) method [15], [16]. The
VMS framework has been used in systems where additional physical features were included to enhance the physical representation, while improving the discrete stability. Relevant examples include the modelling of turbulence
[17], [18], and porous media [19]. In the VMS context the ﬁne scale solution is driven by the residual of the coarse
scales. The solution of the VMS problem requires ﬁne scale solution to be expressed as a projection of the coarse
level.
Previous work coupling or improving the continuum models with particles descriptions can be found in the
literature [20, 21, 22, 23], but none of those used the VMS approach.

2. Hemodynamic modeling
In this context, the dependent variables chosen to be studied are blood velocity and pressure. Additional
information, such as transport properties of the blood ﬂuid, are considered as input data [24] in the proposed
model.
Due to the inherent high complexity in the cardiovascular systems, where multiple space-time scales and ﬂow
regimes are relevant, a set of initial assumptions is made: i) Newtonian ﬂuid, ii) incompressible ﬂow, iii) nonslip boundary condition at macro scale, iv) inertial eﬀects
ﬀ
presents, v) isothermal ﬂow (macroscopically), but
thermally ﬂuctuating at meso-scale level, vi) Homogeneous ﬂow. These assumptions can be eventually relaxed in
the reﬁnement process of the model. In our modeling description, we detail all the assumptions introduced. For
the sake of simplicity, assumption (i) is stated, however, a rigorous model requires to consider the blood as a shear
thinning like-ﬂuid, due to the blood constituents. Newtonian assumption is in general suitable at high shear rates
[24]. In future work including blood constituents, this assumption will no longer be adopted.
2.1. Navier-Stokes
We start out by writing the balance equations for mass and linear momentum, typically known as the NavierStokes equations, based on assumptions i through vi. Angular momentum and energy balances, as well as the

Nicolas Moreno et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2565 – 2574

2567

entropy inequality in the present model are satisﬁed by construction, and thus not evaluated.
The mass balance can be deﬁned as:
∇·v=0

(1)

Assuming an arbitrary domain Ω, the momentum balance is given by:
μ
v t + ∇ · (v ⊗ v) + ∇p − ∇ · (2 ∇ s v) = f
ρ

in

Ω×]0, T [

(2)

where v, p, ρ, μ and f are the ﬂuid velocity, pressure, density, viscosity and external forces respectively.
The proposed hemodynamic describes in a simpliﬁed manner the whole ﬂuid using Navier-Stokes equations.
However, we aim to have a model that can capture the bulk behavior, including the surface contact, and, eventually
thermal ﬂuctuations at the mesoscale. This is why we focus on a meso-scale model, that can enrich the macro-scale
description.
2.2. Variational Multiscale
In order to introduce the VMS approach we formally deﬁne a domain Ω, such that Ω ⊂ Rd , where d ≥ 1 is the
number of space dimensions, with a boundary Γ. The boundary-value problem is deﬁned as:
Find u : Ω → R such that:
Lu = f

Ω

in

u = g on

Γ

(3)
(4)

where f : Ω → R and g : Γ → R are given functions, and L is a second-order operator.
Let S ⊂ H 1 (Ω) be the trial solution space and V ⊂ H 1 (Ω) denote the weighting function space, where H 1 (Ω)
is the Sobolev space of square-integrable functions with square-integrable derivatives. We assume that S and V
possess the following properties: u = g on Γ ∀ u ∈ S , and w = 0 on Γ ∀ w ∈ V
The variational form of the current boundary-value problem can be written as:
Find u ∈ S such that ∀w ∈ V
a(w, u) = (w, f )

(5)

Now, based on the VMS formulation [15], an additional assumption is included:
viii The solution of the diﬀerent ﬁelds can be decomposed as a summation of multi-scale contributions.
Considering this, the problem can be stated as:
u = u¯ + u

(6)

w = w¯ + w

(7)

where u¯ represents coarse scales and u represents ﬁne scales (see Fig. 2). This interpretation assumes that the
coarse scale accounts for the smooth (and macro scale) behavior of the system, while the ﬁne scale considers the
highly oscillatory (and micro scale) part.
We use the following domain decomposition:
S = S¯
S
V = V¯
V
where ¯ and represent the coarse and ﬁne scales, respectively. Following [15], some extra assumptions are
made:
¯ and w = 0 on Γ ∀ w ∈ V
ix u¯ = g on Γ ∀ u¯ ∈ S¯ , u = 0 on Γ ∀ u ∈ S , w¯ = 0 on Γ ∀ w¯ ∈ V,

By substituting equations ( 6) and ( 7) in ( 5) we get:
¯ ∀w ∈ V
a(w¯ + w , u¯ + u ) = (w¯ + w , f ) ∀w¯ ∈ V,

(8)

Then, if w¯ and w’ are linearly independent, we have:
a(w,
¯ u¯ ) + a(w,
¯ u ) = (w,
¯ f ) ∀w¯ ∈ V¯

(9)

a(w , u¯ ) + a(w , u ) = (w , f ) ∀w ∈ V

(10)

leading to:
a(w,
¯ u¯ ) + (L∗ w,
¯ u ) = (w,
¯ f ) coarse scale problem

(11)

a(w , L¯u) + (w , Lu ) = (w , f ) f ine scale problem

(12)

where L∗ (·) is the adjoin operator. Equation ( 12) is usually expressed as:
Π Lu = −Π (L¯u − f ) in Ω

(13)

u = 0 on Γ

(14)

The above equations illustrate that the ﬁne scale problem is basically driven by the residual of the coarse
scales, which can be seen as a new boundary value problem with an additional force term acting over the system.
Following the VMS approach previously derived, now it is possible to write the weak formulation for the ﬂow
problem
w = (w, q)

(19)

Equation (18) corresponds to the coarse scale problem, but is not the same as (11), due to the presence of cross
terms: (¯v ⊗ v + v ⊗ v¯ ). In the proposed coupling procedure, equation (18) is discretized by ﬁnite element method,
that can be found elsewhere [25]. On the other hand, although an equivalent expression of (18) can be formulated
for the ﬁne scale weak form, a particle-based discretization is proposed instead.
3. Fine-scale model: Smoothed dissipative particle dynamics
As is stated before in the VMS problem, it is necessary to deﬁne a ﬁne scale formulation that can be used in
equation (18); the aim is to get the ﬁne scale solution of the system by a relatively new particle method, smoothed
dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) [26].
SDPD is a method that combines features of the well known smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) [27],
and dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) [28]. This combination leads to a particle discretization of the NavierStokes equation, with the capability to consistently reproduce thermal ﬂuctuation at the mesoscopic level [29].
In the case of blood ﬂow, it is known that some of its main components, like red blood cells and platelets, are
actually inﬂuenced by thermal ﬂuctuations [30]. This kind of ﬂuctuation must eventually be considered when
local interactions at the level of wall interfaces are studied; thus, it is necessary to have a model capable of
capturing meso-scales features.
3.1. SDPD model
In the framework of particle-based methods, an arbitrary function f (x) can be represented by means of an
integral interpolant in terms of a kernel function W(x, h) [31], such that:
f (x) =

Ω

f (x )W(x − x , h)dx

(20)

The interpolant reproduces f (x) exactly if the kernel is a delta function. In practical applications, the kernels
are functions that are normalized to one in order to interpolate constants, and tend to delta functions as the support
h goes to zero. In order to discretize any partial diﬀerential equation by a particle description, it is common to
deﬁne an adequate kernel function W(r) over which any property can be evaluated at the position of the particle,
as a local average within some support h. For each particle we can deﬁne a mass m p , a number of particle density
di = j W( r − r j ), and the volume of a particle Vi = d1i . The previous statement only satisﬁes Vi = Vtotal when
the number of particles N tends to inﬁnity. However, it can be assumed that above certain threshold Vi ≈ Vtotal .
This threshold or minimum number of particles required can be easily ﬁxed by choosing a tolerance value tvol such
that:
Vi
Vtotal

≤ tvol

(21)

Based on this kernel function, any property A(r) can be expressed as:
A(r) =

j

W(|r − r j |)A(r j )
W(|r − r j |)

(22)

In addition, in order to represent a partial diﬀerential equation, it is useful to approximate any derivative of the
property, by taking the derivative of the kernel function W(r). Lets deﬁne the gradient of W as:
∇W(r) = −F(r)r

(23)

A common selection for this kernel function is the Lucy equation, widely used in SPH [26]:
W(r) =

1
r
105
(1 + 3 )(1 − )3
h
h
16πh2

(24)

2570

Nicolas Moreno et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2565 – 2574

where h is the support domain such that h << L, being L the domain length. With the selected kernel function,
F(r) can be written as:
F(r) =

315
(1 − r/h)2
4πh5

(25)

Although, the SDPD discretization for the Navier-Stokes equation proposed by Espanol and Ravenga (2003)
[26] is suitable for compressible ﬂow, it is possible to take an approach frequently used with the lattice Boltzmann
or with SPH [32], and consider the system as a weakly-compressible ﬂow. The system is eventually compatible
with the incompressibility assumption, if the time step size and the Mach number used are small enough [33]. The
Navier-Stokes equation for the weakly-compressible system can be written in the SDPD form as:
m

d
vi =
dt

(
j

Pi P j
+ )Fi j ri j − (2μ)
di2 d2j

j

Fi j vi j
di d j

(26)

where μ is the ﬂuid viscosity, P is the pressure of the system and can be expressed as Pi = Pi (di ), where Pi (di ) is
a regular equation of state. Here we choose a Tait’s equation[34], with the form:
⎡
⎤
⎥⎥
c20 ρ0 ⎢⎢⎢ ρ 7
− 1⎥⎥⎥⎦
(27)
P=
⎢⎢⎣
7
ρ0
where c0 is the artiﬁcial speed of sound for the ﬂuid, and ρ0 is a reference density. As one of the initial assumptions
of the present model is the incompressibility of the ﬂow, the value of a should be selected in order to get small
Mach number (Ma ≤ 0.01).
The presented SDPD discretization can be found in the paper of Espanol and Ravenga, the discretization for
the second derivatives has a solid interpretation, and the general model for SDPD can be generalized with thermal
ﬂuctuations. It is the aim of the model proposed in this paper, that the thermal ﬂuctuation be consistently included
in a more reﬁned model in a straightforward manner. The development of a coupling procedure between ﬁnite
elements and SDPD has this capability by construction.
3.2. Fine Scale boundary condition
Since the cardiovascular systems of interest go roughly from sizes of the order of capillaries to the size of
arteries, it is assumed for convenience that each ﬁnite element of the coarse scale constitutes a SDPD simulation
box. Due to the scaling of thermal ﬂuctuations [29], this assumption may take out the meso-scale features if this
model is extended to larger domains. In that case mathematical homogenization procedures may be implemented,
where each SDPD simulation can be used as a cell problem.
The proposed scale decomposition assumes that the ﬁne scale feels or is driven by the residual of the coarse
scale, with the ﬁne scale not contributing anything beyond the boundaries of the elements. This assumption
although strong, allows us to deﬁne the boundary for the particle ﬁne scale domain, by setting walls of zero
velocity particles at the edges of the box, interacting smoothly with the rest of ﬂuid particles.
The boundary condition (BC) proposed, is neither non-slip nor slip condition in a rigorous sense, due to the
smoothed kernel used in the interaction with the frozen wall.

4. Coupling algorithm
For the coupling procedure, an additional assumption can be included, making the variables independent of
time at the coarse scale:
x Due to the separation in time scales between the ﬁne and the coarse scale, the coarse scale is assumed to
be in steady state, while the ﬁne scale is ﬂuctuating at high frequencies, and can be modeled as a transient
system, tending to the equilibrium at time teq , such that: Δt f ine << teq << Δtcoarse

The proposed algorithm for coupling ﬁnite elements with smoothed dissipative particle dynamics is:
1. Solve

4. Increase Δt f ine if:
Δv(r)

where δ f ine is a tolerance value, v(r) is the velocity at any arbitrary point r, evaluated with the equation (30)
and Δv(r) is the diﬀerence of the velocity between the current and the previous time step.
5. Interpolate v and p over the Gauss points of the element, equation (30)
6. Repeat from step 1 with the new v and p , until coarse scale convergence is reached, when:
(32)
Ri ≤ δcoarse
where δcoarse is a tolerance value and Ri is the residual of the coarse scale elements
5. Simulations
To test the proposed coupling algorithm, driven cavity and 2D Poiseuille ﬂow are studied, following the
coupling algorithm proposed in the previous section. An initial set of simulations were carried out where the
whole domain includes both coarse and ﬁne scales. This scheme allows to study a fully two-way coupled system.
5.1. Simulation details
Coarse scales were discretized using Taylor-Hood ﬁnite elements (quadratic and cubic polynomials for pressure and velocity spaces respectively). Re = 101 to Re = 103 were evaluated in square domains of (1cm)2 , in
meshes of sizes 82 , 162 , 322 , 642 and 1282 . Fully coupled simulations used ﬁnite elements with particles resolution ranging from 500 to 4000 sdpd particles in the whole domain.
Parameters for ﬁne scales were adopted to satisfy weakly incompressible blood ﬂow (density ﬂuctuations, δρi <
1%), and the maximum time step limited to Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy conditions [35]. The set up for sdpd simulations was: ﬂuid kinematic viscosity μ = 3x10−3 Pa · s [24], density ρ = 1060kg/m3 , δt = 5x10−6 s, and artiﬁcial
speed of sound c = 0.1m/s, leading in all the simulations to Mach numbers of Ma ≈ 0.1. The support for the
kernel function was h = 3x10−5 m, and the particle mass ranged from m p = 2x10−4 kg to 2x10−5 kg, depending
on the number of particles in the system. The implementation of the zero velocity walls, was done by setting 4
additional layers of frozen particles at each side of the box.

5.2. Results
Mesh size smaller than 322 , evidenced a poor resolution for the coarse-scale solution in the benchmark problem
evaluated. In addition, when a small number of elements was used, the ﬁne-scale was not able to countervail the
lack in accuracy. The later is expected since the magnitude of the residual was similar for the diﬀerent
ﬀ
sizes.
In general, the ﬁne-scale velocity proﬁles reached equilibrium around 0.1s (105 time steps), however, it was
evident the need to use smaller time steps in order to ensure the simulation stability, as the coarse scale residual
increase when Re does so.
The results obtained, showed that the coupling of sdpd ﬁne scales did not generate instabilities in the global
solution in any of the simulated systems. Furthermore, the resolved coarse scales are preserved (ﬁgure 3), while
the ﬁne scales are completely driven by the coarse scale residual. Figure (4) illustrates the reproduced coarse scale
velocity, and the induced velocity proﬁle in ﬁne scale, leading to vortex formation. In Poiseuille ﬂow simulations,
counterﬂow close to the walls in ﬁne scale level occurred at Re = 1000.

Fig. 3. Horizontal coarse-scale ﬂuid velocity along the vertical center line for Re = 103 . For the sake of comparison, the velocity proﬁles
before (coarse) and after (coupled) ﬁne scale coupling are presented.

The implemented procedure, although fully coupled, is behaving as one-way coupling. Only the ﬁnes scales are
modiﬁed by the coarse level, while the macro-scale is not aﬀected
ﬀ
signiﬁcantly. Nevertheless, in the limit where
the ﬁne scales get coarser (the mass of the particles increases), the trivial solution is recovered and the ﬁne scale
is no longer aﬀected.
ﬀ
It is worth mentioning that the inclusion of the ﬁnes scales showed a small decrease of the
global error in the coarse scale. Further error analysis will be addressed in future work.
6. Conclusions
The proposed model allows a consistent coupling of particle-based methods such as SDPD with the continuum
ﬁnite element method, that permits one to include relevant features of mesoscale. In the scope of the simulations
setup used, the method behaves as a one-way coupling. In order to get a better description of blood ﬂow, the
current model requires improvements by considering non-newtonian ﬂuid, explicit modeling of blood constituents

and pulsatile ﬂow; these aspects will be addressed in future work. One of the most important drawbacks in the
stability of this model is the use of the weakly-compressible form of the SDPD model, penalizing the permissible
time step. To avoid possible ﬁne scale instabilities, it is necessary to include a fully incompressible particle
description. The proposed coupling method is suitable for any particle-based method that can discretize a NavierStokes equation.
