Abstract
A modern numerical scheme for simulation of ﬂow of two immiscible and incompressible phases in inhomogeneous porous media is proposed. The method is based on a combination of the mixed-hybrid ﬁnite element (MHFE)
and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods. The combined approach allows for accurate approximation of the ﬂux
at the boundary between neighboring ﬁnite elements, especially in heterogeneous media. In order to simulate the
non-wetting phase pooling at material interfaces (i.e., the barrier eﬀect), we extend the approach proposed in Hoteit
and Firoozabadi (2008) by considering the extended capillary pressure condition. The applicability of the MHFEDG method is demonstrated on benchmark solutions and simulations of laboratory experiments of two-phase ﬂow in
highly heterogeneous porous media.

1. Introduction
Understanding and protection of drinking water resources is one of the most important modern missions of the
mathematical modeling of ﬂow in the subsurface. Due to industrial activities, the water saturated aquifers are endangered by substances with a very low solubility in water such as oil or chlorinated hydrocarbons. When these
substances, generally referred to as Non-Aqueous Phase Liquids (NAPLs), enter the aquifer, they can serve as a longtime source of groundwater contamination. A prediction of their behavior in the subsurface is an important step
towards their partial or complete removal from the contaminated area. Therefore, two-phase processes have been
studied intensively in engineering, soil physics, and hydrogeology over several decades [1], [2]. The propagation of
NAPLs through water saturated zones is usually driven by two primary mechanisms. The NAPL is displaced due
to external forces (externally imposed ﬂow, gravity) and capillarity. Especially in heterogeneous porous media, the
capillary forces have an important impact on the ﬂow across interfaces between materials with diﬀerent capillarity
properties, [3]. Besides the groundwater protection, two-phase ﬂow models play an important role in the petroleum
reservoir engineering and deep CO2 sequestration [4].

In order to model two-phase ﬂow in heterogeneous porous materials, a large number of numerical methods has
been developed based on the ﬁnite diﬀerence (FD), ﬁnite volume (FV), or ﬁnite element (FE) methods. These methods
have typically low accuracy. The FD method is applicable only for orthogonal meshes and the conventional FV
method is strongly inﬂuenced by the mesh quality and orientation, which makes these methods unsuitable for a large
number of real world problems modeled using unstructured grids. There have been attempts to improve accuracy
of the FV approach on unstructured meshes by using multi-point ﬂux approximation techniques. Another eﬀort to
develop a higher–order numerical scheme was based on the mixed-hybrid ﬁnite element (MHFE) method such as [5].
However, none of the proposed MHFE formulations were able to simulate two-phase ﬂow in heterogeneous porous
media with discontinuities in saturations at material interfaces that are caused by diﬀerent capillary pressure functions.
Recently, Hoteit and Firoozabadi [6], [7], [8], developed a higher–order numerical method that combines the MHFE
approach and the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, together denoted as MHFE-DG. Their approach can be used
to model two–phase ﬂow in a heterogeneous porous medium with sharp jumps in saturation across material interfaces.
We build upon their ideas and extend their approach so that the scheme can simulate the non-wetting phase pooling at
material heterogeneity. The use of MHFE-DG allows for accurate representation of the phase velocities across sides
of ﬁnite elements and approximates saturation as piecewise discontinuous per elements. This facilitates discretization
of the two-phase ﬂow problems especially in case of heterogeneous porous materials and fractured media, where the
saturation is often discontinuous across sharp heterogeneity interfaces.
The paper is organized in the following way. In Section 2, we review the two-phase ﬂow equations and extended capillary pressure condition at heterogeneity interfaces. In Section 3, we reformulate the problem using the
ﬂow potentials and specially introduced velocities. In Section 4, we describe derivation of the numerical scheme,
resulting system of linear equations, and the computational algorithm. In Section 5, we use benchmark solutions
to verify convergence of the numerical scheme in both homogeneous and heterogeneous cases. In Section 6, we
present application of the MHFE-DG scheme for simulation of a laboratory experiment of two–phase ﬂow in a highly
heterogeneous porous medium.
2. Model Equations
The mathematical model of multi-phase ﬂow in porous media is based on the assumption that every ﬂuid phase
is governed by the continuity theorem and the Darcy law. In the following, we consider a wetting phase and a nonwetting phase indexed by w and n, respectively. The α-phase mass balance for α ∈ {w, n} has the following form
∂(φ α S α )
+ ∇·(
∂t

α

uα ) =

α Fα ,

(1)

and the Darcy law for the phase α reads as
uα = −

kr,α
K(∇pα −

g) = −λα K(∇pα −

α

g),

(2)

where φ [−] is the porosity of the medium, K [m2 ] is the intrinsic permeability tensor, and g [m s−2 ] is the gravitational
acceleration vector. For α ∈ {w, n}, the symbols α , S α , uα , Fα , μα , kr,α , and pα stand for the α-phase density [kg m−3 ],
saturation [−], apparent macroscopic velocity [m s−1 ], speciﬁc source/sink term [s−1 ], dynamic viscosity [kg m−1 s−1 ],
relative permeability [−], and pressure [kg m−1 s−2 ], respectively. The term kr,α /μα is frequently denoted as the αphase mobility λα . By deﬁnition, S w + S n = 1. We use the Burdine model for the relative permeability functions
3+ 2

kr,w (S w,e ) = S w,eλ ,

1+ 2

kr,n (S w,e ) = (1 − S w,e )2 (1 − S w,eλ ),

(3)

where the parameter λ [−] is determined experimentally and S w,e is the eﬀective wetting-phase saturation deﬁned as
S w,e = (S w − S wr )/(1 − S wr ), where S wr is the irreducible wetting-phase saturation.
The eﬀects of capillarity are modeled by the capillary pressure pc = pn − pw which is considered to be a function
of saturation S w . A commonly acknowledged model for drainage processes for pc = pc (S w ) is the Brooks and Corey
model
−1
pc (S w,e ) = pd S w,eλ for S w,e ∈ (0, 1],

where λ is the same parameter as in (3) and pd [Pa] is the entry pressure. The entry pressure pd is the capillary
pressure at full saturation and it is the minimal capillary pressure required to displace the wetting phase from the
largest occurring pore. It plays an important role in the ﬂow of non-wetting phases through material interfaces. Let
us consider an initially fully water saturated column with two sands separated by a sharp interface. Since no mass is
lost or produced at the material interface, the mass conservation law states that the normal component of the mass ﬂux
α uα · n is continuous across the interface, where n denotes a unit normal to the interface (see Figure 1). Assuming
that a mobile wetting phase is present on both sides of the interface, it follows that pw is also continuous across the
interface (c.f. [9]). Moreover, if a non-wetting phase is present on both sides of the interface, pn is also assumed to be
continuous which implies the continuity of the capillary pressure pc in that case. On the other hand, if the non-wetting
phase is not present but approaches the material interface from the coarse sand side (denoted by the superscript I),
the interfacial capillary pressure pcI increases. When pcI is lower than pdII of the ﬁner medium, the non-wetting phase
cannot penetrate the interface and accumulates there. In this case both pc and pn are discontinuous. This is referred
to as the barrier eﬀect [9]. Once the capillary pressure pcI exceeds the entry pressure threshold pdII , the non-wetting
phase enters the ﬁner medium and the capillary pressure pc is continuous, i.e., pcI = pcII , while the saturation can be
still discontinuous. In Figure 2, typical Brooks and Corey capillary pressure curves (4) for two diﬀerent porous media
are shown. Altogether, the condition at the material interface is established in the following form:
S nII = 0 and
pcI = pcII ,

pcII = pdII ,

if pcI < pdII ,
otherwise.

Eq. (5) is referred to as the extended capillary pressure condition [9]. A unique value of the wetting phase
saturation S wI,∗ can be associated with the threshold value of the capillary pressure such that S wI,∗ = (pcI )−1 (pdII ), see
Figure 2. The threshold saturation S wI,∗ indicates whether the non-wetting phase can penetrate the material interface
(S wI ≤ S wI,∗ ) or the barrier eﬀect is simulated (S wI > S wI,∗ ).
3. Problem Formulation
We assume that both ﬂuids are incompressible, we introduce the ﬂow potential ψα as ψα = pα − α g·x, where
x is the position vector and α ∈ {w, n}. Similarly to the deﬁnition of the capillary pressure, we deﬁne the capillary
potential as
(6)
ψc = ψn − ψw = pc − (ρn − ρw )g·x.
Consequently, the system of equations can be rewritten in the following form
φ

∂S α
+ ∇·uα = Fα ,

uα = −λα K∇ψα ,
ψc = ψn − ψw ,

where α ∈ {w, n} and the unknown functions are the saturations S α = S α (t, x) and the phase potentials ψα = ψα (t, x)
for all t > 0 and x inside a domain Ω ⊂ Rd , d = 1, 2, 3. Equations (7) are subject to an initial condition

where Γuα , ΓS w , and Γψα denote the subsets of the domain boundary ∂Ω where the boundary conditions for uα , S w , and
ψα are prescribed, respectively, α ∈ {w, n}. The initial condition (8) and boundary conditions (9) should be consistent
with (7c) and (7d).
Summing (7a) over α = {w, n} and using (7d), we obtain the following equation for the divergence of the total
velocity ut = uw + un ,
∇·ut = ∇·(uw + un ) = Fw + Fn in Ω.
(10)
We deﬁne new velocities ua and uc
ua = −λt K∇ψw ,

uc = −λt K∇ψc ,

(11)

where the velocity ua has the same driving force as the velocity uw but with a smoother total mobility λt = λw + λn
and the velocity uc includes the capillary driving forces. Hence, the total velocity ut reads as ut = ua + fn uc , where
fn = λn /λt is the fractional ﬂow function of the non-wetting phase. Note that deﬁnition (11) is diﬀerent from the
deﬁnition of ucHF = −λn K∇ψc , in [8]. In (11) the term λt K is invertible unlike the term λn K in ucHF which may
degenerate.
Consequently, the phase velocities uw and un , can be expressed in terms of ua and uc as
uw = fw ua ,

un = fn ua + fn uc ,

(12)

where fw = λw /λt is the fractional ﬂow function of the wetting phase. The evolution equation for the wetting phase
saturation (7a) in terms of ua reads as
∂S w
+ ∇·( fw ua ) = Fw .

4. Discretization
We consider a spatial discretization Kh of the polygonal domain Ω consisting of elements K, where K are segments
in R or triangles in R2 and h > 0 is the mesh size deﬁned as the maximum element diameter. We assume that the
mesh is regular and conforming. We denote by Vh the set of all vertices V of Kh , by Eh the set of all sides of Kh , and
ext
by Eint
h and Eh the set of interior and exterior sides of Kh , respectively. By EK , we denote the set of all sides of an
element K ∈ Kh .
4.1. Velocity Approximation
We assume, that the velocities uα , where α ∈ {w, n}, belong to the functional space H(div, Ω). On each element
K ∈ Kh , we shall approximate the phase velocities uα in the lowest order Raviart–Thomas space RT0 (K) ⊂ H(div, K).
The basis functions wK,E ∈ RT0 (K) are chosen such that ∀E, F ∈ EK

where nK,E is the outward unit normal to side E ∈ EK with respect to element K, d denotes the space dimension, δEF
is the Kronecker symbol, and | · |d is a d-dimensional Lebesque measure. For convenience, we set |E|0 = 1 for all
E ∈ EK . Assuming that the velocity uα is approximated in the basis of RT0 (K) as
uα =

uα,K,E wK,E ,

α ∈ {a, c},

(15)

E∈EK

where uα,K,E are the side–ﬂux variables across the side E ∈ EK in the outward direction with respect to K.
By inverting the permeability tensor K and the total mobility λt in (11), we obtain

λ−1
t K ua = −∇ψw ,

(16)

where K is positive deﬁnite tensor and λt is strictly positive. The variational formulation is obtained by multiplying
(16) by the test functions from RT0 (Kh ) that are represented on each element K ∈ Kh by the RT0 (K) basis functions
wK,E . We integrate the resulting product by parts over K and using the properties of the RT0 (K) basis functions (14)
we obtain from the left–hand–side of (16):

ψw , respectively. The coeﬃcients {AK,E,F }E,F∈EK in (17) form a symmetric and positive deﬁnite matrix AK on K [8].
Therefore, AK is invertible and by aK = {aK,E,F }E,F∈EK , we denote its inversion. The coeﬃcients aK,E,F depend only
on the mesh Kh and the value of the intrinsic permeability tensor K. Using this notation, the side–ﬂuxes ua,K,E satisfy

sides, i.e., ψw,K1 ,E = ψw,K2 ,E = ψw,E , for all neighboring elements K1 and K2 of E ∈ Eint
h . Additionally, we drop out the
element index K from the side–average potential ψw,K,E = ψw,E also for all external (boundary) sides E ∈ Eext
h .
Similarly, by virtue of the deﬁnition of uc in (11), the expression of uc in RT0 (K) reads as

where ψc,K,F denotes the potential ψc averaged over side F with respect to element K for all F ∈ EK . Due to the
extended capillary pressure condition at a material interface placed at side E ∈ Eint
h , the side-average capillary potential ψc,E can be discontinuous when the barrier eﬀect is simulated. This situation requires careful treatment and
is described in the following section. We drop out the element index K from the side-average potential ψc,K,E = ψc,E
also for all external (boundary) sides E ∈ Eext
h .
4.2. System of Equations for Capillary Potentials
Let us consider two neighboring elements K1 and K2 . Assuming that no mass is produced or lost on an internal
side E ∈ EK1 ∩ EK2 , we consider the following balance of the normal components of ua and uc across E (c.f. [8]):
uα,K1 ,E + uα,K2 ,E = 0,

α ∈ {a, c}.

(21)

In order to establish a system of linear equations in terms of the side-average potentials ψc,K,E for all E ∈ Eint
h ,
E ∈ EK1 ∩ EK2 , we combine (20) with (21):

(22)

F∈EK2

If the capillary potential is continuous across side F ∈ EK1 ∩ EK2 , the side-average potentials ψc,K1 ,F and ψc,K2 ,F
coincide and we denote their common value as ψc,F . In case of the barrier eﬀect at side F, the capillary potential is
discontinuous across F and by ψc,F we denote the side–average capillary pressure potential that corresponds to the
element with lower entry pressure. Altogether, the following side-average potentials ψc,K1 ,E and ψc,K2 ,E are used in the
expression for the side-velocities in (22):
⎧

In (22), the cell–average capillary potential ψc,K can be directly computed using (6) for a given cell–average value of
the saturation S w,K .
Together with the boundary conditions used to close the system of equations (23) for the unknown side-average
potentials ψc,K,E , we obtain a system of linear equations that can be written in a matrix form as
Mc Ψc = bc ,

(24)

where the square, sparse, symmetric, and positive deﬁnite matrix Mc and the vectors Ψc and bc have dimensions #Eh ,
where #Eh denotes the total number of sides in Eh . The components of the vector Ψc are the side average potentials
ψc,E for all E ∈ Eh .
4.3. System of Equations for Wetting-Phase Potentials
In order to express ua,K,E given by (19) in terms of the side–average variables ψw,E and ψc,E , we derive an explicit
formula for the cell-average of the wetting phase potential ψw,K . We integrate the volumetric balance equation (10)
for the total velocity ut over K ∈ Kh and use the divergence theorem and the expressions of ua and uc in RT0 (K) to
obtain

Ma is sparse, symmetric, and positive deﬁnite.

4.4. Saturation Approximation
We discretize the saturation equation (13) using the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method which is locally conservative and ﬂexible for complex unstructured geometries. The DG method approximates the weak solution S w (t, x)
of (13) in a functional space D1 (Kh ) of discontinuous functions that are piecewise linear on K ∈ Kh . By ϕK,E , we
denote the piecewise linear basis functions of D1 (Kh ) associated with the edges for all K ∈ Kh and E ∈ EK . We
choose ϕK,E such that 1/|E|d-1 E ϕK,F = δEF for all K ∈ Kh , E, F ∈ EK , and d = 1, 2. In order to obtain the variational
formulation of the continuity equation on each element K, we multiply (13) by the basis functions ϕK,E ∈ D1 (Kh ),
E ∈ EK , integrate over K, and using the Green theorem:

We use the explicit forward Euler method to solve the system of ODEs (31) where the initial condition is given by the
initial condition for the saturation (8). Due to the higher–order approximation of the saturation in the discontinuous
Galerkin method, the numerical scheme produces non-physical oscillations near shocks, [10], [8]. These spurious
oscillations can be avoided by reconstructing the approximated discontinuous Galerkin solution using a slope limiter
procedure. To stabilize the MHFE-DG numerical scheme, we use the slope limiter introduced by Chavent and Jaﬀr´e,
[11], in the form described in [10].

4.5. Computational Algorithm
We summarize the complete computational algorithm for obtaining the numerical solution of the two-phase ﬂow
system (7) using the MHFE-DG method. The computation proceeds in the following order:
1. Compute the mesh-dependent coeﬃcients aK,E,F , aK,E , and aK for all K ∈ Kh and E, F ∈ EK .

solutions that can be obtained if several assumptions are placed upon the problem formulation (7). These benchmark
solutions can be derived for a one-dimensional two-phase ﬂow problem without sources or sinks (Fw = Fn = 0) and

Figure 3: Numerical solution of the McWhorter and Sunada problem in a homogeneous (a) and heterogeneous (b) porous medium.

with zero gravity (g = 0) for homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, see [12], [13], and [14]. In both benchmark problems we assume that the air (μa = 1.8205·10−5 kg m−1 s−1 and ρa = 1.2 kg m−1 ‘) displaces water (μw = 0.001 kg m−1 s−1
and ρw = 1000 kg m−3 ) from a one-dimensional domain.
In homogeneous case, we test the numerical scheme by means of the McWhorter and Sunada [15] exact solution
in a one-dimensional domain Ω = [0, 1] with the following choice of the parameters: R = 0.92, S 0 = 0.5, S i = 1, and

A = 1.53 · 10−3 ms− 2 (for the deﬁnition of these parameters, we refer to [13]). The properties of the porous medium
are given in Table 2, Sand F. In the MHFE-DG numerical scheme, we set S wini = S i = 1 and at x = 0, we prescribe the

(x = 1 m), we set uN

air-front stays inside Ω.
In case of heterogeneous porous medium, we consider the Fuˇc´ık et al. semi-analytical solution described in [14]
with the following choice of parameters: R = 0.9, S iI = 0.3, and S iII = 1 (for the deﬁnition of these parameters,
we refer to [14]). The properties of the Sand F in ΩI = [0, 1/2] and Sand G in ΩII = [1/2, 1] are given in Table 2.
In the numerical model, we use the following initial and boundary conditions. Initially, S w (0, x) = 0.3 in ΩI and
S w (0, x) = 1 in ΩII . At x = 0, we set S wD (t, 0) = 0.3 and ψD (t, 0) = 0 Pa. The boundary conditions at x = 1 read as

We compute the numerical solutions on a series of regular meshes with decreasing mesh sizes and constant ratio
Δt/h2 and compare them to the semi-analytical solution in Figure 3. We present the experimental orders of convergence (eoc) in Table 1 and show that the MHFE-DG method converge towards the exact solution.
6. Simulation of Laboratory Experiment
As an example of applicability of the MHFE-DG method, we choose to simulate the random medium laboratory
experiment described in [16], [17], and [3]. We model immiscible and incompressible injection of a light NAPL
(LNAPL) with (μn = 0.0035 kg m−1 s−1 and ρn = 830 kg m−3 ) into an initially fully water saturated two dimensional
domain. The domain consists of a stochastically generated heterogeneous layer that is inclined between two homogeneous ones, see Figure 4b. Properties of sands are given in Table 2. Throughout the domain, a slow ﬂow from right to
left is imposed by an increased water head at the right-hand-side boundary. At t = 0, LNAPL starts to be injected into

the source zone (see Figure 4b) with a constant rate of 53 mg s−1 up to t = 9490 s. Then, the inﬂux was stopped. Since
our improved MHFE-DG approach is designed to capture sharp material interfaces between neighboring elements,
we use the mesh shown in Figure 4a that exactly coincides with the random distribution of the heterogeneous sand
blocks. In Figure 5, we plot the LNAPL saturation distribution at t = 0.5h, 2h, 4h, and 5h. The LNAPL patterns are in
a good agreement with the laboratory measured non-wetting phase saturation patterns presented in [16], [17], and [3].
7. Conclusion
We used the mixed-hybrid ﬁnite element (MHFE) method together with the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) approach
to develop a modern numerical scheme capable of simulating ﬂow of two immiscible and incompressible ﬂuids in
heterogeneous porous materials. We extended the approach described in [8] so that the barrier pooling at material
interfaces can be simulated. We used the previously developed benchmark solutions to investigate the convergence
of the MHFE-DG numerical scheme towards the exact solution in both homogeneous and layered materials. In order
to demonstrate applicability of the MHFE-DG method in a highly heterogeneous medium, we simulated a laboratory
experiment described in [16], [17], and [3]. The numerical approximation of the NAPL distribution shows remarkably
good correspondance to the laboratory measured NAPL saturations in [17] indicating that the barrier eﬀect is simulated
correctly.
