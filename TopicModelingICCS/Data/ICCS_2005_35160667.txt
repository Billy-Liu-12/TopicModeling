Abstract. An unusual boundary-value problem that arises in a ﬂuidmechanical application is solved to high precision, as a challenge problem
in scientiﬁc computation. A second-order diﬀerential equation must be
solved on (0, ∞), subject to boundary conditions that specify only the
asymptotic behaviour of the solution at the two ends of the solution
domain. In addition, the solution is required to high accuracy to settle a conjecture made by previous authors. The solution is obtained by
computing multiple series solutions using Maple.

Introduction

Computations of ﬂuid ﬂow sometimes lead to unusual problems in the solution
of ordinary diﬀerential equations. The present problem comes from a paper by
O’Neill and Stewartson [1]. The problem posed is an excellent test case for the
application of computer algebra systems, such as Maple, to scientiﬁc computation. A function A(s) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
s3 K A + sA [s2 K + 3 s K + 2 K] − A[s2 K + 4sK + 2K] = −s2 X , (1)
where K = s−1 − coth s and X = coth s − 1, subject to the boundary conditions
that A(s) is no more singular than s−2 at the origin and that A(s) decays at
inﬁnity. The equation has a regular singular point at s = 0 and an irregular point
at inﬁnity. In terms of this function, constants k1 and k2 must be calculated
according to the formulae

The challenge is to verify (by computation) that the two constants are equal.
The problem is an ideal one for exploring ways in which Maple can contribute to computational problems. Because of the singular points in the equation, the standard way to solve them numerically is to generate the ﬁrst steps of
a numerical solution using a series expansion about the origin, and about inﬁnity. The truncation of the series and the change from one integration method to
another generate some inaccuracies that might be acceptable in other contexts.
However, since the question concerns the diﬀerence between the constants at the
ﬁfth and sixth signiﬁcant ﬁgures, we need a highly accurate solution. Here we
show that such a solution can be obtained by Maple with relatively little eﬀort
on the part of the user, the work being done by routines that we developed in [2].
The use of series expansions in the solution of diﬀerential equations has always
been hampered by several diﬃculties. The ﬁrst diﬃculty is the laborious nature
of their derivation. This is compounded by the second diﬃculty, which is the slow
rate of convergence of the series. In order to obtain acceptable accuracy, many
terms are needed, but the calculation of these is tedious. The ﬁnal diﬃculty
is their radius of convergence. Often a singularity in the complex plane will
prevent the series converging at all points of interest, although the function is
well behaved on the real line.
All of these diﬃculties can be overcome in this case using Maple. The new
routines developed in [2] allow us to obtain large numbers of terms in the series
with little eﬀort and quickly. Using this fact we can re-expand the solution at
diﬀerent points along the axis, thus working around the convergence problem.
We shall thus obtain a highly accurate solution and prove that the two constants
k1 and k2 are indeed equal.

Solutions About s = 0

The diﬀerential equation (1) has a regular singular point at the origin and another in the complex plane at s = i π. We denote the homogeneous solutions

about s = 0 as Ah and the particular integral as Ap . Using Maple we found
each as a series expression correct to 75 terms.

We reject
the other homogeneous solution because asymptotically it behaves as

Series Solutions About Other Expansion Points

The solutions Ah and Ap converge only for s < π. This is unavoidable because

of the singularity on the imaginary axis. We expand the functions Ap and Ah
along the real axis by analytic or numerical continuation. We use the solutions

Ah and Ap to give us boundary conditions at a new expansion point. We
begin with the series solutions about s = 5/2, an ordinary point of the diﬀeren(5/2)
tial equation (1). We ﬁnd the homogeneous solution Ah
of the homogeneous
version of the diﬀerential equation (1) (i.e. right-hand side is zero) subject to

Continuing in this way, we ﬁnd the solutions at expansion points s = 4, 6, 8 etc.
To achieve high accuracy, all the solutions were found correct to 75 terms.

Asymptotic Solution

About s = ∞, we obtain an asymptotic expansion as follows.
For large s, coth(s) ∼ 1. We therefore replace coth s with 1 and ﬁnd the
particular integral ap and the homogeneous solution ah for the resulting equation
to be
ah = e−2s ,

ap = −2 s2 e−2s .

We neglect the other homogeneous solution which is 1 − 2 s for large s.
Higher order approximations are found in the same manner. Hence for large
s, the diﬀerential equation (1) has the asymptotic solution
A(s) ∼ ap + C ah

(12)

where the constant C has to be determined.

The Constants C and c

We ﬁnd the constants C and c by matching the two solutions, for s small and
for s large. The two solutions and their derivatives are equal for those values
of s where these solutions converge. By solving the two equations, we get the
constants c and C as given in Table (1).

Definite Integrals k1 and k2

Since we have series expansions at all points, the evaluation of the integral is
equally straightforward. The integrals k1 and k2 are found as
k1 = − 0.2622674637,
k2 = − 0.2622674637.
