Abstract. This paper proposes a low power real-time scheduling scheme
that minimizes power consumption and reassigns polling order on the
wireless sensor networks. The proposed scheme aims at enhancing the
power performance based on the maximum constant power method along
with the additional auxiliary schedule which can switch the primary one
when a speciﬁc channel falls in a bad state or time slot is unused. Built on
top of the EDF scheduling policy, the proposed scheme also tests whether
an unused slot can be reclaimed without violating the constraints of subsequent real-time streams. To improve the probability of reclaimed bandwidth, it also rearranges the polling order. The simulation results show
that the proposed scheme is able to enhance success ratio and it also
provides minimized power consumption.
Keywords: Real-time scheduling, low power scheme, EDF policy, reclaiming scheme, wireless sensor network.

Introduction

Battery-powered portable systems have been widely used in many applications,
such as mobile computing, wireless communications, information appliances,
wearable computing as well as various industrial and military applications.As
systems become more complex and incorporate more functionality, they become
more power-hungry[1]. Thus, reducing energy consumption and extending battery lifespan have become a critical aspect of designing battery-powered systems.
Low energy consumption is today an increasingly important design requirement
for digital systems, with impact on operating time, on system cost, and, of no
lesser importance, on the environment.
Reducing power and energy dissipation has long been addressed by several
research groups, at diﬀerent abstraction levels[2]. As a consequence, reduction
of the power consumption of processors, especially in OS (Operating System)
level, is important for the power-eﬃcient design of such systems. As a method

to reduce power consumption of processors in OS level, VSP (Variable Speed
Processor) can change its speed by varying the clock frequency along with the
supply voltage when the required performance on the processor is lower than
the maximum.
Wireless sensor networks use battery-operated computing and sensing
devices[3]. Sensor network nodes have very limited battery life; moreover once
deployed, a sensor network may be left unattended for its entire operational lifetime. This is due to the fact that sensor networks may be deployed in wide, remote, unaccessible areas.The energy-constrained nature of sensor networks calls
for protocols that have energy eﬃciency as a primary design goal. These characteristics of sensor networks and applications motivate a MAC (Medium Access
Control) in almost every way: energy conservation and self-conﬁguration are
primary goals, while per-node fairness and latency are less important.
EDF (Earliest Deadline First), which dynamically picks a message that has
the closest deadline among the pending ones, is known to be the most common
scheduling policy for real-time message streams[4]. WLAN can also exploit EDF
for message scheduling in various ways on the assumption that the communication pattern of sensory data is ﬁxed and known in priori. However, it is not clear
how well this algorithms will work for the wireless sensor networks, since wireless channels are subject to unpredictable location-dependent and bursty errors,
which make a real-time application fail to send or receive some of its real-time
packets[5]. Also, the design of energy-eﬃcient protocols has become an area of
intense research. This paper addresses these problems based on the maximum
constant power method along with the additional auxiliary schedule which can
switch the primary one when a speciﬁc channel falls in a bad state or time slot
is unused.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: After issuing the problem in Section 1, Section 2 introduces some related works, Section 3 explains background
and basic assumptions. Section 4 describes the proposed low power real-time
scheduling scheme in detail, and Section 5 shows the result of performance measurement. Finally, Section 6 summarizes and concludes this paper.

Related Works

This section introduces previous works regarding power-aware MAC protocols.
PAMAS (Power Aware Multi-Access Protocol with Signalling for Ad Hoc Networks) is one of the earliest contention-based protocols to address power eﬃciency in channel access[6]. It saves energy by attempting to avoid over-hearing
among neighboring nodes. To achieve this, PAMAS uses out-of channel signaling.
The IEEE 802.11 DCF is a contention-based protocol based on CSMA/CA
(Carrier Sensing Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance)[7]. IEEE 802.11 performs both physical and virtual carrier sensing. Virtual carrier sensing is achieved
by sending information about duration of each frame in the headers which is
used by stations as an indication of how long the channel will be busy. After
this time is elapsed, stations can sense the channel again. In order to solve the

“hidden terminal” problem and avoid data frame collisions, the RTS-CTS handshake is used. Two power management mechanisms are supported: active and
power-saving (PS).
The Sensor MAC protocol, or S-MAC, was developed with power savings as one
of its design goals[3]. It also falls into the contention-based protocol category but
achieves energy eﬃciency by making use of low-power radio mode. Nodes alternate
between periodic sleep and listen periods. Listen periods are split into synchronization and data periods. During synchronization periods, nodes broadcast their
sleeping schedule, and, based on the information received from neighbors, they
adjust their schedule so that they all sleep at the same time. During data periods,
a node with data to send will contend for the medium (RTS-CTS exchange). Unlike PAMAS, it only uses in-channel signaling. Finally, S-MAC applies message
passing to reduce contention latency for sensor-network applications.
T-MAC, a contention-based MAC protocol for wireless sensor network, is another notable example[8]. Applications for these networks have some characteristics that can be exploited to reduce energy consumption by introducing an
active/sleep duty cycle. To handle load variations in time and location T-MAC introduces an adaptive duty cycle by dynamically ending the active part of it. This
reduces the amount of energy wasted on idle listening, in which nodes wait for potentially incoming messages, while still maintaining a reasonable throughput.
TRAMA (TRaﬃc-Adaptive Medium Access) protocol is introduced for energyeﬃcient collision-free channel access in wireless sensor networks[9]. It reduces
energy consumption by ensuring that unicast, multicast, and broadcast transmissions have no collisions and by allowing nodes to switch to a low-power, idle state
whenever they are not transmitting or receiving. TRAMA assumes that time is
slotted and uses a distributed election scheme based on information about the trafﬁc at each node to determine which node can transmit at a particular time slot.

Background and Basic Assumptions
WLAN

WLAN divides its time axis into CFP (Contention Free Period) and CP (Contention Period), which are mapped into PCF (Point Coordination Function) and
DCF (Distributed Coordination Function), respectively. To provide the deterministic access to each node during CFP, AP (Access Point) polls each node
according to the predeﬁned order, and only the polled node can transmit its
frame. In the DCF interval, every node including AP contends the medium via
the CSMA/CA protocol. The AP periodically initiates CFP by broadcasting a
Beacon frame that has the precedence in transmission via shorter IFS (InterFrame Space).
Each station is associated with a channel which has either of two states,
namely, error state and error-free state at any time instant. A channel is deﬁned
between each mobile and the AP, and it can be modeled as a Gilbert channel[10].
We can denote the transition probability from state good to state bad by p

and the probability from state bad to state good by q. The pair of p and q
representing a range of channel conditions has been obtained by using the tracebased channel estimation. The average error probability and the average length
p
and 1q , respectively. A packet is received
of a burst of errors are derived as p+q
correctly if the channel remains in state good for the whole duration of packet
transmission. Otherwise, it is received in error. Channels between the AP and
respective stations are independent of one another in their error characteristics.

DVS Algorithms

DVS (Dynamic Voltage Scaling), which adjusts the supply voltage and clock
frequency dynamically, is an eﬀective low-power design technique for embedded
real-time systems[11]. Since the energy consumption E of CMOS circuits has a
quadratic dependency on the supply voltage, lowering the supply voltage is one
of the most eﬀective ways of reducing the energy consumption.

,
E ∝ CL · Ncycle · VDD

where E, CL , Ncycle and VDD are dynamic power consumption, load capacitance
of CMOS circuit, the number of executed cycle, and supply voltage, respectively.
For hard real-time systems, there are two types of voltage scheduling approaches depending on the voltage scaling granularity: intra-task DVS (IntraDVS)
and inter-task DVS (InterDVS) [2]. The intra-task DVS algorithms adjust the
voltage within an individual task boundary, while inter-task DVS algorithms
determine the voltage on a task-by-task basis at each scheduling point. Based on
inter-task DVS algorithms for periodic hard real-time systems, slack estimation
techniques are as follows[11] : Based on the periodicity and WCET (Worst Case
Execution Time) of tasks, we can estimate statically given slack times and exploit
those slack times to lower the clock speed, i.e., the worst case processor utilization
can be estimated and the clock speed can be adjusted based on that as in the
maximum constant speed heuristic. Since the arrival time of tasks are known a
priori, when a single task is active, its execution can be extended to the earliest
time of the next task with the lowered clock speed and voltage as in the stretching
to NTA (Next Task Arrival) technique[1].
While the above techniques exploit static information, other techniques utilize
dynamic information such as workload variation of tasks. The execution time of
each task is usually less than its WCET, and the actual processor utilization
during run time is usually lower than the worst case processor utilization.Thus,
when a task completes its execution much earlier than its WCET, the expected
utilization can be recalculated based on the actual execution time of completed
task, and the clock speed can be adjusted based on that as in utilization updating. Also, when a higher-priority task completes its execution earlier than
its WCET, the following lower-priority tasks can use the slack time, and the
clock speed can be lowered based on the slack time as in priority-based slack
stealing[12].

Proposed Scheduling Scheme
System Model

This paper exploits the contention-free TDMA style access policy as in [5], for
the real-time guarantee, as the contention resolution via packet collisions consumes the precious communication energy. As the real-time guarantee cannot
be provided without developing a deterministic access schedule, the network
time is divided into a series of equally sized slots to eliminate the unpredictability stemmed from access contention. Accordingly, the allocation scheme assigns
each slot to real-time streams so as to meet their time constraints. The slot
equals the basic unit of wireless data transmission and the other non-real-time
traﬃc is also segmented to ﬁt the slot size. Therefore, a preemption occurs only
at the slot boundary. This network access can be implemented by making AP
poll each station according to the predeﬁned schedule during the CFP.
The traﬃc of sensory data is typically isochronous (or synchronous), consisting
of message streams that are generated by their sources on a continuing basis and
delivered to their respective destinations also on a continuing basis[4]. This paper
follows the general real-time message model which has n streams, namely, S1 , S2 ,
..., Sn , and each Si generates a message less than WCET Ci at each beginning
of its period Pi . Each packet must be delivered to its destination within Di
time unit from its generation or arrival at the source, otherwise, the packet is
considered to be lost. Generally, Di coincides with Pi to make the transmission
complete before the generation of the next message. A task set is called feasible
if deadline of each task is satisﬁed at all times.
4.2

Scheduling Scheme

Assume all tasks are released simultaneously at time 0. A typical EDF schedule,
which assumes that tasks run at their WCETs (Ci ), is shown in Fig. 1.(a). The
IC of RF module can be manufactured by using CMOS technology. If the power
of the RF module is lowered by half or if the RF module with half performance
is used meaning that Ci is doubled, the EDF schedule becomes as shown in Fig.
1.(b). For example, if stream C were to take a little longer to complete, stream
A would miss its deadline at time 24. When some task instances are completed
earlier than their WCETs, there are more idle intervals as shown in Fig. 1.(c).
For dynamic-priority scheduling, a task set is feasible if and only if the utilization, U , is less than or equal to 1. Thus, power scaling factor, η, is straightCi
forward to compute because it is equal to the utilization, given by η =
Pi =

6 + 8 + 12 = 0.458. After all, the maximum constant power(V ) can be lowered
up to 0.458% and Fig. 1 shows the case whose maximum power is V2 . To reduce
the power consumption considering error characteristics, this paper proposes an
auxiliary schedule, X1t , as shown in Fig. 1.(b). After power scaling, the auxiliary
schedule helps the runtime scheduler to pick alternative stream according to the
auxiliary schedule as shown in Fig. 2.(a), when it cannot poll the stream in the
primary schedule. To build an auxiliary schedule, AP generates both arrival time

the result, the power consumption is reduced by minimizing the maximum power
and the time of continuous power-down(sleep) mode is increased by collecting
unused slots into one side.

Performance Measurement

This section measures the performance of the proposed scheduling scheme in
terms of the success ratio according to the packet error rate as well as the ratio
of BCET (Best Case Execution Time) to WCET using the event simulator. The
success ratio means the ratio of the number of successfully transmitted packets
within their deadlines to the total number of generated packets. Because the
statistics of the actual execution times of instances of the tasks are not available,
it is assumed that the execution time of each instance of a task is drawn from
a random Gaussian distribution. Then, the BCET is varied from 10% to 100%
of the WCET for each task. For the target stream sets, we ﬁxed the length
of a planning cycle to 24 as well as the number of streams to 3, and generated
every possible stream sets whose utilization ranges from 0.2 to 1.0. We measured
how many errors can be recovered and power-down mode can be allocated by
the auxiliary polling schedule, for the packet error rate of 0.0 through 0.5. In
MPEDF policy, a slack time of a task is estimated using the maximum constant
power and stretching-to-NTA methods[1].
Fig. 3 plots the measured result and compares the success ratio. As shown
in this ﬁgure, the performance gap gets larger with a higher packet error rate,
by up to 8.6 %. The proposedEDF scheme can widen the gap between those
curves, that is, considerably relieves the problem of error-prone WLAN and poor
utilization of PCF operation. Fig. 4 plots the power consumption ratio according
to the ratio of BCET/WCET. In the experiment, power consumption variable is
aligned to the non-power-down mode(EDF). It is certain that the improvement
gets larger as the error rate increases and BCET/WCET rate decreases. This
is due to the fact that the recovered portion gets larger and the probability of
power-down increases.

Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a low power real-time scheduling scheme that
minimizes power consumption and reassigns polling order on the wireless sensor
networks. The proposed scheme aims at enhancing the power performance based
on the maximum constant power method along with the additional auxiliary
schedule which can switch the primary one when a speciﬁc channel falls in a
bad state or time slot is unused. The simulation results show that the proposed
scheme is able to enhance success ratio and it also provides minimized power
consumption. Finally, we are to apply the power management scheme proposed
in this paper to the RM style polling framework combined with an error control
mechanism.
