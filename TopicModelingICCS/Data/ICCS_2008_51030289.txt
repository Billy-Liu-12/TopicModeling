1 Motivation
Computational Science techniques are increasingly being applied in both research
institutions and industry to for example, financial applications, bioinformatics applications, physical applications, data mining applications based on grid or clusters etc.
As with other disciplines there are specific issues when planning and developing such
applications. For example, those applications are generally distributed and based upon
Grid environments or clusters with specific management and planning issues, design,
testing, etc.
This workshop was created with the intention of analysing software engineering issues specific to these types of applications such as adaptation of processes for, planning, management, verification and validation, testing, quality measurement, etc.
Also, there is also a motivation for further research on the other direction, i.e., the
application of computational intelligence techniques to software engineering issues as
a result of the creation of large metrics databases collected from software projects.
Examples of computational techniques applied to Software Engineering include genetic algorithms, Bayesian networks, system dynamics, visualization, search based
software engineering etc. Many emergent issues are subject to research efforts combining both computational techniques and Software Engineering.

2 Topics of Interest and Objectives
Therefore, topics of interest of this workshop included:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Software processes for computational science applications

D. Rodríguez and R. Ruiz

And the objectives included:
•
•
•
•

To bring together researchers and practitioners from computational science
and software engineers backgrounds
To steer discussion and debate on various aspects and issues related to software engineering processes when applied to computational problems
How to apply software engineering techniques to computational intelligence
problems
To open research directions that are deemed essential by the researchers in
the field and industry

The 9 selected papers out of the 19 submitted cover these topics from both points
of view, i.e., software engineering issues for large scale applications and using computational science for helping with software engineering issues.
