Abstract
This work presents a high order numerical method for the solution of generalized Black-Scholes
model for European call option. The numerical method is derived using a two-step backward
diﬀerentiation formula in the temporal discretization and a High-Order Diﬀerence approximation with Identity Expansion (HODIE) scheme in the spatial discretization. The present scheme
gives second order accuracy in time and third order accuracy in space. Numerical experiments
are conducted in support of the theoretical results.
Keywords: Generalized Black-Scholes model, Two-step backward diﬀerentiation formula, HODIE

Introduction

Option pricing is a well ﬂourished subject in the ﬁnancial market. Options are the tools against
the uncertainty of the market. The writer of an option gives its holder right to hedge the risk
by limiting the loss, for which the writer is paid a premium called the option price ([29, 2]).
Let there be a frictionless and arbitrage free ﬁnancial market comprised of a risk-free asset
and a unit risky asset. The following stochastic diﬀerential equation
dS = (μ − D)Sdτ + σSdW,

(1)

gives a mathematical representation for the asset price S of the unit risky asset. Here μ is
the drift rate, D is the dividend yield, σ is the market volatility and dW is the increment of
a standard Wiener process. The following famous Black-Scholes equation for evaluating the
option price C(S, τ ), is derived applying Itˆo’s lemma and through elimination of randomness
in a complete market

along with the ﬁnal condition
C(S, T ) = max(S − K, 0),

S ∈ [0, ∞),

(3)

where τ is the time variable, r is the risk free interest rate, T is the expiry time of the contract
and K is the strike price. It was derived by Fischer Black and Myron Scholes in their seminal
work [1].
When σ, r and D are constants, the Black-Scholes equation can be easily transformed into
standard heat equation, and the following analytical formula is obtained for pricing the option
([1, 30, 21]).
C(S, τ ) = S exp(−D(T − τ ))N (d1 ) − K exp(−r(T − τ ))N (d2 ),

But in the ﬁnancial market the parameters σ, r and D can be dependent on the asset price
S and the time variable τ . Analytical solution of such generalized Black-Scholes model is not
known.
The generalized Black-Scholes model was numerically solved in [14, 22, 25, 28, 13, 11, 4,
3]. Cubic B-spline collocation method was used in [14, 13] to get a second order scheme for
approximating generalized Black-Scholes model. In [11], cubic polynomial spline method and
implicit Euler method was used in space and time respectively to solve the model, achieving
second order accuracy in space. Cubic B-spline collocation method and Crank-Nicolsion timestepping scheme was used in space and time direction respectively in [14] and [13] to get
second order accuracy in both space and time for the generalized model. In the work [22], the
author achieved third order accuracy in space using the quintic B-spline collocation method
and ﬁrst and second order accuracy in time using backward Euler method and Crank-Nicolson
method respectively. A novel ﬁtted ﬁnite volume method along with an implicit time stepping
technique was used in [28] and an O(h) accuracy was achieved. In the work [25], a ﬁtted
ﬁnite volume method was applied to the generalized model with O(h2 ) order of convergence.
In [4], the authors have achieved second order accuracy using an exponential time integration
scheme along with a central diﬀerence scheme for spatial discretization. A method based on
central diﬀerence spatial discretization and implicit time stepping technique was applied in
[3] to achieve O(k + h2 ) accuracy. Lattice approach was also applied for option pricing, such
as binomial formula, also called CRR model was developed in [8], a trinomial process was
introduced in [23] and such lattice approach was further generalized in [12].
In the present paper we construct a high order numerical scheme for approximating the
option price governed by the generalized Black-Scholes model for European call option. We have
applied two-step backward diﬀerentiation formula in temporal discretization to achieve second
order convergence in time direction and the classical High-Order Diﬀerence approximation
with Identity Expansion (HODIE) scheme where three nodal auxiliary points are used for
identity expansion to achieve third convergence in spatial direction. We have done simultaneous
discretization in time and space directions and hence established the convergence of the scheme
1766

with simpler arguments ([7]). This yields a ﬁnite diﬀerence scheme which has second order
convergence in time and third order convergence in space.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the generalized BlackScholes model. Smoothing of the terminal condition, some transformations and the truncation
of the inﬁnite domain for numerical purpose are given. In Section 3, simultaneous discretization
of the parabolic partial diﬀerential equation along with initial and boundary conditions is done
and the numerical scheme is derived. In Section 4, convergence analysis of the numerical scheme
is done. Numerical experiments are given in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes the paper.

and boundary conditions
C(0, τ ) = 0,
C(S, τ ) → S,

(5c)

as S → ∞.

(5d)

Here σ, r and D are assumed to be continuous and bounded functions.
The terminal condition of the above problem is not smooth. Hence to ensure the convergence of the numerical solution ([10, 24]), we replace a small -neighbourhood of the point of
singularity by a eleventh degree polynomial φ(S) so that the payoﬀ is a ﬁfth order smooth function ([3]). For getting higher order accurate numerical scheme, we apply the transformations
S = exp(x) and τ = T − t, where x and t are the new space and time variables respectively, to
change our degenerate ﬁnal boundary value problem (5) into a non-degenerate initial boundary
value problem. We will give new notation to all the variables, for example any variable say
ˆ
X(S, τ ) is now X(x,
t).
To apply the numerical scheme, we truncate the inﬁnite space domain (−∞, ∞) and take
the domain [xmin , xmax ], where xmin and xmax and the boundary conditions at left and right
boundaries are chosen suitably ([27, 15]). The existence and uniqueness of the problem considered and of its various intermediate forms during the stated modiﬁcations are well established
([9, 5, 18]).
Deﬁne the domain Ω = (xmin , xmax ) × (0, T ]. After the stated modiﬁcations, we have the
following initial boundary value problem which we will solve numerically

three auxiliary points xm−1 , xm , xm+1 . The HODIE coeﬃcients α s and β s, are computed

Conclusion

In the present work we have developed a high order numerical scheme for pricing European
call option governed by generalized Black-Scholes model. The scheme is constructed in the way
that we can simultaneously discretize in space and time directions ([17]) which leads to simpler
convergence analysis as also explained in [7]. Two step backward diﬀerentiation formula is used
for temporal discretization and HODIE scheme with three nodal and symmetric auxiliary points
is used for spacial discretization. Theoretically we have achieved O(k 2 + h3 ) accuracy. But the
numerical experiments show fourth order convergence in space which leads us to consider further
improvement in the theoretical result.
