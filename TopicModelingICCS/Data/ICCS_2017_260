ICCS 2017 in Zürich, Switzerland, will be the seventeenth in this series of highly successful
conferences. For the previous sixteen meetings see: http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2017/previousiccs/
The theme for ICCS 2017 is "The Art of Computational Science. Bridging Gaps – Forming
Alloys", to highlight the role of computation as a fundamental method of scientific inquiry and
technological discovery tackling problems across scientific domains and creating synergies between
disciplines. This conference will be a unique event focusing on recent developments in: scalable
scientific algorithms; advanced software tools; computational grids; advanced numerical methods; and
novel application areas. These innovative novel models, algorithms and tools drive new science
through efficient application in areas such as physical systems, computational and systems biology,
environmental systems, finance, and others.
ICCS is well known for its excellent line up of keynote speakers. The keynotes for 2017 are:

Anastasia Ailamaki, École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, Switzerland
Efthimios Kaxiras, Harvard University, USA
Michael Norman, San Diego Supercomputer Center, UC San Diego, USA
Tomaso Poggio, Eugene McDermott Professor, MIT, USA
Olga Sorkine-Hornung, ETH Zürich, Switzerland
Rick L. Stevens, Argonne National Laboratory, USA
Stefan Thurner, Medical University of Vienna, Austria

This year we had 625 submissions (267 submissions to the main track and 358 to the workshops).
In the main track, 74 full papers were accepted (28%). In the workshops, 151 full papers (42%). A
high acceptance rate in the workshops is explained by the nature of these thematic sessions, where
many experts in a particular field are personally invited by workshop organisers to participate in their
sessions.
ICCS relies strongly on the vital contributions of our workshop organizers to attract high quality
papers in many subject areas. We would like to thank all committee members for the main track and
workshops for their contribution to ensure a high standard for the accepted papers. We would also like
to thank Elsevier and Intellegibilis for their support.
We are proud to note that ICCS is an ERA 2010 A-ranked conference series.
We wish you a successful and enjoyable conference in Zürich.
