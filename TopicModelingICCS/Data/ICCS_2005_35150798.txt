Abstract. This paper discusses an implementation of an adaptive resolution system for modeling regional air pollution based on the chemical
transport model STEM. The grid adaptivity is implemented using the
generic tool Paramesh. The computational algorithm uses a decomposition of the domain, with the solution in diﬀerent sub-domains computed
at diﬀerent spatial resolutions. We analyze the parallel computational
performance versus the accuracy of long time simulations.
Keywords: Air Pollution Modeling, Adaptive Mesh Reﬁnement.

Introduction

Inadequate grid resolution can be an important source of errors in air pollution
modeling (APM) where large spatial gradients of tracer concentrations result
from the complex interactions between emissions, meteorological conditions, and
nonlinear atmospheric chemistry [9].
Chock et. al. [3] studied the eﬀects of grid resolution on model predictions
of non-homogeneous atmospheric chemistry. They concluded that increasing the
grid size leads to a reduction of the suppression of ozone (O3 ) in the presence of
high nitrogen oxides (N OX = N O + N O2 ), and a decrease in the strength of the
N OX inhibition eﬀect. O3 loses nearly all the detail near the emission source in
the coarse grid case.
A popular multi-resolution approach in air pollution and meteorological modeling is static nesting of ﬁner grids into coarser grids. This approach requires
apriori knowledge of where to place the high resolution grids inside the modeling domain; but it does not adjust to dynamic changes in the solution during
simulation. In many practical situations the modeler “knows” where higher resolution is needed, e.g. above industrial areas.
In this paper we investigate the parallel performance and accuracy improvements for an application of adaptive mesh reﬁnement (AMR) for modeling regional air pollution. The grid adapts dynamically during the simulation, with the
purpose of controlling the numerical spatial discretization error. Unlike uniform
reﬁnement, adaptive reﬁnement is more economical. Unlike static grid nesting,

with AMR it is not necessary to specify in advance which areas need higher resolution; what is required is to deﬁne a reﬁnement criterion, which is then used
by the code to automatically adjust the grid.
The use of generic AMR tools (Paramesh [6, 7]) allows us to harness the
power of parallel computers for regional air pollution simulations. Parallel computing is needed as the higher the resolution, the more expensive the simulation
becomes.
The paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 gives an overview of previous work.
A brief description of the static mesh APM application and of the AMR system
used in this paper is given in Sec. 3. The reﬁnement criterion used in this paper
is described in detail in Sec. 3.1. Numerical results are shown in Sec. 4, and Sec.
5 presents conclusions and future research directions.

Previous Work

Adaptive meshes have been used in the study of pollutant dispersion in atmosphere [10, 9, 5]. In this section we will discuss some atmospheric AMR applications.
The Ph.D. dissertation of van Loon [10] is focused on numerical methods for
smog prediction. The model developed, CWIROS, has 4 vertical layers and its
horizontal domain covers all Europe. The horizontal resolution is 60 × 60 Km,
with 4 levels of reﬁnement. The spatial error estimator uses the curvature of
the concentration ﬁelds. Speciﬁcally, for each column the horizontal curvature is
estimated for each species and normalized. The column is ﬂagged for reﬁnement
if the error estimator is larger than a user-prescribed tolerance.
Srivastava, McRae and Odman [9] discuss a very interesting approach to
grid adaptivity (DSAGA-PPM) for simulating reactive atmospheric pollutants.
DSAGA-PPM uses horizontal (2D) adaptivity and employs a constant number of
grid nodes. This keeps the total computational time for a simulation manageable.
A weight function is deﬁned by a linear combination of curvatures of diﬀerent
chemical species. Based on this weight function the grid is adapted.

Implementation Considerations

In this section we describe the numerical and software components of our application. First, we discuss the science application and next we brieﬂy present the
AMR approach.
The core science application used in this paper is the state–of–the–art regional
APM, STEM [2]. The original code uses a ﬁxed grid, with all the data structures
being multidimensional arrays.
STEM solves the advection-diﬀusion-reaction equation for N species on a
3-D domain:
∂
ci + ∇ · (uci ) = ∇ · (D∇ci ) + f (ci ), with i = 1 . . . N.
∂t

The equation is solved using an operator splitting approach. STEM uses linear
ﬁnite diﬀerence discretizations of the transport terms and Rosenbrock methods
for solving stiﬀ chemistry [8].
Paramesh oﬀers the infrastructure for AMR on a 2D structured grid.Paramesh
is a parallel AMR Fortran toolkit developed by P. MacNeice and K. Olson at the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center [6, 7]. The adaptive resolution is based on a
Schwarz-type domain decomposition, with a single Schwarz iteration. We use a
two-dimensional (horizontal) grid reﬁnement approach. All the data associated
with a column in the original STEM (referred to as STEM variables) are assigned
to a mesh-point (cell) in Paramesh, including geographical and meteorological
data and species concentrations along the z axis.
The domain is divided into blocks, each containing 6 × 6 cells plus two guardcells along each block boundary [1]. At the coarse level, each cell has a resolution
of 80 × 80 Km. For the TraceP (described in Sec. 4.1) simulation over East Asia,
the computational domain is covered by 15 × 10 blocks. At the ﬁnest level (level
4) each cell has a resolution of 10×10 Km. Data are linearly interpolated between
reﬁnement levels during each mesh reﬁnement/dereﬁnement operation.
During the simulation data available in STEM-speciﬁc data types need to
be copied into Paramesh data types. The initial species concentrations and geographical information are provided at coarse level at the beginning of the simulation. Meteorological ﬁelds, boundary conditions and surface emissions are updated every hour. All data are given at the coarse level, except for the emission
inventories which are provided at a ﬁne resolution (10 × 10 Km).
Experimentally, we noticed a loss in accuracy associated with block reﬁnement near the physical boundary due to the fact that boundary data are available
at coarse level only. A reﬁnement restriction was applied to blocks neighboring
the domain boundary, such that they are maintained at coarse levels.
The regriding process is handled by Paramesh. Each time the regriding is
performed, blocks on each processor are reﬁned or dereﬁned according to one of
our criteria and then migrated to other processors if necessary with the goals of
load balancing and data locality.

Refinement Criteria

The estimation of the spatial error in a N XB×N Y B = N 2 cells horizontal block
(at vertical level k) is done based on the horizontal curvature of the concentration
ﬁeld c at each point (i, j, k) in space

+ |ci,j+1,k − 2ci,j,k + ci,j−1,k | ,

Note that the error is ignored if the concentration inside the block is below a userprescribedlevel,Atol.Thetotalerrorestimateinacolumnistakentobethemaximum
error among all layers ERR(c) = maxk ERRk (c) . The block is ﬂagged for reﬁnement if ERR(c) ≥ uptol and for dereﬁnement if ERR(c) ≤ lowtol.
The model calculates the concentrations of a large number of trace species and
the reﬁnement pattern depends on which concentrations are used for error estimation. We consider a multiple species criterion, focusing on O3 , formaldehyde
(HCHO) and N OX compounds – the main precursors of O3 . A weighted combination of the regarded species is considered:w1 N O+w2 N O2 +w3 O3 +w4 HCHO,
with w1,2 = 35% and w3,4 = 15%. The error for a mesh-point, based on species

The grid is reﬁned in the areas of high emissions, i.e. above industrial regions in
China, Japan and Korea. The reﬁnement criteria is applied at simulated hourly
increments. In our experiments, we regrid every three hours.

Results

In this section we analyze the performance of the parallel implementation for
work load and accuracy. Sec. 4.1, describes the experimental setting and Sec. 4.2
discusses the results.
4.1

Experimental Setting

The test problem is a real-life simulation of air pollution in East Asia in support
of the TraceP [4] ﬁeld experiment. The TraceP (NASA TRAnsport and Chemical
Evolution over the Paciﬁc) ﬁeld experiment was conducted in East Asia. The
meteorological ﬁelds, boundary values and emission rates correspond to TraceP
starting at 0 GMT of March 4th , 2001 for one week of simulation time. Due
to the fact that our initial data are not smooth enough, an imminent transient
phase tends to occur if one should start reﬁning from the coarse level. Instead, we
simulated two days, starting with March 1st , 2001, at the ﬁnest level and after
that we applied the mesh reﬁnement criterion and allowed the grid to coarsen.
The accuracy and timing results were taken into consideration after three days
of simulation (two at the ﬁnest level and one for system adjusting to a relative
steady state).
The simulated region covers 7200 × 4800 Km. At the coarse level (each cell
with 80 × 80 Km) there are 150 blocks, each containing 6 × 6 cells. At the ﬁnest
level, level 4 (10 × 10 Km) there are 5058 working blocks (182,088 mesh points).
Each cell holds a column of 18 layers with 2340 of STEM variables.

The simulations are performed on Virginia Tech’s System X, the fastest academic supercomputer in the world. It has 1100 node Apple XServe G5 dual processor, 4 Gb of RAM per node. The interconnect consists of InﬁniBand switches
(primary) and Cisco 4506 Gigabit Ethernet (secondary). We were unable to accurately measure execution times for long simulations but we were able to make
an estimation of the scalability based on short one simulated hour runs.
4.2

Numerical/Parallel Performance

The timing results for 1 simulated hour at the ﬁnest reﬁnement level on 16,
32, 64 and 96 processors are presented in table 1.a. Considering the fact that
the workload remains constant, the speed-up is relatively good especially when
using 1 processor per node. The computational intensive part of our application
shows an insigniﬁcant improvement when we switch from one to two processors
per node. On the other hand, the communication intensive portion shows a large
improvement when switching from two to one processors per node. The reason
for that is probably a less congested communication pattern.
Table 1.b shows the wall-clock for several scenarios (Fine, Coarse and two
AMR runs) for one week of simulation. The application tuning for speciﬁc processor workload is a problem in itself, especially for parallel implementations,
due to the diﬃculty in managing the amount of reﬁnement that each processor
does. Scenario AMR 1 is close to a quarter of the total ﬁne wall-clock and close
to our expectations in terms of accuracy as it will be shown below. AMR-2 is
very competitive in terms of timing but the accuracy of the simulation is degraded (see Figs. 1.a and 2.a). In our experiments we noticed that accuracy is
tightly linked to the number of mesh-points that are concentrated in the higher
estimated truncation error locations.
The accuracy results are computed as the error mean for all 18 layers represented as error level contours. The error levels for O3 after one week of simulation are shown in Figure 1.{a,b,c} for the two AMR results compared to the
coarse simulation. The same results are also shown for the N O species in Figure 2.{a,b,c}. AMR-1 has a very high accuracy performance for both species,
while AMR-2 has not performed so well. This suggests that insuﬃcient reﬁnement does not bring any signiﬁcant gains in terms of accuracy. The mesh-point

maximum reﬁnement level 4 (10 × 10 Km)

dynamics over the one week period is shown in Figure 2.d. As we have expected,
the system ﬁnds itself in a relative steady state - ﬁne grids may move but the
overall number of mesh-points is kept relatively constant, decreasing slowly as
the solution becomes more and more smooth.

Conclusions

In this paper we investigate the parallel performance and accuracy improvements
of an adaptive grid air pollution model based on the parallelized STEM air
pollution model with the Paramesh tool. We look for accuracy improvements in
O3 and N OX , species and low computational overheads.
The model scales very well as long as we use one processor per node. The communication intensive part plays a very important role as we tested our application

(d) – Represents the evolution of the number of blocks over the simulated week

on a network of workstations. This may be alleviated by a better mesh-point to
processor partitioning.
The workload corresponding to the number of mesh-points is determined by
the reﬁnement criterion’s reﬁnement and dereﬁnement thresholds. We found it
very diﬃcult to ﬁnd appropriate values for those tolerances due to the relative autonomy of each process. A possible mitigation for this problem would
be to collect all the mesh-point truncation errors, rank them and allow reﬁnement/dereﬁnement to a limited number of blocks. We chose to let the system
evolve without any restrictions.
The accuracy beneﬁts of AMR are ampliﬁed by the use of large number meshpoints: the ﬁner the mesh, the better the accuracy. In our experiments, the use
of almost triple the number of mesh-points than for the coarse simulation did
not bring signiﬁcant accuracy improvements to the ﬁnal solution, while keeping
the number of mesh-points between one quarter and one third of the ﬁne one
showed just a little solution degradation.

The dominant errors are located downwind of the emission sources especially
for the high resolution AMR simulations (large number of mesh-points). A possible explanation is that the eﬀect of errors in regions with high emissions are
ampliﬁed by the chemical processes and advected downwind. This aspect would
suggest a reﬁned grid (increased resolution) upwind of the area of interest.
