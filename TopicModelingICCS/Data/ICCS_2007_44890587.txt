Abstract. Personalized service is becoming increasingly important, especially in
E-learning field. Most personalized E-learning systems only take learners
preferences, interests and browsing behaviors into consideration. These systems
usually neglect considering whether the learners ability and the difficulty level of
recommended learning materials are matched to each other or not. This paper
proposes a personalized E-learning system using fuzzy set based clustering
algorithm which considers both course materials’ difficulty and learners’ ability
to provide appropriate learning stuffs for learners individually, to help learners
learn more efficiently and effectively.
Keywords: Difficulty level; Learner ability; Fuzzy clustering algorithm.

1 Introduction
As the Internet gains wide popularity around the world, high diversity of the learners on
the Internet brings new challenges to the traditional “one-size-fit-all” learning model [1].
So it’s of great importance to provide a personalized system which can automatically
adapt to the interests and levels of learners’ ability.
Cluster analysis is a technique to divide the data set in such a way that cases assigned
to the same cluster should be as similar as possible whereas two objects from different
clusters should be as dissimilar as possible[2]. In the proposed system, we strive to
model learners’ ability to group similar learners into homogeneous classes, and the
fuzzy clustering algorithm is a good choice which we adopt.

2 Personalized E-Learning System
2.1 System Architecture
In the proposed personalized E-learning system, there are five layers. Database layer
consists of user account, course and user profile databases. The user account database
records the basic information. The user profile database contains learners’ trajectory.
The course database contains the course materials and their corresponding difficulty

levels. Users’ feedback acquisition layer consists of questionnaire, quiz and behavior
record. Through the questionnaire and quiz after each material, system can collect the
main information of the learners’ ability and the materials’ difficulty level. Through the
record of the learners’ behavior, it can provide the system with the proof of the
feedback and the information of the learners’ ability and preferences. Data mining and
inference layer is to extract and infer the materials’ difficulty level and the learners’
ability from the data of database layer. Recommend and push layer uses the learners’
new abilities to select appropriate course materials for learners individually.
Presentation layer provides a register, login, searching and browsing interface to let the
users become registered ones, help learners retrieve specified course materials.
2.2 The Key Techniques and Algorithms
2.2.1 Calculate Difficulty Parameters of Course Materials Dynamically
The course materials’ difficulty level is classified into five points: {very hard, hard,
moderate, easy, and very easy}, depicted as Dif1, Dif2, Dif3, Dif4, Dif5 [3]. Dexp denotes
the experts’ decision of material difficulty level, which can be calculated in formula (1).

Where Cn denotes the number of experts that select the difficulty level of Difn, Cexperts

The materials difficulty parameters assessed by the learners and teachers can be
calculated by formula (2), marked as Dstu and Dtea respectively.

Where Cm/Cj denotes the number of learners/teachers that select the difficulty level of
Difm/Difj, Clearners/Cteachers denotes the number of learners/teachers who have already
studied/used the course material.
The adjusted difficulty parameter of a certain material is calculated by formula (3):
D = w1 × Dexp + w2 × Dtea + (1 − w1 − w2 ) × D stu .

Where w1 and w2(0<1-w1-w2<w2<w1 <1) denote the weight of the course difficulty
parameters the experts recommend and the teacher users decide respectively.
2.2.2 Estimate the Level of Learner Abilities
In E-learning systems, there are many variables that determine the learners’ ability.
Herein, we just consider the most important ones. We form a factor set for the system,
which is depicted as: U={u1,u2,u3,u4,u5}, in which u1 denotes the time spent on each
material, u2 denotes questionnaire feedback after each material, u3 denotes quiz
feedback after each material, u4 denotes times clicking on antecedent material links, u5
denotes random mouse move and click. The weight set can be depicted as:
W={w1,w2,w3,w4,w5}, which we adopts the value as W={0.2, 0.35, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05}.

u1: the time spent on each material, with the weight w1.
The assessment set of u1 is depicted as V1= {very long, long, moderate, short, very
short}, the corresponding weight set is depicted as A={a1,a2,a3,a4,a5}. Ti represents a
learner’s browsing time on a certain material. We compute the learners’ average
browsing time on a certain material [4], depicted as formula (4).

Where n represents the total number of learners that has browsed the certain material.
Notably, the Tis which are too big and too small are excluded.
Then we can use statistic method to calculate the ratio of each assessment element in
assessment set V1 for a certain material. We defined the time range as formula (5):

Trange = (1 + b) × T , ( b =

T −T
)

The variable b denotes the bias of the time period. The membership degree of
different time range corresponding to V1 is defined as formula (6):

are acquired through experiment. The other weight calculation method resembles a1’s,
where the value b is differentiated every time.

The assessment set of u2 is depicted as V2={completely understand, understand,
moderate, little of understanding, completely not understand}, and its corresponding
weight set is depicted as B={b1,b2,b3,b4,b5}. We use the statistic method to calculate the
ratio of each assessment element in assessment set V2 for a certain material.

u3: quiz feedback after each material, with the weight w3.
The assessment set of u3 is described as V3={very good, good, moderate, bad, very
bad}, and its corresponding weight set is depicted as C={c1,c2,c3,c4,c5}. The calculation
method of the weight set of C resembles the B’s fore mentioned.

The assessment set of u3 is described as V4={very many, many, moderate, few, very
few}, and its corresponding weight set is depicted as D={d1,d2,d3,d4,d5}. The
calculation method of the weight set of D resembles the one of B fore mentioned.

The assessment set of u3 is described as V5={very many, many, moderate, few, very
few}, with its weight set E={e1,e2,e3,e4,e5}. The calculation method of E resembles the
ones of u1 and u4. Herein, we don’t mention any more about the algorithm.
Now, we can calculate the learners’ abilities. Just take one group of data for
example. The factor weight set W={0.2, 0.35, 0.3, 0.1, 0.05}, assume that we have the
result data of a learner X, whose vector set is calculated already, his/her vector set result
is vx=(0.9,0.5,0.8,0.8,0.8). The learner X’s ability is calculated as formula (7):
X ability =W × vx =0.715 .

(7)

～

Before we rank the learner X’s ability level, we have to classify the number 0 1 into
five points: {Very high ability, high ability, moderate ability, low ability, very low
ability}. Herein, X’s ability result is 0.715, is between the {high ability} thresholds
from the system inference.
After reevaluates learners’ abilities and recalculates the course materials difficulty
levels, the system can recommend materials to learners based on learners’ ability.

3 Conclusion
The system provides personalized learning according to course materials visited by
learners and their responses, the experiment results show that the proposed system
precisely provides personalized course material recommendations based on learners
ability, and moreover accelerate learners’ learning efficiency and effectiveness.
