Abstract. In the case of strongly coupled problems like ﬂuid-structure
models in aero-elasticity or aero-thermo-mechanics, a standard solution
methodology is based on so called Dirichlet-Neumann iterations. This
means that, for instance, the velocity at the interface between the two
media is imposed in the ﬂuid, the solution of the ﬂuid problem gives
a pressure that is imposed at the boundary of the structure, and then
the solution of the problem in the structure gives a new velocity to be
imposed to the ﬂuid. This method is not always stable, depending on the
relative properties of the media, unless a suitable relaxation parameter is
introduced. In order to enforce both velocity and pressure continuity at
the interface, the matching conditions can be formulated, like in domain
decomposition methods, in a mixed form. This means that the boundary
conditions derived in one physical domain from the other one is of Robin
type. With Robin boundary condition, an interface stiﬀness, in the case
of velocity-pressure conditions, is introduced. The optimal choice for this
stiﬀness can be proved to be, in the case of linear problems, the so called
”Dirichlet-Neumann” operator of the opposite domain, this means for
the discrete equations, the static condensation on the interface of the
domain stiﬀness matrix. Of course, the static condensation cannot be
performed in practice, since it is extremely expensive and that the resulting matrix is dense. But it can be approximated in several ways.
The underlying general idea behind that methodology is the following:
with Robin boundary conditions on the interface, a constitutive law is
imposed on the boundary of each media that should optimally exactly
represent the interaction with the other media.

Introduction

Fluid-structure interaction for aero-elasticity of airplanes or for aero-thermomechanics of aeronautical engines involve strong coupling. That means that not
only primal quantities, like temperature or velocities, must be continuous, but

also dual quantities, like heat ﬂux or pressure, must be balanced. The solution
context then is mathematically similar to the one of domain decomposition for
a single equation.
A very standard methodology for solving strongly coupled problem relies on alternate iterations on the various quantities at the interface between the domains
until stagnation. When stagnation occurs, interface continuity requirements are
fulﬁlled.
In the context of domain decomposition method, this methodology is called,
for second order PDEs like steady heat equation or linear elasticity, DirichletNeumann iteration [1]. In the second section of this paper standard convergence
results for this method will be recalled. In the third section, Robin interface
conditions will be introduced and will be proved to give a better stability to the
method. General methodological approaches to design optimal Robin interface
conditions will be mentioned in the concluding section.

Dirichlet-Neumann Iterations
Model Problem

For a sake of simplicity, we consider the steady heat transfer problem with two
domains Ω1 and Ω2 . Note Γ3 = ∂Ω1 ∂Ω2 , the interface between both domains,
like in Fig. 1. Inside each domain, the steady heat equation must be solved.

The principle of Dirichlet-Neumann method is as follows. Solve the problem in
Ω1 , with prescribed values of u1 on interface (Dirichlet problem). Compute the

ﬂux k1 ∂n

Γ3 (Neumann problem). Take the trace on interface of the solution of Neumann
problem in Ω2 and impose it as Dirichlet boundary condition in Ω1 , u1 = u2 on
Γ3 . Restart iteration until stagnation.
This simple iterative process consists in enforcing alternatively the continuity
of temperature and the equilibrium of ﬂux at interface. It is clear that if the
process converges it gives local solutions that satisfy both interface conditions
of equations (3) and (4). Hence, the converged local solution ﬁelds satisfy the
global coupled problem.
2.2

Discretization

Consider a discretization of equation (1) using ﬁnite element method. Each subdomain has its own mesh and the interface nodes are present in both meshes as
in Fig. 2. Local stiﬀness matrices of the discrete problems in the two domains

can be written like in equation (5), using subscripts 1 and 2 for inner degrees of
freedom of domains Ω1 and Ω2 and subscript 3 for degrees of freedom of interface Γ3 . Interface Γ3 is present in both meshes. Hence, there are two interface
blocks, one in each local matrix, noted with superscripts (1) and (2).

For vectors that satisfy inner equation of (6), there is an explicit relationship
between the inner values and the interface values:

xi = Kii−1 bi − Kii−1 Ki3 x3

(i)

(7)

From explicit relation between inner and interface values in equation (7) and
thanks to the representation of discrete ﬂux in equation (6), the standard following relation linking the trace and the ﬂux of a vector satisfying inner equation
can be derived:
(i)

(i) (i)

(i)
(i) (i)
= S x3 − c3

(8)

Matrix S (i) = K33 − K3i Kii−1 Ki3 is the Schur complement matrix. It is the
discretization of the so called Dirichlet to Neumann mapping that deﬁnes the
bi-continuous one to one correspondence between the trace and the ﬂux on the
boundary of a ﬁeld that satisﬁes the steady heat equation inside the domain.
It is symmetric positive deﬁnite if the Ki matrix is symmetric positive deﬁnite.
The same holds, of course, for any other second order coercive PDE.
For the Dirichlet problem in domain Ω1 , only test functions with null trace on
Γ3 have to be considered, so the discrete form of this problem is, for a prescribed
trace x3 on interface:
(1)
K11 x1 + K13 x3 = b1
(9)
(1)
x3 = x3
(i)

The discrete ﬂux associated with the solution of equation (9) can be recovered
from equation (6), as already done to deﬁne Schur complement in equation (8):

g3 = K31 x1 + K33 x3 − b3

(13)

If local solution vectors satisfy the continuity condition (12), then, thanks to
(1)
(2)
equations (9) and (11), the global vector x, with x3 = x3 = x3 satisfy inner
equations in domains Ω1 and Ω2 :
K11 x1 + K13 x3 = b1
K22 x2 + K23 x3 = b2

(14)

Equilibrium condition (13), combined with local equations (10) and (11), gives
the following interface equation:

K31 x1 + K33 x3 − b3 = −(K32 x2 + K33 x3 − b3 ) ⇔
(1)
(2)
(1)
(2)
K31 x1 + K32 x2 + (K33 + K33 )x3 = b3 + b3

(15)

Inner equations (14) and interface equation (15) mean that local solution vectors
satisfying both the continuity condition (12) and the equilibrium condition (13)
deﬁne a global vector solution of the assembled global problem:
⎡

⎤⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤

where K33 = K33 + K33 and b3 = b3 + b3 .
Of course, equation (16) is the standard discretization of the global coupled
problem, that is, in the present case, the steady heat equation on the complete
domain.
Performing elimination of inner unknowns as already done to deﬁne Schur
complement in equation (8) in the global coupled system (16) leads to a coupled
condensed problem on Γ3 :

Discrete Dirichlet-Neumann Iteration

Iteration p of Dirichlet-Neumann iteration consists in the following steps.
1. Given xp3 , solve the Dirichlet problem in domain Ω1 :
(1)p

K11 xp1 + K13 x3
(1)p
x3 = xp3

= b1

(20)

2. Compute interface ﬂux:

4. Derive new value of interface trace:

(23)

In reality, only interface values matter in the iteration, since inner values of
x can be derived from interface ones, thanks to the inner equations (14). More
precisely, thanks to the relationship between x3 and g3 via the Schur complement
as stated in equation (8), the Dirichlet-Neumann iteration can be redeﬁned only
in terms of values of x3 and g3 .
1. Given xp3 , solve the Dirichlet problem in domain Ω1 and compute interface
ﬂux:
(1)p

(24)
g3 = S (1) xp3 − c3
2. Derive new value of interface trace from solution of Neumann problem in
domain Ω2 :

(25)

Finally, xp3 and xp+1
satisfy the following relation:
3
(1)

(2)

S (2) xp+1
= −S (1) xp3 + c3 + c3

(26)

Equation (26) shows that the Dirichlet-Neumann iteration is a relaxation iteration for the coupled global problem whose condense form stated in equation (17)
can be written:
(1)
(2)
(27)
(S (1) + S (2) )x3 = c3 + c3
The iteration matrix for the error of this method is derived from equation (26):
xp+1
= −S (2)−1 S (1) xp3 + S (2)−1 c3 = −S (2)−1 S (1) xp3 + S (2)−1 Sx3
3
= −S (2)−1 (S − S (2) )xp3 + S (2)−1 Sx3 = −S (2)−1 Sxp3 + xp3 + S (2)−1 Sx3
(28)
and so:
− x3 = (I − S (2)−1 S)(xp3 − x3 ) = −S (2)−1 S (1) )(xp3 − x3 )
xp+1

(29)

Domain Decomposition Methodology with Robin Interface

Equation (29) shows that the method converges if and only if S (2)−1 S (1) < 1.
This means that S (2) must be, in some sense, larger than S (1) . Suppose the two
domains are geometrically symmetric, with the same thermal conductivity, then
the S (1) and S (2) matrices are identical. If the thermal conductivity is diﬀerent
from one domain to the other, the ratio between the two matrices is equal to the
ratio between the thermal conductivity of both domains. This means that the
Dirichlet-Neumann iteration will converge if the Dirichlet problem is solved in
the domain with lower conductivity and the Neumann problem in the domain
with the higher conductivity. The physical interpretation is that the domain
with the higher conductivity receives the heat ﬂux on the interface from the
domain with the lower conductivity and in return imposes its temperature on
the interface.
Convergence can be obtained by introducing a suitable over-relaxation parameter β:
p+ 1
= (1 − β)xp3 + βx3 2
(30)
xp+1
3
p+ 1

where x3 2 is given by the simple Dirichlet-Neumann iteration like in equation
(26). This leads to a new iteration matrix for the error:
xp+1
− x3 = (I − βS (2)−1 S)(xp3 − x3 )
3

(31)

Since S (2) and S are symmetric positive deﬁnite, I − βS (2)−1 S < 1 if β is
small enough. Unfortunately, if the Neumann problem is not solved on the right
side, β may have to be chosen very small and, in such a case, the convergence
is very slow. Furthermore, it may be very diﬃcult to ﬁnd the right value of β if
the materials are heterogeneous on both sides of the interface.

domain Ω1 and Ω2 via a mixed condition, leading to a Robin problem in Ω2 :

g3 = S (1) xp3 − c3

(2)

(2)

(1)

(2)

(S (1) + S (2) + A33 − A33 )x3 = c3 + c3

the iteration matrix for the error of this method is given by the following equation:

Domain Decomposition Methodology with Robin Interface

The method converges if and only if (S (2) + A33 )−1 (S (1) − A33 ) < 1. It
can be the case, even though S (2) is not larger than S (1) , provided that the
(2)
augmentation matrix A33 is close to the Shur complement of domain Ω1 , S (1) .
(2)
If A33 = S (1) , the method converges in only one iteration: it is a direct method.
This property can be also derived from the elimination of inner unknowns of
domain Ω1 in global system (16), that reduces the system as follows in Ω2 :

Equation (44) means that the restriction in Ω2 of the solution of the global
coupled problem is solution of a generalized local Robin problem, where the
operator in the Robin condition is the Schur complement of domain Ω1 .
This is hardly a surprise on a physical point of view. The Schur complement
is the discretization of Dirichlet-Neumann mapping. If a temperature and a ﬂux
satisfy the relation given by equation (8), they are respectively the trace and the
ﬂux of solution of local problem (6).
A generalized Robin boundary condition sets a constitutive law for the interface. If the constitutive law on interface of domain Ω2 is such that the trace
and the ﬂux of the local problem in domain Ω2 with the corresponding Robin
boundary condition are the trace and ﬂux of the solution of the local problem in
domain Ω1 , it entails that the solution of Robin problem in Ω2 is the restriction
of the global coupled problem. The optimal generalized Robin condition forces
the boundary of a domain to behave in the same way as the boundary of the
neighboring domain.
3.3

Robin-Robin Method

The Dirichlet problem in domain Ω1 can be also replaced by a Robin problem
similar to (40). It can be proved that the iteration matrix for the error of the
Robin-Robin method is equal to:
(S (2) + A33 )−1 (S (1) − A33 )(S (1) + A33 )−1 (S (2) − A33 )
(2)

(45)

Equation (45) means that performing a Robin-Robin iteration is equivalent to
performing alternatively a Dirichlet-Robin and a Robin-Dirichlet iteration.

Conclusion

The coupling algorithms based on Robin interface conditions have many interesting features. First, Robin boundary condition can always be formulated in such a

320

F.-X. Roux

way that associated local problem is always well posed, even though the Neumann
problem is not. Secondly, it is not necessary to impose the Robin condition on the
”right” side to get convergence. It can even be imposed on both sides.
In practice however, it is not possible to compute the exact Schur complement that deﬁnes the optimal Robin interface condition, for several reasons. Its
computation is very expensive and it is a dense operator that couples all interface unknowns. At continuous level, the Dirichlet-Neumann mapping is not
local. Furthermore, it can be computed only for linear problems with adequate
variational formulation.
Nevertheless, there are several approximation methods for the DirichletNeumann mapping. It can be done by deﬁning a local approximation of the
continuous operator, like in the methods to set up approximate absorbing conditions for wave equation [2], and by discretizing it. The analysis can also be
performed directly on the discrete operator.
Any physical approach to set up the constitutive law associated with the
optimal Dirichlet-Neumann mapping can be valuable as well.
Also, purely algebraic approaches, like the ones developed in [3] can also be used
to compute a sparse approximation of the Schur complement. This methodology
has already been successfully used for various coupled ﬂuid-structure problems.
