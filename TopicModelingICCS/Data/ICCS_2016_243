Abstract
Understanding retweeting mechanism and predicting retweeting behavior is an important and valuable
task in user behavior analysis. In this paper, aiming at providing a general method for improving retweeting behavior prediction performance, we propose a probabilistic matrix factorization model (RTPMF)
incorporating user social network information and message semantic relationship. The contributions of
this paper are three-fold: (1) We convert predicting user retweeting behavior problem to solve a probabilistic matrix factorization problem; (2) Following the intuition that user social network relationship
will affect the retweeting behavior, we extensively study how to model social information to improve
the prediction performance; and (3) We also incorporate message semantic embedding to constrain the
objective function by making a full use of additional the messages’ content-based and structure-based
features. The empirical results and analysis demonstrate that our method signiﬁcantly outperform the
state-of-the-art approaches.
Keywords: retweeting behavior prediction, probabilistic matrix factorization, social, embedding

Introduction

Social media platform with its unique information propagation ability in people’s daily life plays an increasingly important role. Every day large amounts of information are generated and spread by retweeting mechanism which is an important social function. Retweeting makes messages easy to reshare from
user to user in a viral manner. Thus, exploring on user retweeting behavior not only can make us better
understand information diffusion in social networks, but also help get an idea of true intentions from
the perspective of human behaviors. Therefore, understanding retweeting mechanism and predicting
retweeting behavior is an important and valuable task in user behavior analysis.
The task of predicting user retweeting behavior has been studied extensively over the past decade
[9, 15, 12]. A common weaknesses of these methods is that they only consider the property of user
or message for retweeting prediction. In fact, in addition to the retweeting behavior data, some additional sources of information can also be contained in social networks. Figure 1 illustrates the social

contextual information concerning retweeting behavior. From Figure 1, we can see that except usermessage retweeting matrix, there are user-user relationship matrix and message-message relationship
matrix. We hold the intuition that both user social relationship and message semantic relationship can
be employed to enhance retweeting prediction. The intuition behind is that given a message users ﬁrst
read the message and then decide whether retweet it or not. In other words, users only retweet those
messages that they have read and are interested in the content of the messages. Hence, being read is
the necessary prerequisite for retweeting. Typically, in Twitter user uA is a follower of user uB . If uB
is followed by many people. We can believe that uB may be an authority or an icon. Then uA is more
likely to read messages issued by uB . Moreover, if uA follows many people, then uA maybe only select some of messages posted by his followee to read. As a result, the probability that uA reads and
retweets uB ’ message reduces. In this way, the social inﬂuence is different from traditional friendship
or follwoee-follower relationship. In addition, if a message m has been read by uA , uA will not retweets
it if uA is not interested in the content of m. Therefore, both of user and message aspects are important
for user retweeting behavior prediction. However, most of the existing methods simply ignore such side
information, or intrinsically, are not capable of exploiting it.
To address this problem, we introduce a probabilistic matrix factorization model, which integrates
the user-message retweeting data, user social relationship and message semantic relationship into a uniﬁed framework. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst formulate the retweeting behavior prediction problem as a
probabilistic matrix factorization problem to solve. Secondly, we incorporate user social relationship
and message semantic relationship into the objective function by designing user social embedding and
semantic embedding constraint regularization terms on the latent user and message feature space, respectively. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our model compared
with the state-of-the-art approaches. Experimental results clearly demonstrate the better effectiveness of
our model for retweeting behavior prediction.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: At ﬁrst, we introduce our proposed model, and derive its inference and solution algorithms. Subsequently, we experimentally evaluate our method using

benchmark datasets and summarize our results. Finally, we brieﬂy present an overview of the major
approaches for retweeting behavior prediction and conclude this paper.

Proposed Approach

In this section, we ﬁrstly give some notations and describe the problem we study. Subsequently, we
introduce our proposed method which exploits user social embedding and message semantic embedding.
Finally, we give the solution and prove the correctness of it.

2.1

Problem Statement

Suppose that we have M users with the i-th user denoted as ui and N messages with the j-th message
denoted as mj . We denote the user-message retweeting matrix as R ∈ RM ×N with its (i,j)-th entry
Rij =

1
0

if ui retweets mj ,
otherwise.

Let U ∈ RL×M and V ∈ RL×N be the latent user and message feature matrices with column vectors
Ui and Vj representing the latent user-speciﬁc and message-speciﬁc feature vectors respectively. R will
be approximated by U T V in this paper. In this way, the retweeting prediction problem is converted to
predicting the unobserved entries in the user-message retweeting matrix based on the observed entries
and other factors. In our model, we explore and utilize user social embedding and message semantic
embedding to constrain the objective function.

2.2

Modeling User Retweeting Behavior

Considering the user-message retweeting matrix R, we deﬁne the conditional distribution over the observed retweeting behaviors as:

where N (·|μ, σ 2 ) is the probability density function of the Gaussian distribution with mean μ and
variance σ 2 . Iij is the indicator function that its deﬁnition is the same to R. We also place zero-mean
Gaussian priors on user and message feature vectors:

Modeling User Social Embedding (USE)

When a user receives a message that is posted by one of his followee, he usually ﬁrst reads it and
then see whether the message is interesting and whether it is worth being retweeting. Moreover, if the
message is sent by a close friend or authoritative, he is more likely to retweet it. Zhang et al. (2013)
have proved that a user’s social connections (friends, follower or followee) will affect his retweeting
behavior. Then, we will introduce how to explore the utilization of user social relationship information
to facilitate retweeting prediction.
We deﬁne a M × M matrix S to represent those user social embedding (USE) information. In social
networks, a user may follow many users and be followed by many users. Different followees that he
follows should have different inﬂuences on him when he decide whether retweets or not. Given a user
ui , a message that is posted by uj , and ui is a follower of uj , we hold that if uj is followed by many
users then uj may have great deal of inﬂuence on ui ; on the other hand, if ui follows lots of users then
uj may have small impact on ui . Based on this idea, we deﬁne the (i,j)-th entry of S as:
Sij =

g(uj )
(S)
× Iij
f (ui ) + g(uj )

(5)
(S)

where f (ui ) is the number of who ui follows and g(ui ) is the number of who follows ui . Iij is the
indicator function that is equal to 1 if ui is a follower of uj and equal to 0 otherwise.
To formalize the user social embedding, we formulate the following equation over the latent user
feature vector:
P (Ui − Uj |σu2 ) =

L

[N (Uki − Ukj |0, σu2 ]Sij .

2.4

Modeling Message Semantic Embedding (MSE)

Most existing retweeting behavior prediction approaches always assume that messages are independent.
In fact, messages in social networks are semantic-based networked data. Similar to user social relationship, a message mi can also have its neighbors (like friends for users) that are similar to mi from the
semantic perspective. However, previous works fail to discover these intrinsic geometric structure of the
message in the latent space.
To deal with this limitation, we ﬁrst use clustering algorithm to partition messages into semantic
groups where the messages’ vectors are constructed based on structure and content features. Many
works [13, 6, 12, 16] have shown that messages’ structural characteristics that whether contains hashtag,
URL, media or not, are important factors for effecting users’ retweeting behaviors. Hence, we take the
number of hashtag, URL, media and mention as structure-based features in this paper. Moreover, there
is a consensus among researches that a user prefers to retweet a message which he is interested in.
For better describing and understanding messages in semantic space, we use paragraph vector [4], an
unsupervised vector-based approach which can model rich semantic information, to learn the vector
representation of the message. Hence, a message’s vector is a concatenation of two parts: one from
structure-based features and one from content-based features. In this paper, K-means algorithm is used
for clustering. After clustering, messages with similar semantics are clustered into a group. We believe
that messages in the same semantic group are neighbors to each other.
Next, we introduce message semantic embedding (MSE) and assume that a message should lie close
to its neighbors in the latent user space. To encode the semantic information, we construct an adjacency
matrix T ∈ RN ×N with the (i,j)-th entry deﬁned as:
T (i, j) = α × Sstructure (i, j) + (1 − α) × Scontent (i, j)

(7)
359

RTPMF: Leveraging User and Message . . .

where α is employed to control the contribution of each factor and we set α = 0.5 in this paper.
Sstructure (i, j) and Scontent (i, j) are cosine similarities based on structure-based feature vectors and
content-based feature vectors mentioned above, respectively.
Then, we use the following equation over the latent message vector to perform the message semantic
embedding:

P (Vi − Vj |σv2 ) =

[N (Vki − Vkj |0, σv2 ]Tij .

RTPMF: Retweeting Prediction Model

As analyzed in Section 1, in order to reﬂect the phenomenon that users’ social associations and messages’ semantic relationships will affect users’ judgement of retweeting the message, we model the
problem of retweeting prediction using the graphical model described in Figure 2, which fuses usermessage retweeting matrix, user social embedding and message semantic embedding with matrix factorization to obtain a consistent and compact feature representation. Then through Bayesian inference
in Figure 2, we model the conditional distribution of U and V over the observed retweeting data, user
social and message semantic information as:

P (U, V |R, σR

Solution

As mentioned above, we utilize U T V to approximate R in this paper. (U T V )ij reﬂects the possibility
that ui retweets mj . Therefore, it is needs to ensure that (U T V )ij is nonnegative. To address this problem, we adopt an alternative optimization algorithm which can converge to a local optimal solution for
Eq.(11). In each round round of iteration, U and V are updated as:
Uij ← Uij

Vij ← Vij

(13)

It is easy to verify that the updating rules in Eq.(12) and Eq.(13) do satisfy the above KKT condition.
Furthermore, R, L and ξ are nonnegative, so U and V are nonnegative during the updating process.
That is, (U T V )ij is nonnegative. Until now, we prove the correctness of the updating rules. It can be
proved that the updating rules are guaranteed to converge. Since the proof process is similar to that in
[3], to save space, we omit the detailed proof of the convergence.

Experimental Analysis
Datasets Description

We use a publicly available Sina Weibo (a Twitter style website in China) dataset collected by Zhang
et al. [15] to evaluate the performance of our model. Our proposed RFPMF is quite general, and it can
be utilized to predict retweeting behavior with any sparse user-message retweeting matrices. Here, we
reconstruct four sub-datasets which are randomly selected from the above dataset for testing. Table 1
show the detailed statistics of the four sub-datasets. From Table 1, we can observe that the user-message
retweeting matrices are very sparse.

Parameter Settings

In this section, we will investigate the effect of different parameter settings when implementing our

all our experiments.
4.2.1 Tradeoff Parameters
In our proposed model, the parameters λU , λV , λu and λv play important roles. Especially λu and λv ,
they control how much our model should incorporate the information of the user social embedding and
the message semantic embedding. In the extreme case, if we use a very small value of λu and λv , we
only mine the user-message retweeting matrix for matrix factorization. On the other side, if we employ
a very large value of λu and λv , the user social embedding and the message semantic embedding will
dominate the learning process. In many cases, we do not want to set λu and λv to these extreme values
since they will potentially hurt the retweeting prediction performance.
The impacts of λU , λV , λu and λv on D200 , D500 and D1000 generally share the same trends as the
impacts of these parameters on D100 datasets. Hence we only discuss the inﬂuences on D100 for RTPMF
here due to the space limitation. Taking the scales of R, U , and V into account (Table 1), we scan orders
of magnitude and try different combinations of parameters on D100 dataset as shown in Table 2. From
the results, we can see that the values of λu and λv impact the prediction results signiﬁcantly, which
demonstrates that incorporating the user social embedding and message semantic embedding greatly
improves the prediction performance. We use the ﬁfth row on all the four datasets. Although they are
not the perfect ones, the following experiments demonstrate they are adequate.
4.2.2

Number of the Hidden Features

Our model trains U and V to ﬁnd an appropriate L-dimensional joint latent space to represent users and
messages. How to set L is important for prediction performance. If L is to small, the users and messages
cannot be well represented and discriminated in the latent space. If L is too large, the computational
complexity will be considerably increased. Thus, we conduct experiments with L ranging from 5 to
50 on the four datasets with different training data settings. Here, 60% training data means that we
randomly select 60% of the retweeting data from the user-message retweeting matrix as the training

data to predict the remaining 40% of retweeting data. The results are shown in Figure 3, from which
we can see that with the hidden feature number L increasing, the accuracy increases gradually. It shows
obviously that when L > 30, accuracy increases slow. Considering the performance and time efﬁciency,
we choose L = 30 as the latent space dimension in our experiments.
4.2.3

Number of Iterations

When using alternate iterative algorithm to solve problem, it always needs to predeﬁne a proper number
of updating iterations to get a good performance while avoid overﬁtting. Here we use D100 vs. 60%
training data and D100 vs. 80% training data to validate this parameter. In each iteration, we record
the MAE and RMSE values. Figure 4 illustrates the impacts of the number of iterations. It can be observed that both MAE and RMSE values decrease gradually with the number of iterations increasing. It
shows that, by incorporating effective regularizers, our method successfully avoids overﬁtting problem.
Besides, it is better to run 60 iterations in order to reach a converged result with an acceptable time cost.

4.3

Performance and Analysis

Table 3 shows the results with 80% training data for our proposed model. To insure fairness, only the best
reported results for Zhang et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2015) are presented, measured by 10-fold cross
validation. The list is not exhaustive and because of differences in training/testing data splits the results
are not directly comparable. It is produced here only for reference. From the results, we can draw the
following observations: (1) RTPMF consistently obtains good performance in all datasets with different
sparseness which demonstrates that our models have good robustness; (2) RTPMF could generate better
results than the social inﬂuence locality based models (LRC) and the state-of-the-art matrix factorization
based algorithm (MNMFRP). In general, the results suggest that our proposed model provides a new
thought for retweeting behavior prediction.

Related Work

Existing researches concerning retweeting behavior can be roughly divided into two streams. One stream
focuses on explaining user retweeting behavior; while the other stream addresses the problem of predicting retweeting behavior.
To identify the affected factors of user retweeting behavior, a lot of works have been put forward
from different perspectives, including user survey [2, 1, 8] and data statistics [11, 7]. A common ground
of these methods is that tweet’s content and user inﬂuence are two important aspects of affecting user
retweeting behavior.
With respect to the prediction of user retweeting behavior, there also exists a wide spectrum of works,
including topic-level probabilistic graph model [5], conditional random ﬁelds [9], social inﬂuence factor
graph model [15], non-parametric Bayesian model [16] and nonnegative matrix factorization [12]. The
above approaches mainly based on the content-based and/or structure-based features to predict user
retweeting behavior. Besides, some works [14, 6, 10] tried to use other features, such as user feature,
retweet history, social status and temporal information, to predict retweeting behavior. However, these
approaches always focus on exploring user-based and message-based feature to predict and assume that
users and messages are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). They ignore social relationships
among users and semantic relationships among messages.
Recently, Zhang et al. (2013) and Wang et al. (2015) utilized social inﬂuence to improve the performance of retweeting prediction. They are the state-of-the-art approaches for retweeting prediction.
However, they have to compute the similarity between every pair of users to determine their neighborhoods which leads to expensive computation. This is not computationally feasible for retweeting prediction with millions of users in social networks. Besides, semantic relationships among messages are also
ignored. Nevertheless, data sparsity, scalability and prediction quality are still the crucial challenges for
retweeting behavior prediction.

Conclusion

In this study, we put forward a probabilistic matrix factorization model, which exploits user social embedding and message semantic embedding to constrain the objective function, for retweeting behavior
prediction. To validate the performance of our proposed model, we construct extensive experiments. The
experimental results reveal that the proposed method can effectively improve performance of retweeting
behavior prediction. In future work, we will explore combing user interaction information to further
depict the user social relationship.
