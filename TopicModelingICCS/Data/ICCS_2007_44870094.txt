Abstract. Mining useful information from a large amount of biological data is
becoming important, but most data mining research in bioinformatics is limited
to molecular sequence data. We have developed a set of algorithms for
analyzing hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions between protein and
RNA. Analysis of the most representative set of protein-RNA complexes
revealed several interesting observations: (1) in both hydrogen bond and van
der Waals interactions, arginine has the highest interaction propensity, whereas
cytosine has the lowest interaction propensity; (2) side chain contacts are more
frequent than main chain contacts in amino acids, whereas backbone contacts
are more frequent than base contacts in nucleotides; (3) amino acids, in which
side chain contacts are dominant, reveal more diverse interaction propensities
than nucleotides; and (4) valine rarely binds to any nucleotide. The interaction
patterns found in this study should prove useful for determining binding sites in
protein-RNA complexes.

1 Introduction
As the full genome sequences of several organisms are known, discovering useful
information from the huge, noisy biological data has become an interesting problem.
Many research of data mining in bioinformatics are limited to biological sequence
data of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and protein. Biological sequences are
easy to analyze due to their sequential nature and have many well-developed
algorithms since they can be treated as strings of characters. The structure of a
molecule is much more complex than its sequence but plays an important role since it
determines the biological function of the molecule. However, there have been few
attempts to mine the structures of molecules, because much less is known about the
structures than the sequences and there is no readily usable algorithm to handle
structural data. However, an increasing number of the three-dimensional structures of
molecules is known recently and continues to increase in public databases. The
sequence of a molecule is a string of four bases and twenty amino acids, respectively,
and is relatively simple to handle. The three-dimensional structure data of a molecule
contains the x, y, and z coordinate values of all the atoms contained in the molecules
and the information on embedded structure elements. Therefore, for the same
molecule, its structure data is much larger and more complex than its sequence data.

Mining Molecular Structure Data for the Patterns of Interactions

95

Over the past years a variety of problems concerned with protein-DNA complexes
have been investigated (Deng et al., 1999; Luscombe et al., 2001), but protein-RNA
complexes have received much less attention despite their importance. In contrast to
the regular helical structure of DNA, RNA molecules form complex secondary and
tertiary structures consisting of stems, loops, and pseudoknots. The structural
elements arranged into three-dimensional space are often recognized by specific
proteins. RNA structures display hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, and hydrophobic
groups that can interact with small molecules to form specific contacts. However, it is
not clear how proteins interact with RNA with specificity.
Since our previous study on hydrogen-bonding interactions between protein and
RNA (Kim et al., 2003), the structures of many protein-RNA complexes have been
determined. In this study we attempt a more rigorous study of the interactions by
considering van der Waals interactions as well as hydrogen-bonding interactions in a
new, extensive dataset of protein-RNA complexes. The primary focus of this work is
to find how proteins selectively bind specific sites of RNA molecules in both types of
interactions. The rest of this paper presents a set of algorithms for analyzing
hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions and the interaction patterns
discovered from a new dataset of 45 protein-RNA complexes.

2 Identifying Hydrogen Bonds and van der Waals Contacts
2.1 Datasets of Protein-RNA Complexes
The protein-RNA complex structures were obtained from the PDB database (Berman
et al. 2000). The complexes that were determined by X-ray crystallography with a
resolution of 3.0 Å or better were selected. As of January 2006, there were 312
protein-RNA complexes in PDB and the number of complexes with a resolution of
3.0 Å or better was 207. We used PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al. 1997) for similarity
search on each of the protein and RNA sequences in these 207 protein-RNA
complexes, in order to eliminate the equivalent amino acids or nucleotides in the
homologous protein or RNA structures. 45 out of 207 protein-RNA complexes were
left as the representative, nonhomologous complexes after running the PSI-BLAST
program with an E value of 0.001 and an identity value of 90% or below. The final
dataset of 45 protein-RNA complexes was used in our study (Table 1).

2.2 Hydrogen Bonds and van der Waals Contacts
The number of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) between amino acids and nucleotides in
protein-RNA complexes was calculated using CLEAN and HBPLUS version 3.15

96

K. Han and C. Nepal

(McDonald and Thornton 1994). The positions of hydrogen atoms (H) were inferred
from the surrounding atoms, as hydrogen atoms are invisible in purely X-ray-derived
structures. H-bonds were identified by finding all proximal atom pairs between Hbond donors (D) and acceptors (A) that satisfy the following geometric criteria:
contacts with maximum D-A distance of 2.7 Å, maximum H-A distance of 2.5 Å, and
minimum D-H-A and H-A-AA angles set to 90˚, where AA is an acceptor antecedent.
All protein-RNA bonds were extracted from the HBPLUS output files.
The criteria considered for the van der Waals interactions are: contacts with
maximum D-A distance of 3.9 Å, maximum H-A distance of 2.5 Å, and minimum DH-A and H-A-AA angles set to 90˚. The interactions that are considered as H-bonds
are not included in van der Waals interactions. The definitions of H-bonds and van
der Waals interactions are slightly different from those used by Jones et al. (2001).
2.3 Binding Propensity
Counting the number of H-bonds does not yield precise interaction propensities
because it does not take into account the number of residues in the complex and on
the surface of the complex. For example, amino acid A may have a weak propensity,
even though it may be involved in many H-bonds or may occur very frequently.
Therefore, we employ a function for determining propensities that considers H-bond
numbers, number of amino acids on the surface, nucleotide numbers and explosion
values. The propensity function is based on that reported by Moodie et al. (1996), but
we modified their function to determine the interaction propensities of amino acids
and nucleotides pair on the surface of a complex. Amino acids are considered to be on
the surface if their relative accessibility exceeds 5% according to the NACCESS
program (Hubbard and Thornton 1993).
The interaction propensity Pab between amino acid a and nucleotide b is defined by
equation (1), where Nab is the number of residues of amino acid a hydrogen bonding
to nucleotide b, ∑Nij is the total number of amino acids hydrogen bonding to any
nucleotide, Na is the number of residues of amino acid a, ∑Ni is the total number of
amino acid residues, Nb is the number of nucleotide b, ∑Nj is the total number of
nucleotides, and the numbers refer to residues on the surface. The numerator Nab/∑Nij
represents the ratio of the co-occurrences of amino acid a binding with nucleotide b,
to the total number of all amino acids binding to any nucleotide on the surface. The
term Na/∑Ni of the denominator represents the ratio of the frequency of amino acid a
to that of all amino acids on the surface, and the second term Nb/∑Nj represents the
ratio of the frequency of nucleotide b to that of all nucleotides on the surface.

∑ N ij
Pab =
Na ⋅ Nb
∑ Ni ⋅ ∑ N j

(1)

The interaction propensity is computed as the proportion of a particular amino acid
binding to a particular nucleotide on the surface divided by the proportion of each on
the surface. Therefore, the propensity represents the frequency of co-occurrence of
amino acids and nucleotides in protein-RNA complexes, for every pair of amino acids
and nucleotides. A propensity greater than 1 indicates that the given amino acid

Mining Molecular Structure Data for the Patterns of Interactions

occurs more frequently in combination with a given nucleotide on the surface,
whereas a propensity less than 1 indicates that the amino acid occurs less frequently.
2.4 Structure Elements of Protein and RNA
An RNA nucleotide consists of sugar, phosphoric acid, and base. A base consists of a
fixed number of atoms that provide important clues for extracting base pairs and
classifying them. Base pairs are formed by hydrogen bonding between the atoms of
bases. For example, the canonical A-U pair has two hydrogen bonds between N1 of
adenine (A) and N3 of uracil (U), and between N6 of A and O4 of U. Thus, we can
establish definite rules for hydrogen bonding between fixed atoms, which we call base
pair rules. Base pairs can be classified into canonical base pairs (Watson-crick base
pairs) and non-canonical base pairs. We consider base pairs of 28 types (Tinoco 1993)
comprising of both canonical and non-canonical base pairs. Base pair rules are used
for extracting base pairs and secondary and tertiary structural elements of RNA.
In this study, the secondary structure elements of protein are categorized into four
types: helix (α-helix, 3/10 helix and π-helix), sheet (ß-ladder and ß-bridge), turn
(hydrogen-bonded turn), and others (bend and other structures). These secondary
structure elements are assigned using the DSSP program (Kabsch and Sander 1983).
The secondary structure elements of RNA are categorized into two types: paired and
unpaired. If at least one H-bond exists between the base atoms of two nucleotides,
these nucleotides are considered to be paired. If not, they are considered to be
unpaired. If an H-bond exists between other parts of two nucleotides than the base
part, the two nucleotides are considered to be unpaired.
2.5 Algorithms for Extracting Secondary and Tertiary Structures of RNA
The first part of the algorithm extracts the secondary and tertiary structures of the
RNA. The second part generates a visual representation of the RNA structure by
integrating this information with knowledge of the coordinates of the nucleotides.
1. From the PDB files extract H-bonds that link the base of one nucleotide and that
of another, and classify the H-bonds into the 28 types of base pairs using the base
pair rules; they are then recorded in the Base Pair List.
2. Extract the RNA sequence data from the PDB and records it in RNA-SEQ. This
contains information on all nucleotides in the RNA, which is used again in
Step 4.
3. Derive the three-dimensional coordinates of the nucleotides. We define the
average coordinate value of all the atoms that make up a nucleotide as the threedimensional coordinate value of the nucleotide.
4. Integrate the sequence data in RNA-SEQ with the base pair data in the Base Pair
List. All the nucleotides in RNA-SEQ are matched to the nucleotides in the Base
Pair List to determine the bonding relationships between the nucleotides.
5. Integrate the three dimensional coordinates of the nucleotides obtained in Step 3
with the RNA structure data obtained in Step 4 and visualize the RNA structure.
2.6 Algorithms for Analyzing Protein-RNA Complexes
This algorithm analyzes the H-bonds and van der Waals contacts and generates the
patterns of binding between protein and RNA.

1. Extract hydrogen bonds from the structure data of the protein-RNA complexes and
assign secondary structure elements to each atom of the proteins.
2. Extract only hydrogen bonds that link RNA bases to get base pairs. Information on
the base pairs obtained in this step, together with the information about the
secondary structure elements of the protein obtained in Step 1, is used to identify
the interaction pattern between protein and RNA at the secondary level.
3. Classify the amino acids into main chain and side chain. This can provide
information on which type tends to form hydrogen bonds with nucleotides.
4. Show the analysis results between protein and RNA at various structure levels.

3 Results and Discussion
The algorithms were implemented in a web-based program called PRI-Modeler
(http://wilab.inha.ac.kr/primodeler/) using Visual C#. PRI-Modeler is executable
within a web browser on any Windows systems. Given one or more PDB files as
input, PRI-Modeler produces several files containing H-bonding or van der Waals
interactions between amino acids and nucleotides, secondary and tertiary structures of
RNA, and interaction patterns of protein-RNA complexes.

Fig. 1. Analysis of the interactions between protein and RNA using PRI-Modeler

Fig. 1 shows an exemplary user interface of PRI-Modeler. It consists of twenty
menu buttons and one text panel. When the user specifies the types of interactions to
analyze using the menu buttons (such as H-bonding interactions, van der Waals
interactions, hydrophobic interactions, aliphatic interactions, aromatic interactions,
positively and negatively charged interactions and polar interactions), PRI-Modeler
analyzes the specified interactions and displays the analysis results in the text panel.
The rest of this section presents some analysis results of 45 protein-RNA complexes.
Table 2 shows the hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions between amino
acids and nucleotides, and Fig. 2 shows their interaction propensities. There are a total

Mining Molecular Structure Data for the Patterns of Interactions

318 H-bonds and 1056 van der Waals contacts in the data set. Interestingly, both in
the H-bonding and van der Waals interactions, arginine (Arg) showed the highest
interaction propensity, whereas cytosine (C) showed the lowest interaction propensity
(Fig. 2). Amino acids show more diverse nature (H-bonding interaction propensity in
the range [0-2.44], and van der Waals interaction propensity in the range [0.04-3.16])
than nucleotides ([0.74-1.12] and [0.67-1.03], respectively). This indicates that amino
acids are more distinguishable than nucleotides by their interaction propensities.
Amino acids have a main chain in common, and nucleotides have a backbone in
common. In protein, both interactions are more frequently observed in the side chain
(average 73%) than in the main chain (average 27%). In contrast, the backbone part of
RNA has more interactions (average 62% in both interactions) than in the base part
(average 38%). Amino acids, in which side chain contacts are dominant, naturally
reveal more diverse interaction propensities than nucleotides. One of the reasons that
backbone contacts are more frequent than base contacts in nucleotides is that the
backbone part has more atoms and highly electronegative atoms than the base part,
which makes the backbone more favorable to form hydrogen bonds than the base.
Many amino acids show a strong preference for specific nucleotides with which
they form stable H-bonds. For example, amino acids that contain polar atoms (e.g.,
arginine and lysine) have a strong tendency to form H-bonds. In H-bonding
interactions, Arg-U, Gln-C, Arg-G, and Ser-A are the binding pairs with high
propensity. In van der Waals interactions, Arg-U, Arg-G, and Asn-U are the binding
pairs with high propensity. Valine rarely binds to any nucleotide.

zoomed in/out to get a clear perspective view. With programs like Rasmol
(http://www.umass.edu/microbio/rasmol/) and MOLSCRIPT (Per 1991), one cannot
easily obtain information about each nucleotide and the binding relations between
nucleotides, because the programs represent the structures at the atomic level. On the
other hand, PRI-Modeler shows not only the 3D configuration of RNA but also the
bonding relations and types of base pairs between nucleotides.

4 Conclusion
We have analyzed 318 hydrogen bonds and 1056 van der Waals contacts in the most
representative set of 45 protein-RNA complexes. The interaction propensity function
we developed for this analysis indicates the frequency of co-occurrences of amino
acids and nucleotides in the protein-RNA complexes for every combination of amino
acids and nucleotides. This interaction propensity function is more refined than others
since our primary focus for the analysis is RNA as well as protein. Amino acids, in
which side chain contacts are much more dominant than main chain contacts, reveal
more diverse interaction propensities than nucleotides, in which backbone contacts
are dominant. Since our analysis is restricted to protein-RNA complexes that were
crystallized and examined by X-ray crystallography, the analysis results may give rise
to a high proportion of strong hydrogen bonding interactions. Our long-term goal of
this study is to predict the structure of RNA binding protein, and we plan to extend
this study to predict binding sites of virus proteins.
