Abstract. This paper investigates how smoothing the Hamiltonian and
the cusp of the corresponding eigenfunction aﬀects the rate of convergence of the Rayleigh-Ritz method. A simple example from quantum
mechanics is used, with a basis of harmonic oscillator functions.

Introduction

This study is motivated by a computational problem in the electronic molecular
structure theory. It has been shown ( [1]) that the variational energy error of
a conﬁguration interaction(CI), or any other orbital-based method is slow (of
order O(L−3 ) or greater, where L is the maximum angular momentum in the
ﬁnite orbital basis). This behavior can be explained by the inability of the basis functions to describe the ”electron correlation cusps” of the wavefunction
introduced by the singularities of the Coulombic potential.
One possible approach that we are exploring is a perturbational one, in which
the reference problem has a Hamiltonian free of such singularities, and for which
the wavefunctions diﬀer signiﬁcantly from those of the true Hamiltonian only in
the vicinity of such cusps. Traditional CI methods are used to solve the reference problem, and geminal-based methods are employed to solve the low-order
Rayleigh-Schrödinger perturbation equations. The success of this approach is dependent upon ﬁnding a reference Hamiltonian for which the Rayleigh-Ritz (RR)
method converges far more rapidly than for the true Hamiltonian (see [2]).
This paper illustrates how the convergence of the RR method is accelerating
with the ”smoothing” of the Hamiltonian and of the corresponding groundstate wavefunction for a simple example from quantum mechanics. The singular
potential v used here is diﬀerent from the usual potentials used in quantum
chemistry, so we investigate whether the associated operator H is selfadjoint and
the RR method for this operator using a basis of harmonic oscillator functions
is convergent.

With the potential v(x) = −δ(x) the equation ( 1) has the ground-state energy E = −1/2, with the normalized wavefunction ψ(x) = exp(−|x|). With the
smoothed potential

third derivative for any a > 0. Moreover, ψa (x) → ψ(x) pointwise as a → ∞.
va (x) → 0 as a → ∞ for any x � = 0 andva (0) = −a − 1/2 → −∞ as a → ∞.

The Convergence of the RR Method

For eq. ( 1) with v(x) = −δ(x) the behavior of the energy error exhibited in
Figure 3 raises a serious question whether the method is just slowly convergent
or not convergent at all. In fact, convergence can be established by rigorous
mathematics outlined below.
A theorem in Michlin [6] (see also [5]) says that for a positive deﬁnite and
selfadjoint operator B with the domain DB ⊂ L2 dense in L2 the RR method
converges to the lowest exact eigenvalue E0 of the operator B provided that the
basis used {φm }m=0,1,2,... is complete in the energy space HB . The energy space
HB is the closure of DB in the B-norm:
�f �B = (f, Bf )1/2 .

for functions u, v ∈ H 1 ,where δ0 > 0. The Sobolev space H 1 = {f ∈ L2 , f ∈ L2 }

H 1 , δ0 > 0). In its general form, ( 12) is the main ingredient in proving that the
form t is closed. By a representation theorem ( see [3]) there exists a selfadjoint
operator T : D(T ) ⊂ H 1 ⊂ L2 → L2 , positive deﬁnite (with the same lower
bound δ0 as the form t) deﬁned by the relation (T u, v) = t(u, v) ∀u ∈ D(T ), ∀v ∈
H 1 . Moreover, its domain D(T ) is dense in the Hilbert space H 1 with the norm
� �Ht = t( , )1/2 .
This implies that HT -the closure of D(T ) in the norm � �Ht -is H 1 , since the
norms � �Ht and � �H 1 are equivalent. The basis {φm (x)}m=0,1,... is complete in
H 1 for any λ > 0 (see [4]) so the RR method is convergent for the operator T
and also for T − 1/2 − δ0 , which is the operator from eq. ( 1) with v(x) = −δ(x).
These considerations are for a ﬁxed λ, while the results from Figure 2 and 3
are for a λ varied to optimize (ψn , ψn ) for each n. The diﬀerence between the
results for a ﬁxed λ and λ optimized in the sense above can be seen in Figures
4 and 5. As shown in Table 2, λ = 2 maximizes the norm of ψn for n ≈ 70, so

the curves in Figures 4 and 5 coincide at this point. The norm error for optimal
λ is smaller than that for λ = 2 for all n, as expected, while the energy error is
lower for λ = 2 for small values of n (λ was optimized with respect to the norm).
After n ≈ 70 the energy error for ﬁxed λ is greater than that for optimized λ. So
the method is convergent both for ﬁxed and optimized λ, but the convergence is
very slow due to the inability of the basis functions to describe the cusp ψ(x).
