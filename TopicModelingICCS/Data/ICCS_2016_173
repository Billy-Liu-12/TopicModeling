Abstract
Frog population has been declining the past decade for habitat loss, invasive species, climate
change, and so forth. Therefore, it is becoming ever more important to monitor the frog
population. Recent advances in acoustic sensors make it possible to collect frog vocalizations
over large spatio-temporal scale. Through the detection of frog calling activity with collected
acoustic data, frog population can be predicted. In this paper we propose a novel method for
detecting frog calling activity using acoustic event detection and multi-label learning. Here,
frog calling activity consists of frog abundance and frog species richness, which denotes number
of individual frog calls and number of frog species respectively. To be speciﬁc, each segmented
recording is ﬁrst transformed to a spectrogram. Then, acoustic event detection is used to calculate frog abundance. Meanwhile, those recordings without frog calls are ﬁltered out. For
frog species richness, three acoustic features, linear predictive coeﬃcients, Mel-frequency Cepstral coeﬃcients and wavelet-based features are calculated. Then, multi-label learning is used
to predict frog species richness. Lastly, statistical analysis is used to reﬂect the relationship
between frog calling activity (frog abundance and frog species richness) and weather variables.
Experiment results show that our proposed method can accurately detect frog calling activity
and reﬂect its relationship with weather variables.

Introduction

Over the past decade, a dramatic decline of frog population has been noticed worldwide [9].
Reasons for this decline can be summarized as habitat loss, invasive species, climate change.
On one hand, frog population is rapidly declining, and on the other frogs are greatly important
for the environment. First, frogs are an integral part of the food web, and the decline of
their population can result in negative impacts through a whole-ecosystem. Second, frogs are

important indicator species for environmental health. Third, frogs are very useful in medical
research that beneﬁt humans1 . Therefore, it is becoming necessary to protect frogs.
To monitor the change of frog population and optimize the protection policy, a growing
number of researchers have shown interest in studying frogs [7, 3, 16]. Compared with counting
frogs by visual observation, hearing frog vocalizations is much easier. Consequently, frogs’
vocalizations are often used to study. Currently, there are two approaches for acosutic data
collection. The traditional ﬁeld survey method, which requires ecologists to physically visit
sites for collecting bioacoustic data, is both time-consuming and costly [13]. Comparatively,
recent advances in acoustic sensor techniques have greatly extended the spatio-temporal scale
for collecting frog vocalizations. By the aid of acoustic sensors, it is possible to record frog
vocalizations continuously and store them permanently. However, this technique provides us
several gigabytes of compressed data per acoustic sensor every day. Develop automatic methods
for exploring these quantities of acoustic data is becoming necessary.
Unfortunately, most previous methods focus on the recognition and classiﬁcation of shortterm recordings (segmented frog syllables) [7, 3, 16]. Few studies have explored long-term
acoustic monitoring of frogs. Canavero et al [4] studied the relationship between calling activity of anuran assemblage and seasonal changes of weather factors such as temperature and
rainfall. However, the activity of anuran species was simply quantiﬁed as rank abundance estimations of calling mate, which cannot accurately reﬂect frog species richness of each segmented
recording. Ospina et al [10, 1] introduced a method named Region of Interest to identify the
presence/absence of each species. Then, the detection model was built based on Hidden Markov
Model with ﬁve frog parameters: maximum and minimum frequency, bandwidth, duration and
slice between notes. The disadvantage of this method is that it can detecte the presence/absence of each frog species, but not frog abundance2 . Akementins et al [2] explored the inﬂuence
of abiotic cues on calling activity. Like [4], frog calling activity was quantiﬁed according to the
numerical classiﬁcation scheme. However, this method cannot accurately recognize frog species
of each segmented recording. Xie et al [14] introduced acoustic indices for frog calling activity
detection. Four indices, spectral peak track index, harmonic structure index, oscillation structure index, and Shannon entropy index, were selectively combined for detecting frog calling
activity with a Gaussian mixture model. Then, the correlation between the frog calling activity
and climate information was studied. However, the correlation was not strong because of the
limitation of recording duration.
In this paper, we proposed a novel method for detecting frog calling activity. Here, frog
calling activity, which consists of frog abundance and frog species richness, is detected based
on acoustic event detection and multi-label learning. Frog abundance and frog species richness
denote the number of individual frog calls and the number of diﬀerent frog species of each
segmented recording, respectively. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst sample 10 seconds from every 10-minute
recordings. Then, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to obtain a spectrogram for
each 10-second recording. Next, acoustic event detection is applied to the spectrogram image
for frog abundance detection, which is also used to recognize those recordings without frog
calls. Finally, multi-label learning is used to calculate frog species richness with three acoustic
features: linear predictive coeﬃcients, Mel-frequency Cepstral coeﬃcients and wavelet-based
features. After detecting frog abundance and frog species richness, statistical analysis is used
to ﬁnd the relationship between frog calling activity (frog abundance and frog species richness)
and weather variables (temperature and rainfall). Experiment results show that our proposed
method can accurately monitor frog calling activity and reﬂect its relationship with weather

Acquisition of frog call recordings

All recordings selected for this study were obtained from three sites in Queensland, Australia:
Kiyomi dam, Stony creek dam and BG creek dam, using a battery-powered acoustic sensor
(stored in a weather proof metal box) with an external microphone. The recordings were stored
on 16GB SD cards in 64 kbps MP3 mono format. All recordings were collected from February,
2014 to April, 2014, because it is the breeding season in Queensland when male frogs make calls
to attract female for reproducing. All recordings started around sunset, ﬁnished around sunrise
every day and have 12 hour duration. We sampled 10-second recordings every 10 minutes for
those continuous recordings. There are 4170, 4908, and 1544 10-second recordings for Kiyomi
dam, Stony creek dam and BG creek dam respectively, because of data loss. A representative
sample of 342 10-second recordings was selected to train and evaluate the proposed method.
The ground truth of those 342 10-second recordings is generated by a frog expert who manually
tags each recording with frog species.
We ﬁrst manually inspected spectrograms of ten randomly selected call examples for each
frog species. Two parameters, dominant frequency and syllable duration, were then measured
and averaged, as listed in Table 1, which are used as prior information for subsequent analysis.

Frog abundance monitoring

Frog abundance is monitored through the detection of acoustic events in a spectrogram image.
Here, the spectrogram was generated by applying short-time Fourier transform (STFT) to each
10-second recording. Acoustic event detection, which consists of multiple image processing
steps, are modiﬁed from our previous study [15] and summarized as follows.
Step 1: Wiener ﬁlter
To de-noise and smooth the spectrogram, a 2-dimensional Wiener ﬁlter is applied to the spectrogram image over a 5 × 5 time-frequency grid, where the ﬁlter size is selected after the
consideration of trade-oﬀ between removing the background graininess and blurring acoustic
events.

(Stf − ν)
(1)
Sˆtf = μ +
σ2
where μ and σ 2 are local mean and variance, respectively. ν 2 is the noise variance estimated
by averaging all local variances.
Step 2: Spectral subtraction
After Wiener ﬁltering, the graininess has been removed. However, some noises such as wind,
insect, motor engine that cover the whole recording are still remained. Here, a modiﬁed spectral
subtraction is employed for dealing with those noises. Description of this algorithm can be found
in our previous study [16].
Step 3: Adaptive thresholding
Following noise reduction, the next step is to convert the noise reduced spectrogram Sˆtf into
b
for events detection. Here, an adaptive thresholding method named
the binary spectrogram Stf
Otsu thresholding [11] is employed to ﬁnd an optimal threshold.
φ2b (k) = w1 (k)w2 (k)[μ1 (k) − μ2 (k)]2

p(j) is calculated from the histogram as k, p(j) = n(j)/N are the values
where w1 (k) =
of the normalized gray level histogram, n(j) is the number of values in level j, N is the total
k
number of values over the whole spectrogram image, μ1 (k) = [ 0 p(j)x(j)]/w1 , x(j) is the
value at the center of the jth histogram bin. Then, the threshold, T0 , is calculated as
T0 = (φ2b1 (k) + φ2b2 (k))/2

(3)

Step 4: Events ﬁltering using dominant frequency and event area
To further remove those events that are not belong to frog species shown in Table 1, dominant
frequency (F0 ) and area (number of pixels) within the event boundary (Ar) are used for ﬁltering.
First, large acoustic events, whose area is larger than Alarge , are separated into small events,
because the area of frog calls to be classiﬁed in Table 1 is empirically smaller than Alarge . Then,
630

Detecting frog calling activity based on acoustic event detection and multi-label learning Jie Xie et al

dominant frequency is used to ﬁlter the events. First, the averaged frequency is calculated
by averaging the peak frequency within each acoustic event. Then, the event, whose averaged
frequency are not within allowed ﬂuctuation in both sides of dominant frequency, are discarded.
Finally, small acoustic events, whose area is smaller than Asmall , are ﬁltered. Those events,
whose average frequency are between 300 Hz and 800 Hz, are not ﬁltered using Asmall , because
the area of LTE (averaged frequency is between 300 Hz and 800 Hz) is smaller than Asmall .
Figure 2 shows the acoustic event detection results.
To calculate frog abundance of each segmented recording, the frog abundance is calculated
as follows.

Wavelet-based feature extraction for species richness analysis

Frog species richness is calculated by tagging each segmented recording. Since many segmented
recordings consist of multiple frog species, one direct solution is to assign each recording with
a set of labels (frog species) for explicitly expressing its semantics [17]. Therefore, multi-label
learning is adopt to tag each segmented recording.
Extracting discriminating features, which maximize between-group (inter-specie) dissimilarity and minimize within-group (intra-specie) dissimilarity, is very important for achieving
high classiﬁcation performance [7, 3]. In this study, feature extraction is performed based on
wavelet packet decomposition using a modiﬁed version of the method introduced in [16] and
summarized below.
For feature extraction, constructing a suitable frequency scale for wavelet packet (WP)
tree based on the dominant frequency of each frog species is the ﬁrst step, because diﬀerent
frog species tend to have diﬀerent dominant frequencies [6]. In [16], k-means clustering was
ﬁrst applied to the extracted dominant frequencies of training data. Then, the frequency
scale was built by sorting clustering centroids to construct the WP tree. In this study, the
prior information (F0 ) obtained from Table 1 is directly used to construct the WP tree. We
iteratively detect each WP tree sub-band node until the frequency range of each node includes
more than one F0 . Then, the WP tree of that particular sub-band node will be further split
until each sub-band node has only one dominant frequency value or none. After constructing
the frequency scale, adaptive frequency scaled wavelet packet decomposition is applied to each
segmented recording for feature extraction.
For each 10-second recording, it is represented as y(n), n = 1, ..., N , where N is the length
of each recording. Based on the y(n), detailed description for WP-based feature extraction is
list as follows:
Step 1: Add a Hamming window to the signal y(n) and perform wavelet packet decomposition
spaced in adaptive frequency scale as described in [16].

Diﬀerent from [16], the recording is ﬁrst segmented into frames using a Hamming window.
Then, all frames are divided into three equal parts, and WP-feature within each part is averaged,
respectively, because diﬀerent frog species within similar frequency band may exist in one
10-second recording, segmenting each recording into small parts might be able to keep the
information of diﬀerent frog species in the same frequency band. Besides WP-based feature,
two other acoustic features, linear predictive coeﬃcients (LPCs) and Mel-frequency Cepstral
coeﬃcients (MFCCs), are also calculated for the comparison.

Multi-label classiﬁcation for species richness analysis

Since many segmented recordings consist of calls from multiple frog species, frog call classiﬁcation can be framed as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem. However, previous studies have not
adopted multi-label learning to classify frog calls. Therefore, it is worth to investigate diﬀerent
multi-label learning algorithms for the classiﬁcation of multiple vocalizing frog species. In this
study, four multi-label learning algorithms, whose base classiﬁer is C4.5 decision tree, are employed: binary relevance (BR), classiﬁer chains (CC), random k-labEL Pruned Sets (RAKEL
and RAKEL1) [17]. The default parameter settings of those four multi-label learning algorithms
are used. The trained classiﬁer, which achieves the best classiﬁcation performance, is then used
to tag rest recordings. After tagging each 10-second recording, frog species richness is lastly
calculated as follows.

where frich (k) is the number of frog species of each tagged 10-second recording, K is the number

Experiment setup

Each 10-second recording is divided into frames of 512 samples and 50% frame overlap for STFT.
Alarge and Asmall , which are used for area ﬁltering in acoustic event detection, are empirically
set at 3000 pixels and 300 pixels, respectively. Allowed ﬂuctuations in both sides of dominant
frequency are 300 Hz for dominant frequency ﬁltering. For WP-based feature, window size and
overlap are 512 samples and 50%, the window function is a Hamming window. All algorithms
were programmed in Matlab 2014b except multi-label learning, which was implemented in Meka
1.7.74 .

Figure 3 shows the frog abundance result of three selected sites through the whole frog breeding
season. It can be found that the frog abundance of the same site changes a great deal over
time. In the Kiyomi dam, frog abundance is relatively high from February 21 to February 25.
However, frog abundance is quite low in two period, which are February 26 to March 11 and
April 07 to April 12. The highest abundance of this site is achieved on March 22. However, the
highest abundance for Stony creek dam and BG creek dam is obtained in February, which shows
that frog abundance of diﬀerent sites often varies a lot for diﬀerent environments. Recordings
of 47 days of all three sites have no frog calls. In the subsequent analysis, only those recordings
that consist of frog calls are used for frog species richness analysis.

The combination of multi-stage WP-based feature+LCPs and the RAkEL1 method achieves
the best performance. Therefore, this combination is used for the testing data. Figure 4 shows
the frog species richness of the three selected sites. For all the three sites, the variation of
species richness is not high, which shows that species richness of the same area is relatively
stable. However, frog species richness of BG creek dam has a smaller variation over the time
than Kiyomi dam and Stony creek dam. The comparison of the species richness for the three
sites is shown in Figure 5. In contrast to other sites, the species richness in BG creek dam is
the highest. This might be that BG creek dam is closer to a river and farther away from the
human community.

Statistical analysis

Multiple regression analysis is used to explore frog calling activity (frog abundance and frog
species richness) along weather variables (mean temperature and rainfall)5 . Frog calling activity is found to be highly correlated with mean temperature (F=5.18, P<0.05 for abundance,
and F=10.7, P<0.01 for species richness). To calculate the correlation between rainfall and

frog calling activity, we ﬁrst set the rainfall vaule as the dummy variable. Then, the correlation between frog calling activity and rainfall is also studied with multiple regression analysis
(F=4.63, P<0.05 for abundance, and F=4.64, P<0.05 for species richness). The statistical
analysis results indicate that frogs tend to make calls in the warm and humidity environment,
which is in accordance to previous studies [2, 4].

Conclusion and future work

Acoustic sensors are more widely used to monitor frog calling activity than the traditional
ﬁeld survey method. However, the use of acoustic sensors generates large volumes of audio
data, which makes it necessary to develop automated methods. This paper proposes a novel
method for detecting frog calling activity based on acoustic event detection and multi-label
learning. Speciﬁcally, acoustic event detection is the ﬁrst step to calculate frog abundance.
Meanwhile, each 10-second recording is analyzed to decide whether it has frog calls or not. For
those recordings with frog calls, multi-label learning is further used for calculating frog species
richness with multi-stage WP-based features and LPCs. Finally, statistic analysis is utilized to
reﬂect the relationship between frog calling activity (frog abundance and frog species richness)
and weather variables (mean temperature and rainfall). Experiment results show that our
proposed method can accurately detect frog calling activity and reﬂect its relationship with
weather variables. Future work will focus on a wider frog call database, including a larger
number of frog species, and frog calls collected over a longer period.
