Abstract In this paper we interpret the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm
(BMA) for synthesis of linear feedback shift register (LFSR) as an algorithm computing Pade approximants for Laurent series over arbitrary
ﬁeld. This interpretation of the BMA is based on a iterated procedure for
computing of the sequence of polynomials orthogonal to some sequence
of polynomial spaces with scalar product depending on the given Laurent
series. It is shown that the BMA is equivalent to the Euclidean algorithm
of a conversion of Laurent series in continued fractions.

Introduction

Let f0 , . . . , fn−1 , . . . be a sequence of elements from arbitrary given ﬁeld F. The
given sequence is generated by the given LFSR iﬀ this sequence satisﬁes the
m
linear recurrence relation of order m, i=0 fi+k qi = 0, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . with the
m
initial values f0 , . . . , fm−1 , where Q(x) = i=0 qi xi , qm = 1 is the characteristic
polynomial of the given LFSR. (see [1].) The reciprocal characteristic polynomial Q∗ (x) = xm Q(1/x) is called the feedback polynomial of the given LFSR.
Denote by Ln (f ) the least degree of the polynomial Λn generating the sequence
f0 , . . . , fn−1 . The number Ln (f ) is called the linear complexity of the sequences
f0 , . . . , fn−1 . ([1].) The sequence L1 (f ), . . . Ln (f ) is called the linear complexity
proﬁle of the sequence f0 , . . . , fn−1 . J. L. Massey [2] interpreted the Berlekamp
algorithm [3] as the algorithm computing of the linear complexity proﬁle for the
given sequence and generating the corresponding sequence of the characteristic
polynomials. ( see [1].) Berlekamp’s variant of the BMA is equivalent to the
variant of the Euclidean algorithm (EA) given for BCH codes decoding ([4].) In
[5], [6] was investigated connections between the BMA and continued fractions.

In [7] was given the matrix generalization of the BMA. This generalization was
used in [8] in the proof of the equivalence the BMA and the EA for decoding
of BCH codes. We interpret the BMA from the point of view of theory of Pade
approximants and orthogonal polynomials.

Pade Approximants for Laurent Series, Continued
Fractions, Linear Complexity, and BMA

Any expression z n (c0 + c1 /z + c2 /z 2 + . . . ), c0 = 0, with any integer n and
coeﬃcients ci ∈ F is called a formal Laurent series. The set F ((1/z)) of all
Laurent series forms the ﬁeld with respect to the sum and product operation
(see [9]). Any series f (z) with null integral part may be expanded in continued

The proper fraction formed the ﬁrst n levels of a given continued fraction, is
called a n−th convergent to a given continued fraction and is denoted by τn . The
numerator Pn and the denominator Qn of the τn are calculated by the recurrent
formulas Qn = an Qn−1 + Qn−2 , Q1 = 1, Q0 = 0, Pn = an Pn−1 + Pn−2 , P1 =
a1 , P0 = 1. (see [9].) The polynomials Qn and Pn have degrees sn − 1 and sn ,
where sn = d1 + . . . + dn , s0 = 0, dn = deg an . We consider only Laurent series

Theorem 2. LΠn +n = Πn .
If the degree of denominator of n−th Pade fraction is equal n, then the index n
is called normal. If n0 < n1 there are adjacent normal indexes, then ([9]) for any
k, n1 > k ≥ n0 , f (z)Gn0 (z) − Pn0 (z) = Gn0 (z)(cz −n0 −n1 + . . . ) = ez −n1 + . . . =
bz −k−1 + . . . , c, e, b ∈ F and Gk = Gn0 , n0 = Πn0 = Πk = Lk+Πk = Lk+n0 . The
sequence of normal indexes coincides with the sequence s0 , s1 , s2 , . . . and Pade
approximants πsn = τn = Pn /Qn . ([9].) Therefore, for any k, sn ≤ k < sn+1 , is
valid πk = πsn = τn , Gk = Gsn = Qn and for any sequence {f0 , . . . , fsn +k }, k =
sn − 1, . . . , sn+1 − 2 the minimal LFSR has the characteristic polynomial Qn .
Theorem 3. Lk+sn = sn , sn−1 ≤ k < sn .
From theorem 3 easy follows well known
Theorem 4. If the LFSR of the complexity Lk (f ) generates the sequence
f0 , . . . , fk then Lk+1 (f ) = Lk (f ), else Lk+1 (f ) = max{Lk (f ), k + 1 − Lk (f )}.

The Interpretation of the BMA in Terms of Orthogonal
Polynomials

The following part of the paper does not assume any knowledge about the BMA
and can be used for a alternative description of this algorithm.
Let P ol(n) be the space of polynomials of degree less than n over a ﬁeld F .
For the given sequence {f0 , . . . , fn−1 } over a ﬁeld F we consider the linear functional lf (P ) =

n−1
i=0

n−1

fi pi , P (z) =

i=0

pi z i . over the space P ol(n). On the space

P ol(n) may be deﬁned the scalar product (P, Q) = (P, Q)f of polynomials P, Q
by equality (P, Q) = lf (P Q). Obviously is valid the identity (P, Q) = (P Q, 1).
m
Following [9], we rewrite the equalities i=0 fi+k qi = 0, k = 0, . . . , s − 1, where
m
Q(z) = i=0 qi z i , qm = 1, as the equalities (Q(z), z k ) = 0, k = 0, . . . , s − 1,
where (P, Q) is the scalar product of polynomials P, Q. Orthogonality of vectors
is denoted by the symbol ⊥ . Therefore, the system of equalities (Qn (z), z k ) =
0, k = 0, . . . , sn − 1 is equivalent to the relation Qn (z) ⊥ P olsn . Hence
sn
Qn ⊥ Qn−1 and the sequence of polynomials Qn (z) = i=0
qn,i z i , is uniquely
determined by the mentioned above condition of the orthogonality.
Suppose that we have computed the polynomial Qn by the given sequence f0 , . . . , f2sn −1 . It is valid Λ2sn = Qn . Computing (Qn (z), z k ) =
m
i=0 fi+k qn,i , m = sn , k = m, m + 1, . . . we ﬁnd minimal k such that
(Qn (z), z k ) = 0. Hence, we can ﬁnd sn+1 , because k = sn+1 − 1. Since the
sn
fi+k qn,i = 0, k = 0, . . . , sn+1 − 2,
polynomial Qn (z) satisﬁes the condition i=0
then the LFSR with the characteristic polynomial Qn generates any sequence
f0 , . . . , fk , where k = 2sn , . . . , sn + sn+1 − 2. Therefore, we have Λk =
Qn , k = 2sn , . . . , sn + sn+1 − 1. Further, we ﬁnd dn+1 = sn+1 − sn . Let’s
look for the polynomial Qn+1 in the form an+1 (z)Qn (z) + Qn−1 (z), where
deg an+1 = dn+1 . The polynomial Qn+1 is uniquely determined (with an exactitude up to a constant factor) by the condition Qn+1 ⊥ P olsn+1 . By the

564

induction hypothesis Qn ⊥ P olsn+1 −1 , but the polynomial Qn is not orthogonal to the space P olsn+1 . Hence, (Qn (z), z sn+1 −1 ) = ∆sn +sn+1 −1 = 0. Since
an+1 (z)z k ∈ P olsn+1 −1 , z k ∈ P olsn −1 , we see that for any polynomial an+1
of degree dn+1 an+1 (z)Qn (z) + Qn−1 (z) ⊥ P olsn −1 . To choose the polynomial
an+1 such that the polynomial an+1 (z)Qn (z) + Qn−1 (z) is orthogonal to the
space generated by the monomials z sn −1 , . . . , z sn+1 −1 , we need next condition.
The projections of the polynomials an+1 (z)Qn (z) and Qn−1 (z) on this space are
opposite, i.e. (an+1 (z)Qn (z), z k ) = −(Qn−1 (z), z k ), k = sn − 1, . . . , sn+1 − 1.
These equalities concerning coeﬃcients of the polynomial an+1 determine the
system of linear equations with a triangular matrix. This system may be solved
by the following iterated algorithm.
(i−1)
A step with any number. At i−th step we correct the polynomial Qn+1
(i−1)
(i)
iﬀ ∆sn +sn+1 +i−2 = (Qn+1 , z sn +i−2 ) = 0. Then we look for the Qn+1 =
(i−1)
(i)
Qn+1 + cQn z dn+1 −i+1 such that Qn+1 ⊥ z sn +i−2 . For this goal we search
(i−1)
a constant c such that the projections Qn+1 , cQn z dn+1 −i+1 on the monomial z sn +i−2 are opposite. Hence, c = −∆sn +sn+1 +i−2 /∆sn +sn+1 −1 . Since
(i−1)
(i−1)
Qn+1 ⊥ P olsn +i−2 by the induction hypothesis, we have Qn+1 ⊥ z sn +k

for any k, −1

i − 3. Therefore, (Qn+1 , z sn +k ) = (Qn+1 , z sn +k ) +
(i)
(cQn z dn+1 −i+1 , z sn +k ) = c(Qn , z sn+1 +k+1−i ) = 0. Since Qn+1 ⊥ P olsn +i−1 , we
(i)
see that Λsn +sn+1 +i−2 = Qn+1 . Last step. Finally, at dn+1 + 1−th step we
(d

that
⊥ P olsn +dn+1 = P olsn+1 . This polynomial coincides with the
polynomial Qn+1 . Hence Λ2sn+1 = Qn+1 .
