Abstract
Optimization is an important tool in computational ﬁnance and business intelligence. Multiple criteria mathematical program(MCMP), which is concerned with mathematical optimization problems involving more than one objective function to
be optimized simultaneously, is one of the ways of utilizing optimization techniques. Due to the existence of multiple objectives, MCMPs are usually diﬃcult to be optimized. In fact, for a nontrivial MCMP, there does not exist a single solution that
optimizes all the objectives at the same time. In practice, many methods convert the original MCMP into a single-objective
program and solve the obtained scalarized optimization problem. If the values of scalarization parameters, which measure
the trade-oﬀs between the conﬂicting objectives, are not chosen carefully, the converted single-objective optimization problem
may be not solvable. Therefore, to make sure MCMP always can be solved successfully, heuristic search and expert knowledge
for deciding the value of scalarization parameters are always necessary, which is not an easy task and limits the applications
of MCMP to some extend. In this paper, we take the multiple criteria linear program(MCLP) for binary classiﬁcation as the
example and discuss how to modiﬁed the formulation of MCLP directly to guarantee the solvability. In details, we propose
adding a quadratic regularization term into the converted single-objective linear program. The new regularized formulation
does not only overcomes some defects of the original scalarized problem in modeling, it also can be shown in theory that the
ﬁnite optimal solutions always exist. To test the performance of the proposed method, we compare our algorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms for binary classiﬁcation on several diﬀerent kinds of datasets. Preliminary experimental results
demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our regularization method.

1. Introduction
Optimization techniques, such as modeling and algorithm design, are playing an important and ever increasing
role in lots of disciplines related with computational sciences. In the machine learning and data mining area, the
utilization of optimization techniques can go back to more than half a century ago. In 1957, A. Charnes and W.
W. Cooper discussed the using of linear programming models as guides to data collection and data analyisis[1]. In
1960’s, J. B. Rosen showed that the pattern separation problem can be formulated and solved as a convex programming problem and linear and nonlinear ellipsoidal separation may be achieved by nonlinear programming in [2];

O. L. Mangasarian then showed that both linear and nonlinear separation may be achieved by linear programming
in [3]. From the end of 1970’s to 1980’s, N. Feed and F. Glover proposed a series of linear programming models
for discriminant problems [4, 5]. Since 1992, V.N. Vapnik and his colleagues proposed the concept of Support
Vector Machine(SVM)[6, 7], which is a quadratic program model developed from statistical learning theory[8, 9].
Nowadays, SVM has become one of the most powerful machine-learning technique and gains lots of attention
because of its excellent performance empirically. With the popularization of SVMs and the development of optimization itself, the researchers have extensively applied optimization techniques into machine learning and data
mining[10, 11].
Diﬀerent from all the research works mentioned above, which are all modeled as a single-objective optimization, Y. Shi and his research group started trying to apply the techniques of multiple-objective optimization
techniques into the area of data analysis and data mining since 1998. A series of multiple criteria mathematical program(MCMP) models, including multiple criteria linear program(MCLP) and multiple criteria quadratic
program(MCQP), are proposed since then(see [12, 13] and references therein). Nowadays, MCMP has become
one of the popular ways of utilizing optimization techniques to handle the real world data mining problems from
computational ﬁnance and business intelligence[14, 15, 16, 17].
On one hand, with the introduction of multiple objectives, MCMP has more powerful modeling capabilities
than the single-objective program; On the other hand, MCMPs are always diﬃcult to be optimized than the optimization problem with only on objective function. For a nontrivial MCMP, there does not exist a single solution
that optimizes all the objectives at the same time. In fact, because the multiple goals are usually contradictory
with each other, giving the proper deﬁnition of optimal solution in MCMP is not an easy task itself. Although
the propositions of many concepts, such as Pareto optimality and compromise solution[18], indeed help people a
lot to understand the structure of the solutions of MCMP in theory, the algorithms for ﬁnding the Pareto optimal
solutions or compromise solutions directly are always time consuming and impractical for large scale problems.
Currently, many methods convert the original MCLP into a single-objective program and solve the obtained scalarized optimization problem. For this kind of methodologies, the choice for the values of scalarization parameters
is critical. If the values of scalarization parameters, which measure the trade-oﬀs between the conﬂicting objectives, are not chosen carefully, the converted single-objective optimization problem may be not solvable. How
to guarantee the solvability of the scalarized optimizations becomes a very worthy study problem. However, the
researches in this area is just in its infancy. To the best of our knowledge, there is only a limited works discussing
how to make sure the converted single-objective optimizations have solutions. In [16], the authors proposed a
regularized formulation for the MCLP model in classiﬁcation, which is a feasible and bounded-below quadratic
programming. For most of the existing works of applying MCMP[12, 13, 14, 15, 17] in data mining, to make
sure MCMPs always can be solved successfully in practice, heuristic search and expert knowledge for deciding
the value of scalarization parameters are always necessary[14, 15, 17], which is not an easy task and limits the
applications of MCMP to some extend. In this work, diﬀerent from the methodology in [16], we propose a new
and simpler regularization way for the MCLP model of binary classiﬁcation. The new regularized formulation
does not only overcomes some defects of the original scalarized problem in modeling, it also can be shown in
theory that the ﬁnite optimal solutions always exist.
The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we ﬁrst review the basic model of MCLP
for binary classiﬁcation and the traditional way of converting MCLP into a scalarized optimization problem. Then
the properties of the converted single-objective linear program are analyzed carefully. Based on these discussions,
we propose our new regularization formulation, which can be guaranteed to be always solvable for all the possible
choices of parameters. Some geometric interpretations of the model and theoretical analysis on the solvability are
also given at the same time. In Section 3, to test the eﬀectiveness of the new regularized model, we evaluate the
new method empirically and reported the experimental results obtained. We draw the conclusion and state some
future works in the last section. A few words about the notations used in this paper. All vectors will be column
vectors unless transposed to a row vector by a superscript T . The column vector of zeros of arbitrary dimension
will be denoted by 0 and the column vector of ones of arbitrary dimension will be denoted by e. The capital
English letters are used to denote matrixes, especially, the identity matrix of arbitrary dimension will be denoted
by I.

2. The New Regularized MCLP Model for Binary Classiﬁcation
2.1. Modelling Binary Classiﬁcation as the MCLP
Let S = {(x1 , y1 ), ..., (x , y )} be a set of training samples belonging to diﬀerent categories, where xi ∈ X ⊆ n
and yi ∈ Y are the input data and corresponding label for the sample i, respectively. The goal of a classiﬁcation
problem is to construct a classiﬁer which, given a new data point, will correctly predict the class to which the new
point belongs. When there are two elements in Y, the problem is called binary classiﬁcation; When there are more
than two elements in Y, it is called multiclass classiﬁcation. We consider the problem of binary classiﬁcation in
this work and let Y = {±1} for the rest of this paper. Introducing variables w ∈ n , b ∈ , and ξ, β ∈
, the
basic MCLP for binary classiﬁcation [12] can be presented in the following way:
min

i=1 ξi

(1a)

max

i=1

βi

(1b)

w,b,ξ,β
w,b,ξ,β

s.t.

yi (xiT w + b) = βi − ξi , i = 1, · · · , ;
ξi ≥ 0,
βi ≥ 0,
i = 1··· , ;

(1c)
(1d)

Here w and b can be considered as the slope and intercept of the separating hyperplane, respectively. For the
intuitive explanations of ξ and β, diﬀerent from previous works [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17], we would like to interpreted
ξi as the a positive value which is proportional to the distance between the point xi and the half-hyperplane
yi (xT w + b) > 0, and βi as the a positive value which is proportional to the distance between the point xi and the
half-hyperplane yi (xiT w + b) < 0, for any i = 1, · · · , . Then i=1 ξi can be considered as the measurement for
misclassiﬁcation and li=1 βi can be considered as a measurement for the generalization of the separating plane.
Just as we have mentioned in the ﬁrst section of this paper, because the existing conﬂicting goals of max i=1 βi
and min i=1 ξi , there usually does not exist a single solution that can optimize both objectives at the same time.
In theory, the concept of compromise solution[18] is proposed to describe and analyze the solution of MCLP
(1). However, in practice, the algorithms of ﬁnding the compromise solutions directly are always much more time
consuming than the algorithms for the same scale single objective problems, and, therefore, are not suitable for
dealing with large-scale data. Therefore, instead of solving MCLP (1) directly, many methods convert (1) into to
the following scalaried single-objective linear program(LP):
min

w,b,ξ,β

s.t.

i=1 ξi

−γ

i=1

βi

yi (xiT w + b) = βi − ξi , i = 1, · · · , ;
ξi ≥ 0,
βi ≥ 0,
i = 1··· , .

(2a)
(2b)
(2c)

where γ > 0 is the scalarization parameter, which balances the trade-oﬀs between max i=1 βi and min li=1 ξi .
Obviously, if one would like to ﬁnd a reasonable solution of MCLP (1) by solving LP (2), one of the basic
requirements is that LP (2) has at least a ﬁnite optimal solution. Then whether LP (2) is always solvable becomes
a natural question need to be answered. For a better understanding of the structure of problem (2), we will ﬁrst
analyze the properties of this LP in the next subsection.
2.2. Properties of the Scalarized LP
For any given LP, there are only three diﬀerent kind of cases could happen: Case I. The problem has a ﬁnite
optimal solution; Case II. The problem is unbounded; Case III. The problem is infeasible. The following lemma
tell us that for the special LP (2), Case III never happens.
Lemma 2.1. The feasible set of LP (2) is not empty.
. It can be easily checked that zero point (wT , b, ξT , βT )T
Proof. Let w = 0 ∈ n , b = 0 ∈ , ξ = β = 0 ∈
satisﬁes all the constraints in LP (2). i.e. the zero vector 0 is always a feasible point of LP (2).
In order to get a separating plane by solving LP (2), only guaranteeing the existence of feasible points is not
enough. A ﬁnite optimal solution of LP(2) is always required. The following lemma tells us with improper choice
of the scalarization parameter γ, LP (2) may be unbounded.

1693

Lemma 2.2. When parameter γ > 1, LP (2) is unbounded.
Proof. From Lemma 2.1, we already know that LP (2) always has a feasible point. Suppose (wT , b, ξT , βT )T
is a feasible point of (2), then for all δ > 0, (wT , b, ξT + δeT , βT + δeT ) is also a feasible point of (2) and the
corresponding value of objective function is
l

(ξi + δ) − γ
i=1

(βi + δ) = (
i=1

ξi − γ
i=1

βi ) + (1 − γ)δ.
i=1

Because γ > 1, (1 − γ) < 0. Then we can see that with δ goes up to +∞, (1 − γ)δ goes to −∞. Consequently, the
value of the objective function in (2) goes to the negative inﬁnity. Therefore, LP (2) is unbounded.
From the above lemma, we know the positive parameter γ ≤ 1 is a necessary condition for the problem
(2) has a ﬁnite optimal solution. In fact, if we check the intuitive explanations of the model, this conclusion is
not totally unexpected. Recall that γ measures the weight between the goals of less misclassiﬁcation and better
generalization. Obviously, talking about the generalization ability of a separating plane is only reasonable when it
can classify the samples in the training dataset S reasonably well. This means the weight assigned to minimizing
misclassiﬁcation should be higher than the weight assigned to maximizing generalization, i.e. the value of γ should
be no greater than one. Now our nature question is that “Is γ ≤ 1 also a suﬃcient condition for the solvability of
LP (2)?”. If the answer is no. How we can modiﬁed the formulation of (2) to get a revised model whose solvability
can be guaranteed.
From Lemma 2.1, we already know that the feasible set of LP (2) is no empty. Then only two situations
can happen: The ﬁrst is that for any feasible point in the feasible set of (2), the corresponding objective function
value is nonnegative; The second is that there is at least one feasible point of problem (2), whose corresponding
objective function value is negative. Now we discuss what will happen for the second situation.
Lemma 2.3. Suppose there is a point in the feasible set of LP (2), whose corresponding objective function value
is negative. Then LP (2) must be unbounded.
ˆ ξˆT , βˆ T )T satisfying
Proof. From the assumption of this lemma, for LP (2), there must be a feasible point (wˆ T , b,

is still a feasible point. Since i=1 tξi − γ i=1 tβi = t( i=1 ξi − γ i=1 βi ) goes to negative inﬁnity as t goes to the
positive inﬁnity, we obtain that LP (2) is unbounded.
Just as we have mentioned in the previous subsection, in order to obtain a separating plane, LP (2) must have
a ﬁnite optimal solution. So obviously the situation described in the above lemma is not the one we expected to
occur. However, it occurs frequently in practice. The following example tells us, at least for the totally separable
problems, a feasible solution with negative objective function always can be constructed.
Example 2.4. Consider the totally separable binary classiﬁcation problem described in Figure 1. Here, ⊕ represents the samples in one category, and ⊗ represents the samples in the other category. We choose the solid line in

¯ ≥ 0, let
can be decided and we denote the values as w¯ and b,
i
¯ if yi (xT w¯ + b)
¯ < 0, let β¯ i = 0 and ξ¯i = −yi (xT w¯ + b).

¯ξi = 0 and β¯i = yi (xT w¯ + b);

(w¯ T , b,
LP (2). Since this is a totally separable problem, for all i = 1, · · · , , we have ξ¯i = 0 and β¯ i > 0, a feasible point
with the negative function value is then constructed.
Summarizing the discussion above, we can see that for the totally separable problem, for any value of γ > 0,
LP (2) is unbounded, i.e. LP (2) is always unsolvable. Unfortunately, this is not the only unwanted situation we
might meet. The following example demonstrates another fetal defect of solving MCLP (1) by LP (2).
Example 2.5. Consider again the classiﬁcation problem depicted in Figure 1. The solid line in the middle of the
ﬁgure, the dash line in the left hand and the dash-dot line in the right hand are all separating planes. And obviously, the solid line in the middle is the best separating plane one can ﬁnd. Following the constructive way in Example
¯ ξ¯T , β¯ T )T , the feasible point corresponds to the
2.4, denote the feasible point corresponds to the solid line as (wT , b,
T ´ ´T ´ T T
` ξ`T , β` T )T .1 Though
dash line as (w , b, ξ , β ) , and the feasible point corresponds to the dash-dot line as (wT , b,
simple computations, we can see that the objective function value of LP (2) for these three diﬀerent points are the
¯ ξ¯T , β¯ T )T is the optimal solution of LP (2), so are the points (wT , b,
´ ξ´T , β´ T )T and
same. This means that if (wT , b,
T ` `T ` T T
(w , b, ξ , β ) . Then according to LP (2), all three separating planes are the best separating plane, which is,
obviously, not the result we want to get.
In all, we can see that LP (2) is not a good model for the totally separable classiﬁcation problem. Since the
totally separable case is the ideal and the simplest situation in classiﬁcation, in order to apply LP (2) successfully,
we have to make some modiﬁcation.
2.3. New Regularized MCLP Model for Binary Classiﬁcation
Just as we have discussed in the above subsection, LP (2) might be unsolvable. In the exiting works for solving
MCLP by LP (2)[12, 13, 14, 15, 17], this trap is avoided by pre-setting the value of part of the variables in LP
(2). However, if the chosen value are not proper, even LP (2) can be solved, the separating plane obtained may
still not be a good separating plane. From this point of view, the choice for the value of the pre-setting variables is
very important. Heuristic search and expert knowledge are always necessary for deciding a good value, which is
timing consuming and limits the applications of MCMP to some extend. So in this paper, we would like provide
a new method to guarantee the solvability instead of the way of ﬁxing the value of part of the variables.
In order to avoid the diﬃculty described in Example 2.5, we suggest adding a regularization term 12 βT Hβ into
the objective function of (2), where H is a × positive matrix. Then we obtain the following modiﬁed formulation
for the LP (2), which is a quadratic programming:
min

w,b,ξ,β

s.t.

i=1 ξi

yi (xiT w + b) = βi − ξi , i = 1, · · · , ;
ξi ≥ 0,
βi ≥ 0,
i = 1··· , ;

(3b)
(3c)

where τ > 0 is a pre-given parameter. The following theorem shows that the solvability of the modiﬁed problem
(3) is guaranteed.
Theorem 2.6. Problem (3) always has a feasible solution.

Proof. Because H is positive deﬁnite, for all β ∈

Because ξ ≥ 0, we have that i=1 ξi ≥ 0. In all, we know for problem (3), the objective function has a lower

e H e. We notice that the feasible set of LP (2) is the same as quadratic program (3, from Lemma 2.1
bound − 2τ
we know that the feasible set of problem (3) is nonempty. In all, we obtained the conclusion that the optimization
problem (3) always has a feasible solution.

1 The

reason for the w terms for three diﬀerent points are the same is that three diﬀerent separating planes possess the same slope.

Lingfeng Niu et al. / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 1690 – 1699

1695

Consider again the example in Figure 1. Let H = I, it can be easily checked that for (model 3), only the solid
line in the middle corresponds to the optimal solution and the situation described in Example 2.5 does not happen.
Compared with the regularized MCLP proposed in [16], in (3), there is only one quadratic regularization term in
the objective function. So fewer regularization parameter and matrix need to be tuned in our modiﬁed formulation
and, therefore, our method is cheaper to be implemented in practice.
Although problem (3) always has ﬁnite optimal solutions, there is still an defect from the modeling point of
view. In details, we notice that
xT w + b = 0 and txT + tb = 0, for all t > 0
presents the same discriminant function and therefore, the same separating plane. However, the objective function
value of (3) corresponds to txT + tb = 0 diﬀers with the value of t > 0, which is obviously should not occur. As
a remedy to this problem, we should require that the slope-intercept expression of each discriminant function is
unique in the model. This requirement can be easily implemented by choosing the value of intercept term b from
the set {1, 0, −1}. Then we get the following model of mixed integer nonlinear programming:
l
i=1 ξi

min

w,b,ξ,β

s.t.

−γ

l
i=1

βi + 12 τβT Hβ

yi (xiT w + b) = βi − ξi , i = 1, · · · , ;
ξi ≥ 0,
βi ≥ 0,
i = 1··· , ;
b ∈ {−1, 1, 0}.

(4a)
(4b)
(4c)
(4d)

We observe that if xT w∗ = 0 is the best separating plane, where the value of | | is small enough, xT w∗ + = 0 is
also a good enough separating plane. Since as long as the intercept term is not zero, it is always can be normalized
to 1 or -1. To reduce the computational cost further, we can omitted the case of b = 0 from (4) and suggest users
apply the following simpliﬁed model in practice:
l
i=1 ξi

min

w,b,ξ,β

s.t.

−γ

l
i=1

βi + 12 τβT Hβ

yi (xiT w + b) = βi − ξi , i = 1, · · · , ;
ξi ≥ 0,
βi ≥ 0,
i = 1··· , ;
b ∈ {−1, 1}.

(5a)
(5b)
(5c)
(5d)

Sometimes, considering the stability of calculations, the users may favor the separating plane whose elements in
slope is not too large. To this aim. the regularization term κwT Kw can be added to the objective function to limit
the value of the elements in w. Then the following model can be considered instead of (5):
min

w,b,ξ,β

s.t.

l
i=1 ξi

−γ

l
i=1

βi + 12 τβT Hβ + 12 κwT Kw

yi (xiT w + b) = βi − ξi , i = 1, · · · , ;
ξi ≥ 0,
βi ≥ 0,
i = 1··· , ;
b ∈ {−1, 1},

(6a)
(6b)
(6c)
(6d)

where κ > 0 and positive matrix K ∈ n×n are pre-given model parameters. Similar to the proof in Theorem 2.6,
we can easily proved that the solvability of both model (5) and (6) can be guaranteed.
3. Experiments
To test the performance of the new method, we compared our algorithm with several state-of-the-art algorithms
for binary classiﬁcation in this section. All experiment were executed on a computer with Intel I5 CPU, CPU clock
rate of 3.10GHz, 2 GB main memory. The method proposed in this paper are solved by CVX[19, 20], which is a
Matlab-based modeling system for convex optimization. CVX are described using a limited set of construction
rules, which enables them to be analyzed and solved eﬃciently. As for the implementation for other algorithms,

1696

SVM were applied with libSVM[21] which is an powerful software for both support vector classiﬁcation and
regression; Other typical methods were implemented through Weka [22] platform, which is an excellent data
mining environment that integrates various of machine learning algorithms under a uniform platform.
The datasets in our experiment are all from the UCI Machine Learning Repository [23]. Most of them are
wildly used for machine learning research in the validation and comparison among classiﬁcation algorithms. For
each dataset, we ﬁrst discarded the instances with missing value. And then, grid search were adopted to selecting
proper parameters for each method. Search procedure were executed under an uniform settings. During searching
we chose 5 fold cross-validation for each group of parameters. That is to say, for each parameters group candidate,
classiﬁcation accuracy was obtained once by running a 5-fold cross validation on a speciﬁc dataset. After all, we
chose the best accuracy as the performance of the method on that dataset. Several classical binary classiﬁcation
algorithms were chosen for comparison including linear SVC [8], Naive Bayes [24], C45 [25], Random Forest [26]
and KNN [27]. The experimental results were showed in Table 1. Here, the column “RMCLP1” and “RMCLP2”
represents the results for the model (5) and (6), respectively.

In order to validate how our algorithm works in separable cases, we turned two simple datasets ‘iris’ and ‘wine’
into binary classiﬁcation problems by having two of their original categories left. In general, good classiﬁers
should almost make this kind of datasets completely divided. Experiment results are illustrated in Figure 2. In
details, the leftmost two bars in Figure 2 representing the performance of our method, from which we can see that
separable data indeed can be identiﬁed and well treated by our regularization method. By comparing with other
ﬁve bars in the ﬁgure, we can ﬁnd that our method perform as well as other classical algorithms.
Then we compare our regularized model with the state-of-the-art algorithms in the non-separable cases. The
results in ﬁgure 3 and 4 show that our method is still competitive with other algorithms confronting more complex
situation. Especially, for the datasets ‘credit-a’, ‘credit-g’ and ‘heart-statlog’, our method obtains the highest
classiﬁcation accuracy among all the algorithms. One of the possible reason for this result is that in these three
datasets, there is linear relationship among some features of the samples, and our method can explore this kind of
linear correlation better than other methods. Furthermore, The results on the diﬀerent types of data also illustrate
the stability of our method.
4. Conclusion and future work
MCLP, as an alternative method for classiﬁcation and regression, has been widely used in various machine
learning and data mining problems. In order to apply MCLP eﬃciently in practice, many methods convert the

original MCLP into a single-objective linear program to solve. However, the solvability of the converted singleobjective optimization is not very clear. In this paper, we take the MCLP for binary classiﬁcation as the example
and discuss how to modiﬁed the formulation of converted single-objective optimization to guarantee the solvability. By ﬁxing the value of intercept of the separating plane to {±1}, the new model overcomes some defects of the
original scalarized problem in modeling; By adding a quadratic regularization term into the objective function,
the new regularized formulation can be shown that the ﬁnite optimal solutions always exist. We compare the
new method with several state-of-the-art algorithms for binary classiﬁcation on several diﬀerent kinds of datasets.
Preliminary experimental results indeed demonstrate the eﬀectiveness of our method.
The model proposed in this paper is restricted to the case with linear kernel. Although we know linear classiﬁer
is a good choice for lots of practical applications, especially for those whose dimension of the input feature is
very high. There are still quite a few problems cannot be predicted accurately by linear functions. Therefore,
in order to exploit the ﬂexibility of nonlinear separating surfaces, we plan to extend the model to the case with
nonlinear kernels, which is interesting and very changeable. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing work
for regularized MCLP with nonlinear classiﬁers currently. In this paper, we only considered the case of binary
classiﬁcation in this paper. How to apply the idea to more general cases, such as multi-category classiﬁcation or
regression, is also one of our on ongoing works.
