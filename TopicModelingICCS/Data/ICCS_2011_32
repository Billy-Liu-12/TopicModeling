Abstract
We present an immersed boundary method based on volume penalization, with which pulsatile ﬂow in a model
cerebral aneurysm is simulated. The model aneurysm consists of a curved vessel merged with a spherical cavity. The
dominant vortical structures arising in the time-dependent ﬂow are discussed and the evolution of the maximal shear
stress in the aneurysm is analyzed. We approximate ﬂow properties of blood by those of an incompressible Newtonian
ﬂuid. The ﬂow inside the aneurysm is simulated with the use of a skew-symmetric ﬁnite-volume discretization and
explicit time-stepping. We focus on eﬀects due to variations in the amplitude of the pulsatile ﬂow as well as due to
changes in the Reynolds number (Re) by studying ﬂow at Re = 100, 250 and 500. At Re = 500 a complex timedependence in the shear stress levels is observed, reﬂecting the lively development of the ﬂow in the model aneurysm
in which vortices are created continuously inside the curved vessel and in the spherical cavity of the aneurysm. An
increase in the amplitude of the pulsatile ﬂow increases the shear stress levels somewhat, but at Re = 500 the ﬂow is
mainly dominated by its intrinsic unsteadiness. Reducing the Reynolds number yields a stronger contribution of the
periodic pulsatile ﬂow forcing: at Re = 100 we ﬁnd a strong dominance of shear stress levels due to the forcing, while
at Re = 250 the intrinsic and pulsatile unsteadiness are of comparable importance.

1. Introduction
There is a growing medical need to obtain predictions of the ﬂow behavior and shear stresses inside the human
brain that is speciﬁc to individual patients. The prediction of the ﬂow constitutes a challenging and timely computational multiscale modeling problem, aimed at understanding and identifying the likelihood of long-time rupture from
an analysis of short-time pulsatile ﬂow [13]. Understanding such pulsatile ﬂow patterns will help to describe longtime accumulation eﬀects such as the growth of an aneurysm, or the deterioration of the vessel wall due to reduced
blood circulation. This capability allows also a more complete planning of surgical intervention and can be used to
predict the eﬀectiveness of such procedures. A huge amount of work has been done on Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD) of ﬂow in the human brain and in the cardiovascular system [11, 2, 1, 12, 6, 3]. The most commonly adopted
numerical approach is the ﬁnite element method. This method can, in principle, represent highly complex geometries but at considerable expense, particularly when dealing with raw biomedical imagery to deﬁne vessel geometries

2. Numerical method
In this section we introduce the ﬂuid-mechanical model that is used to simulate blood ﬂow in cerebral aneurysms.
The numerical method employs a volume-penalization immersed boundary (IB) method, which is brieﬂy reviewed
and illustrated for the geometry of a curved blood vessel. For viscous ﬂow at Reynolds number Re = 1 we present
convergence ﬁndings achieved by grid reﬁnement.
There is a number of diﬀerent approaches to model ﬂow of blood in the human brain. A comprehensive overview
is given in [12]. One way is to approximate blood as a simple Newtonian ﬂuid with constant viscosity [2]. More
reﬁned models include the shear-thinning behavior of blood by adopting, e.g., the Carreau-Yasuda model to capture
non-Newtonian rheology [1, 6]. Under physiological ﬂow conditions in suﬃciently large arteries the non-Newtonian
corrections were found to be quite small [11, 3]. The main ﬂow features were the same as in Newtonian ﬂow,
albeit at somewhat diﬀerent stress and velocity levels. In this paper we study to what extent an immersed boundary
method is suitable to simulate time-dependent ﬂow in the circle of Willis; for these low Reynolds ﬂows in larger
cerebral vessels non-Newtonian corrections are neglected. Hence, we restrict to incompressible Newtonian ﬂuid
mechanics as represented by the Navier-Stokes equations. The total physical domain Ω consists of a ﬂuid part Ω f and
a complementary solid part Ω s . The interface between the two will be identiﬁed as ∂Ω f at which the no-slip condition
applies. The governing equations, completed with a no-slip boundary condition on the solid walls of the domain are
given in non-dimensional form by:
1 2
∂u
+ u · ∇u = −∇p +
∇ u+f
∂t
Re
∇·u = 0
with u = 0 at ∂Ω f

where u is the velocity of the ﬂuid in the domain Ω, p is the pressure and Re = UL/ν is the Reynolds number, in terms
of a reference velocity U, a reference length scale L and the kinematic viscosity ν = μ/ρ with molecular viscosity
given by μ and the ﬂuid mass density ρ. In our model the length scale is of the order of the diameter of a vessel
connecting to an aneurysm cavity, while the reference velocity is of the order of the bulk velocity derived from the
mass ﬂow-rate Q and the cross-sectional area of a vessel A, i.e., U = Q/A. Obviously, the velocity inside the solid
regions should vanish. This may be expressed to very close approximation by a proper selection of the forcing term f
giving rise to a volume penalization immersed boundary method [10]. We describe this approach in more detail next.
The IB method provides an alternative to conventional numerical simulation methods in case ﬂow in and around
very complex spatial domains is considered. Conventional methods adhere to computational meshes that are bodyﬁtted. With this approach the gridding of the ﬂuid region becomes very time consuming for complex domains. The
task of generating grids that yield an accurate discrete computational model is correspondingly diﬃcult, up to the
point of becoming impractical. Instead, the IB method can be formulated entirely in terms of an uniform Cartesian
grid. The geometry over and through which the ﬂow takes place is simply immersed in a ‘block’ of physical space.
These striking diﬀerences in the computational strategies also imply important consequences for the accuracy with
which ﬂow near solid boundaries may generally be captured. Conventional body-ﬁtted methods allow, in principle,
for a precise representation of no-slip conditions at the body. In contrast, the accuracy achieved by an IB method
generally is reduced by the fact that the geometry is not aligned with the Cartesian grid and the location of the solidﬂuid interface is known only to within a grid-spacing. The accuracy of the resulting IB method will be considered
for the velocity ﬁeld u as well as its gradient, e.g., in terms of the shear stresses that develop. As illustrated in [8]
reliable results can readily be obtained at moderate Reynolds numbers, even with the coarse staircase approach to the
solid-ﬂuid interface.
The forcing term f in our IB method represents the impenetrability of a stationary solid wall to ﬂuid ﬂow. It is
approximated by direct penalization of the ﬂow from entering the solid domain by choosing

The control parameter ε

[2, 6, 3]. As an alternative approach, designed primarily to treat ﬂow in domains of realistic complexity, we present
the development and application of an immersed boundary (IB) method capable to reliably compute ﬂow and shear
stresses at various ﬂow conditions and vessel geometries. We concentrate on a generic model aneurysm with which
the ﬂow and forces are studied at a range of physiologically relevant Reynolds numbers and various amplitudes of the
pulsatile ﬂow. The eﬀects of the pulsatile ﬂow are found to be strongest for very viscous ﬂow, i.e., at relatively low
Reynolds numbers, while the intrinsic unsteadiness of the ﬂow at higher Reynolds numbers is dominant.
In medical applications the shape of cerebral aneurysms developing in patients can be inferred by using threedimensional rotational angiography [4]. In this procedure a small volume of brain tissue can be scanned, allowing an
approximate identiﬁcation of the ﬂuid and the solid parts. A volume-penalization immersed boundary (IB) method
is applied to represent the aneurysm geometry. In this IB approach the ﬂow domain is characterized by a so-called
‘masking function’, which takes the value ‘0’ in a ﬂuid part and ‘1’ in solid parts of the domain. The raw angiography
data allows for a simple ‘staircase approximation’ of the vessel and aneurysm shape in which individual pixels in
the digital data form the smallest unit of localization of the solid-ﬂuid interface. This raw information speciﬁes
the masking function. We will adopt the ‘staircase’ geometry representation in this paper and do not incorporate
any additional smoothing of the geometry or the use of sophisticated reconstruction methods. For a more complete
modeling of the dynamics in the vessel system, ﬂow-structure interaction often plays a role [12]. In that case also
parameters and models that characterize mechanical elasticity of brain tissue are required. In this paper we restrict to
developing the IB approach for relatively small cerebral aneurysms for which movements of the vessel wall is often
not a primary concern and, hence, a detailed mechanical characterization is not required.
Cerebral aneurysms are most often located in the Circle of Willis – the central vessel network for the supply of
blood to the human brain. The common risk-areas are at ‘T’ and ‘Y’-shaped junctions in the vessels of the Circle of
Willis [5]. This motivates to analyze the ﬂow in basic vessel and aneurysm structures by modeling them as curved
cylindrical tubes to which spherical cavities are attached. The computational model for the simulation of blood ﬂow
through the larger vessels in the human brain is based on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The ﬂow
inside the vessels is simulated with a skew-symmetric ﬁnite-volume discretization on a uniform Cartesian grid and
explicit time-stepping. In this paper we illustrate our IB approach by predicting unsteady ﬂow in basic cylindrical
and spherical geometries. This allows a detailed assessment of the quality of the ﬂow predictions and forms essential
stepping stone problems on the way toward adopting the IB ﬂow solver on a patient-speciﬁc basis.
The quality of the predictions depends strongly on the spatial resolution that can be aﬀorded. From a previous
study of Poiseuille ﬂow in channels and pipes [9, 8] we inferred that about 16 grid points per coordinate direction
suﬃce to obtain reliable laminar ﬂow predictions. For general geometries that are not aligned with the underlying
Cartesian grid, ﬁrst order convergence upon grid-reﬁnement was established. Using an energy-conserving skewsymmetric discretization [14] the IB approach was found to provide reliable information about the ﬂow structure and
associated stress levels. Such computational modeling augments current clinical data and can, in future, help improve
the planning and execution of surgical interventions.
In [8] several strategies to generate a masking function were compared. For the test-case of Poiseuille ﬂow, the
analysis of the numerical method showed an overall ﬁrst order convergence. This low convergence order is associated
with the non-alignment of the geometry with the underlying Cartesian grid. Flow emerging from steady forcing was
investigated and the laminar velocity and shear stress distribution were computed. In this paper we focus on pulsatile
ﬂow through a model aneurysm, i.e., we investigate the ﬂow response to a time-dependent, prescribed mass ﬂow rate.
For convenience we impose a sinusoidal function for variations in the mass ﬂow rate and investigate eﬀects arising
from changes in the pulsatile amplitude at various Reynolds numbers, taken in the range 100-500 to comply with
clinical data in [7, 12]. The IB method in combination with skew-symmetric ﬁnite volume discretization was found
suitable to capture the dominant ﬂow structures and the corresponding time-dependent shear stresses on the aneurysm
walls. At suﬃciently low Reynolds number, e.g., at suﬃciently low ﬂuid velocity or at suﬃciently high viscosity,
the eﬀect of periodic variation in the mass ﬂow rate dominates the developing ﬂow. Conversely, at higher Reynolds
numbers the ﬂow displays an intrinsic unsteadiness associated with the nonlinearity in the Navier-Stokes equations,
which is strong enough to overwhelm the detailed periodic variations in the ﬂow rate.
The organization of this paper is as follows. In Section 2 we present a brief sketch of the IB method that is applied
to the curved vessel geometry and discuss the convergence of numerical predictions. The dynamics of pulsatile ﬂow
is discussed in Section 3 and an analysis of shear stress levels in pulsatile ﬂow is given in Section 4. Concluding
remarks are in Section 5.

part Ω f the masking function H(x) = 0. Correspondingly, around such a location the regular Navier-Stokes system in
(1)-(2) is employed. For any location inside the solid part Ω s of the domain the masking function H takes the value
1. Since ε is chosen very small, the forcing inside the solid domain dominates all other ﬂuxes in the Navier-Stokes
equations.
The form of the forcing f inside the solid part implies that the velocity component u is negligible; if at some
location in the solid u would, for some reason, have become non-zero then the forcing drives the local velocity
exponentially quickly back to negligible values. In the region near the interface between the solid and the ﬂuid parts
of the domain the velocity ﬁeld would be forced to negligible values within a very thin strip of the grid. A suﬃciently
small value of ε will imply a very localized region in which a non-trivial ﬂow in Ω f connects to a solution with
negligible values in Ω s . This rough sketch identiﬁes that the simple volume forcing (4) can indeed approximate a noslip boundary condition, localized to within one grid cell. Thus, accurate results can in principle be achieved provided
the spatial resolution is adequate.
Numerically the equations resulting from the introduction of the forcing (4) in the Navier-Stokes equations are
treated with a ﬁnite-volume discretization where the skew-symmetry of the nonlinear convective ﬂuxes and the
positive-deﬁnite dissipative nature of the viscous ﬂuxes are preserved [14]. This method can be shown to be stable on any (coarse) resolution, with a proper treating of a small scale details in a numerical solution. In order to
capture forces on the solid walls of the domain the treatment of the small near-wall ﬂow structures is essential. A
second order accurate method for the ﬂuxes is employed, implemented on a staggered grid. The eﬀect of these ﬂuxes
is integrated in time using an explicit time-stepping algorithm of Adams-Bashforth type [14]. The contribution of
the forcing term f is integrated implicitly in time, which overcomes severe stability problems that would arise with
explicit methods as ε
1. The total computational domain is endowed with periodic boundary conditions. In order
to generate a non-trivial ﬂow we impose a time-dependent pressure drop across the streamwise direction x, chosen
such that the desired unsteady ﬂow-rate is maintained. In total, the pressure can be expressed at a(t)x + p where p(x, t)
denotes a periodic pressure ﬁeld and a(t) is the time-dependent pressure gradient across the domain in the x direction.
The use of a staggered grid introduces the question how to deﬁne exactly the masking function. Intuitively, H
is easily deﬁned as indicated above. However, there is some freedom in its deﬁnition on grid-scale near a solidﬂuid interface. We work with an individual grid cell as the smallest elementary unit; this implies that a grid cell is
considered either as part of the solid or as part of the ﬂuid. We need to identify on which component of the solution
to base the masking function as all three velocity components u, v, w and the pressure p are deﬁned on their respective
grids. We choose to work with H p , which means that if the center of a primary grid cell is in the ﬂuid domain, then
the entire grid cell is deﬁned as part of Ω f . This allows to deﬁne the precise location (within the resolution of the
adopted grid) of the solid-ﬂuid interface in a ‘staircase’ approximation. The convergence of the volume-penalization
IB method can be established on the basis of laminar Poiseuille ﬂow in a straight cylindrical tube. This test-case was
considered in [8] and ﬁrst-order convergence was observed. This conﬁrms results obtained for the plane channel ﬂow
in case the no-slip condition is imposed within a grid cell of the solid wall [9].

The geometry of blood vessels in a human brain is much more complicated than straight cylindrical tube. The
ﬁrst step towards simulating ﬂow in more realistic vessel shapes is to consider smoothly curved geometries. To obtain
the masking function for such a vessel we rely on the smallest distance of a point x to the centerline of the curved
vessel. For each point of the computational domain we can ﬁnd the minimal distance to this centerline and check the
condition whether or not this distance is smaller than the radius of the cylindrical tube. If so, then the point (grid cell)
is in the ﬂuid domain and the masking function H = 0. Otherwise it is in solid domain and H = 1.

Figure 2: The convergence of the immersed boundary method for the ﬂow inside a curved cylindrical vessel is shown in terms of the evolution of
the pressure diﬀerence. Simulations are done for laminar ﬂow at Re = 1 at several grid resolutions: 32 × 8 × 16 (dot), 64 × 16 × 32 (dash-dot),
128 × 32 × 64 (dash) and 256 × 64 × 128 (solid). With increasing grid resolution the numerically obtained solution is seen to converge.

To illustrate the IB method for curved vessels we consider simple sinusoidal shapes for the centerline and a
constant circular cross-section in a plane locally normal to the tangent vector to the centerline. Simulations at Re = 1
as shown in Figure 1(a) clarify that the steady ﬂow which develops closely follows the shape of the vessel. At each
location a well-deﬁned velocity proﬁle emerges as is seen in Figure 1(b). To illustrate the convergence of the method
for curved vessel we consider the pressure diﬀerence over the ﬂow domain in the x-direction. The development of
this pressure diﬀerence at a number of spatial resolutions is displayed in Figure 2. We observe a clear convergence in
these pressure evolutions by comparing results obtained at N = 32, 64, 128 and 256. For longer simulation time all
these solutions converge to a steady state.
3. Reference pulsatile ﬂow dynamics
In this section we consider the dynamics of pulsatile ﬂow in a model aneurysm. First, we deﬁne the geometry
of the model aneurysm and motivate the adopted ﬂow conditions. Subsequently, we analyze the velocity ﬁeld and
shear forces for the reference case and compare the main characteristics as pressure drop and maximal shear stress for
pulsatile and constant mass ﬂow rate which have the same average ﬂow.
One of the common locations of cerebral aneurysms within the Circle of Willis is on the internal carotid artery
(ICA), where a typical mass ﬂow rate is reported to be Q ≈ 245ml/min [5]. The diameter of the ICA is of the
order of D ≈ 0.42cm [7]. Together, this leads to a reference velocity U ≈ 0.2947m/s and a corresponding Reynolds
number Re ≈ 354 in which we used as reference kinematic viscosity ν = 3.5 · 10−6 m2 /s [12]. The natural variation in
conditions and geometry motivate to use Reynolds numbers in the general range of 100-500, properly including this
estimate obtained from literature.
The Reynolds number Re is the only parameter which is required to specify the ﬂow conditions. It quantiﬁes the
ratio between the magnitude of the (destabilizing) convective transport u · ∇u and the (stabilizing) viscous processes
∇2 u. It is well known that for relatively small Reynolds numbers ﬂow is laminar and steady, which implies a smooth

velocity and pressure ﬁeld at every moment in time. With increasing Reynolds number the ﬂow can develop more
detailed vortical structures, e.g., associated with separated ﬂow near relatively abrupt changes in the shape of a vessel.
A further increase in Re usually implies that the ﬂow structures become unsteady with diﬀerent vortices. The range
of Reynolds numbers arising in the ﬂow in the Circle of Willis, as estimated above, corresponds to laminar ﬂow. As
point of reference we chose to work with Reynolds number Re = 500.
The ﬂow domain is composed of a simple sinusoidally shaped cylindrical tube of radius R to which we add a
spherical cavity of radius 3R, thus arriving at a conﬁguration that generates signiﬁcant ﬂow separation. As reference
length scale we adopt the basic radius R of the vessel. The geometry of the model aneurysm is based on a model for
curved blood vessel, which was described above in Section 2. The three dimensional geometry of the model aneurysm
is represented in Figure 3. The walls of the model aneurysm are assumed to be stationary in our studies reported here.
Further reﬁnements in which ﬂow-structure interactions will be included are subject of current research.
The blood ﬂow in a human body is pulsatile. Every person has their own complex heart beat characteristics. These
depend on all sorts of parameters [12]. One cardiac cycle consists of two phases: systole and diastole. Depending
on a stage the blood mass ﬂow rate is higher or lower than average. In our investigations here we do not consider all
details of a real cardiac cycle, but concentrate on a simple sinusoidal pulsatile ﬂow, representing a Fourier component
of the total cardiac pattern. We specify the average mass ﬂow rate and add a sinusoidal perturbation for which the
amplitude and the frequency can be varied. As point of reference the amplitude of the sinusoidal pulse is taken 10%
of the average ﬂow rate. The period of the oscillations is set to T = 20.
In Figure 4(a,b) we show the developing ﬂow in the model aneurysm. Two snapshots of the unsteady ﬂow are
plotted. The addition of a spherical cavity is seen to strongly aﬀect the ﬂow in the curved vessel, which leads to
massive ﬂow separation, e.g., from the rim of the spherical cavity. This produces a detached ‘jet’ that continuously
impinges on the wall of the cavity. The ﬂow shows complex vortical structures that ﬁll a large part of the spherical
cavity with recirculating ﬂow. The occurrence of such ﬂow structures contributes to an extension of the average
‘residence time’ of blood inside the ﬂow domain, expressing a deterioration of the quality of transport of nutrients to,
and waste products from the tissue surrounding the aneurysm. This can be an important indicator for the rate at which
health risks may develop.
The main challenge for the IB method in case of ﬂow through model aneurysms is in capturing the ﬂow near the
solid-ﬂuid interface, which is required to compute the shear stress. We deﬁne the shear stress in terms of the gradient
of the velocity as follows. The rate of strain tensor S is such that
S ij =

1
∂i u j + ∂ j ui

(5)

The shear stress τ is a measure of the components of S. It is deﬁned as
τ=

1
Re

2 S i jS i j

(6)

The distribution of the shear stress τ is an important indicator for the forces inside the model aneurysm and on its
wall. The shear stress is also relevant for long-time accumulation eﬀects that can lead to a deterioration of the quality

period of the pulsatile ﬂow is T = 20 while the amplitude is 10% of the long-time average. The ﬂow is visualized by plotting velocity vectors in a
cross-section through the geometry at grid resolution 32 × 16 × 32. Two snapshots of velocity ﬁelds at time t = 50 (a) and time t = 100 (b) illustrate
the unsteady ﬂow with various vortices inside the spherical cavity. Correspondingly, in (c) and (d) the characteristic impression of the shear stress
is shown. Dark regions relate to the areas with high shear stress values.

of the ﬂuid-solid interface. This makes the shear stress a key quantity of relevance for the prediction of long-term risk
of rupture of the aneurysm wall. In Figure 4(c,d) we show shear stress distributions at two characteristics moments
during the evolving ﬂow. We observe high shear stress levels in the curved vessel as well as associated with localized
vortices inside the spherical cavity.
In order to better understand the impact of pulsatility we compare pressure drop and shear stress obtained at
constant and pulsatile ﬂow. In Figure 5(a) we observe a strong eﬀect of the pulsatile ﬂow forcing on the pressure
drop across the domain. The maximal shear stress in Figure 5(b) shows a very complex time dependence with strong
variations in the shear stress and occasionally very high values. The shear stress does not display a very clear signature
of the periodic ﬂow forcing at this high value of Re. At these conditions the intrinsic unsteadiness of the ﬂow is
considerably stronger than the eﬀect of forcing. In the next section we consider the dynamics of the ﬂow under a
range of forcing and ﬂow conditions.

Figure 5: Pressure drop over the streamwise direction (a) and maximal shear stress in the domain (b). We compare ﬂow with constant mass ﬂow
rate (dash) with pulsatile ﬂow at the same average ﬂow rate (solid). Simulations are done at Re = 500. The period of the pulsatile ﬂow is T = 20
and the amplitude of ﬂow rate variations is 10% of the long-time mean.

4. Pressure drop and shear stress levels in pulsatile ﬂow
In this section we consider the eﬀect of varying the forcing amplitude and the eﬀect of changing the ﬂow conditions. These illustrate the ﬂexibility and robustness with which the IB method can handle a range of dynamic
conditions.
In Figure 6 we show pressure drop and shear stress levels at Re = 500 and a range of amplitudes of the pulsatile
variations in the ﬂow rate. The main signature of the pressure drop and the shear stress is the same as that observed in
Figure 5, the main diﬀerence being that an increase in the forcing amplitude leads to a somewhat stronger response in
the shear stress. As remarked earlier, at Re = 500 the intrinsic dynamics of the ﬂow at the selected mean ﬂow rate is
suﬃciently strong to overwhelm the eﬀects of the pulsatile ﬂow as far as the shear stress is concerned.
We next present results for diﬀerent Reynolds numbers, ﬁxing the amplitude of the pulsatile oscillations to 10%.
We consider Re = 100, 250 and 500. There are two, dynamically diﬀerent situations that correspond to these variations in the Reynolds number. If (situation A) we would keep the mass ﬂow rate unchanged then a decrease in the
Reynolds number, assuming ﬁxed geometry, corresponds to an increase in the ﬂuid viscosity. If (situation B) at ﬁxed
geometry, we intend to keep the viscosity ﬁxed, i.e., keep the physical properties of the ﬂuid ﬁxed, then a reduction in
Re has to be accompanied with a reduction in the ﬂow rate with the same factor. The two situations A and B will be
presented next.
We investigated the evolution of the pressure drop and the shear stress for situation A, i.e., the ﬁxed ﬂow rate
situation. The eﬀect of pulsatility is stronger at lower Re, i.e., in case the ﬂuid is more viscous. To maintain a given
ﬂow rate while increasing the viscosity, we observed that the pressure drop needs to be increased. In Figure 7(a) the
shear stress levels are seen to increase with increasing viscosity. This response is in stark contrast with situation B in
which we vary the Reynolds number, while keeping the viscosity of the ﬂuid and the geometry ﬁxed. In situation B we
noticed that a reduction of the Reynolds number, i.e., a slower ﬂow, implies a reduction in the pressure drop over the
domain. The shear stress levels are seen to be lower when the Reynolds number is reduced (Figure 7(b). Not only the
level but also the complexity of the shear stress response is considerably diminished with reduced Reynolds number.
All these ﬁndings correspond directly with physical intuition, illustrating the qualitative reliability of the simulations.

Figure 6: Pressure diﬀerence across the streamwise direction (a) and maximal shear stress (b) comparing ﬂow with a constant mass ﬂow rate (dash)
with pulsatile ﬂow at the same average ﬂow rate. We employ diﬀerent amplitudes of the pulsatile variations (10% – solid, 25% – dot, 50% –
dash-dot). Simulations are done at Re = 500. The period of the pulsatile ﬂow is T = 20.

5. Conclusions
In this paper we presented a basic immersed boundary method (IB) for the prediction of pulsatile viscous ﬂow in
models for cerebral aneurysms. Applications of this method to simple model geometries such as a curved vessel and a
model aneurysm were presented. The ﬂow was simulated successfully using the IB approach. Complex ﬂow structures
were observed at Re = 500, displaying a signiﬁcant ﬂow separation inside the spherical cavity and complex, intrinsic
ﬂow dynamics that is not very sensitive to external ﬂow rate variations. Such would correspond to an aneurysm that
developed into a considerable size in which the ﬂow response is somewhat disconnected from the bodily rhythms.
The pressure drop across the domain was found to reﬂect the periodic forcing much more clearly, even at high Re.
The shear stress on the vessel and aneurysm walls was computed as well. At high Re a highly irregular, rapidly
varying shear stress development was recorded, which could possibly induce an acceleration in the development of
the aneurysm in its ﬁnal stages. In order to extract more reliably such general information of clinical relevance, more
research is needed into the reliability of the simulation results.
We showed the application of the IB method for a range of ﬂow conditions and pulsatile forcing. Changes in the
amplitude of the pulsatile ﬂow do not seem to generate qualitative diﬀerence - rather an increase in the forcing amplitude leads to a corresponding increase in pressure drop and shear stress. Conversely, changes in the ﬂow conditions
can give rise to strong qualitative diﬀerences. We investigated two, physically diﬀerent situations. Keeping the scale
of the problem ﬁxed we compared results at diﬀerent viscosity, keeping the ﬂow rate ﬁxed, and results at diﬀerent
ﬂow rate, keeping the viscosity ﬁxed. The latter situation corresponds most closely to actual physiological conditions
in which a higher ﬂow rate, i.e., higher Reynolds number, requires a higher pressure drop, giving rise to higher shear
stresses and considerably more complex ﬂow development in terms of vortical structures and shear stress maxima. In
case the viscosity is varied at ﬁxed ﬂow rate we observed the more unusual situation of an increased pressure drop
and shear stress in case of a lower Reynolds number. This is solely due to the requirement of generating a ﬁxed
mass ﬂow for an ever more viscous ﬂuid. In each of these cases the IB method readily provided the qualitative ﬂow
consequences, even at rather coarse resolutions.
The application of computational support in the monitoring and treatment of cerebral aneurysms is a ﬁeld of
ongoing research. The location, time-dependence and intensity of peaks in the shear stress are all of relevance to
medical practice, as these appear to be related to the long-time evolution of the condition of vessel walls. In order to
achieve a closer connection with medical practice several steps need to be taken. A central element is the incorporation
of realistic patient aneurysms and their coupling to proper inﬂow and outﬂow conditions. As illustrated in this paper,

Figure 7: Maximal shear stress comparing ﬂow with a constant mass ﬂow rate (lines marked with circles) with pulsatile ﬂow at the same average
ﬂow rate. The amplitude of mass ﬂow rate variations is 10% of the long-time average. Simulations are done at Re = 500 (solid), Re = 250
(dash-dot) and Re = 100 (dashed) (a) changing viscosity and (b) changing ﬂow velocity. The period of the pulsatile ﬂow is T = 20.

the use of the IB method provides an invaluable point of departure for the geometric representation of complex
aneurysms. The inﬂow and outﬂow conditions pose a more intricate modeling problem in which the challenge is
to approximate patient-speciﬁc in vivo conditions. Other main elements are the inclusion of non-Newtonian ﬂuid
corrections and the proper capturing of the interaction between the ﬂow and the aneurysm structure. In all these
aspects, attention should be given to the computational robustness of predictions, focusing on the relation between the
general topology of ﬂow structures and the shear stress characteristics.
