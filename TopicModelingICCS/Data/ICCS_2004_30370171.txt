Abstract. Computational analysis of unidirectional transient problems in
multiscale heterogeneous media using specially adopted homogenization
technique and the Finite Element Method is described below. Multiresolutional
homogenization being the extension of the classical micro-macro traditional
approach is used to calculate effective parameters of the composite.
Effectiveness of the method is compared against previous techniques thanks to
the FEM solution of some engineering problems with real material parameters
and with their homogenized values. Further computational studies are necessary
in this area, however application of the multiresolutional technique is justified
by the natural multiscale character of composites.

1 Introduction
Wavelet analysis [1] perfectly reflects the very demanding needs of composite
materials computational modeling. It is due to the fact that wavelet functions like
Haar, sinusoidal (harmonic), Gabor, Morlet or Daubechies, for instance, relating
neighboring scales in the medium analysed can efficiently model a variety of
heterogeneities preserving composites periodicity, for instance. It is evident now that
wavelet techniques may serve for analysis in the finest scale by various numerical
techniques [2,4,5] as well as using multiresolutional analysis (MRA) [3,5,6,8]. The
first method leads to the exponential increase of the total number of degrees of
freedom in the model, because each new decomposition level almost doubles this
number, while an application of the homogenization method is connected with
determination of effective material parameters.
Both methodologies are compared here in the context of eigenvalue problem
solution for a simply supported linear elastic Euler-Bernoulli beam using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) computational procedures. The corresponding comparison
made for a transient heat transfer has been discussed before in [5]. Homogenization of
a composite is performed here through (1) simple spatial averaging of composite
properties, (2) two-scale classical approach [7] as well as (3) thanks to the
multiresolutional technique based on the Haar wavelets. An application of the
symbolic package MAPLE guarantees an efficient integration of algebraic formulas
defining effective properties for a composite with material properties given by some
wavelet functions.

2 Multiresolutional Homogenization Scheme
MRA approach uses the algebraic transformation between various scales provided by
the wavelet analysis to determine the fine-scale behavior and introduce it explicitly
into the macroscopic equilibrium equations. The following relation:
(1)
Ω ⊂ Ω ⊂ Ω ⊂ ...
−1

0

−2

defines the hierarchical geometry of the scales and this chain of subspaces is so
defined that Ω is “finer” than Ω . Further, let us note that the main assumption on
j

j+1

general homogenization procedure for transient problems is a separate averaging of
the coefficients from the governing partial differential equation responsible for a static
behavior and of the unsteady component. The problem can be homogenized only if its
equilibrium can be expressed by the following operator equation:
(2)
BT + u + λ = L(AT + v )
This equation in the multiscale notation can be rewritten at the given scale j as

multiscale DOF per the original finite element, scale 2 – next two additional

The composite specimen is discretized using each time 128 2-noded linear finite
elements with unitary inertia moments. The comparison starts from a collection of the
eigenvalues reflecting different homogenization techniques given in Tab. 1. Further,
st
the eigenvalues for heterogeneous beams are given for 1 order wavelet projection in
nd
rd
Tab. 2, for 2 order projection – in Tab. 3, 3 order - in Tab. 4.
The eigenvalues computed for various homogenization models approximate the
values computed for the real composite models with different accuracy - the weakest
efficiency is detected in case of spatially averaged composite and the difference in
relation to the real structure results increase together with the eigenvalue number and
the projections order. The results obtained thanks to MRA projection are closer to
those relevant to MRA homogenization for a single RVE in composite; classical
homogenization is more effective for increasing number of the cells in this model.

Free vibrations for 2 and 3-bays periodic beams are solved using classical and
homogenization-based FEM implementation. The unitary inertia momentum is taken
in all computational cases, ten periodicity cells compose each bay, while material
properties inserted in the numerical model are calculated by spatial averaging,
classical and multiresolutional homogenization schemes and compared against the
real structure response. First 10 eigenvalues changes for all these beams are contained
in Figs. 1,2 – the resulting values are marked on the vertical axes, while the number of
eigenvalue being computed – on the horizontal ones.

Eigenvalues obtained for various homogenization models approximate the values
computed for the real composite with different accuracy - the worst efficiency in
eigenvalues modeling is detected in case of spatially averaged composite and the
difference in relation to the real structure results increase together with the eigenvalue
number. Wavelet-based and classical homogenization methods give more accurate
results – the first method is better for smaller number of the bays, and classical
homogenization approach is recommended in case of increasing number of the bays
and the RVEs. The justification of this observation comes from the fact, that the
wavelet function is less important for the increasing number of the periodicity cells in

178

the structure. Another interesting result is that the efficiency of approximation of the
maximum deflections for a multi-bay periodic composite beam by the deflections
encountered for homogenized systems increase together with an increase of the total
number of the bays.

6 Conclusions
The most important result of the homogenization-based Finite Element modeling of
the periodic unidirectional composites is that the real composite behavior is rather
well approximated by the homogenized model response. MRA homogenization
technique giving more accurate approximation of the real structure behavior is
decisively more complicated in numerical implementation since necessity of usage of
the combined symbolic-FEM approach. The technique introduces new opportunities
to calculate effective parameters for the composites with material properties
approximated by various wavelet functions. A satisfactory agreement between the real
and homogenized structures models enables the application to other transient
problems with deterministic as well as stochastic material parameters.
Multiresolutional homogenization procedure has been established here using the
Haar basis to determine complete mathematical equations for homogenized
coefficients and to make implementation of the FEM-based homogenization analysis.
As it was documented above, the Haar basis approximation gives sufficient
approximation of various mathematical functions describing most of possible spatial
distributions of composites physical properties.
