Abstract
We study the diffusive process and the multifractal property in the Baduk. We are able to ascertain the superdiffusive process that
the dispersion is proportional to t with the scaling exponent =1.66േ0.26 for our model. After simulating the multifractal
behavior, we analyze the multifractal strength of three different segments.
Key words: Superdiffusive process; Generalized Hurst exponent; Renyi exponent; Singularity spectrum; Multifractal strength

1. Introduction
Historically, the random walk in stochastic processes has been treated and discussed from the beginning of
statistical physics. In particular, the diffusion process has played a crucial role in the transport process [1]. Several
researchers [2] have shown that the diffusion coefficient is related to the transition probability in the random walk,
whereas the transition probability is related to the hopping rate in the master equation. Twenty years ago, the
anomalous diffusion and Levy flight [3] were studied in scientific fields that are associated with nonlinear dynamics.
Recently, subdiffusive processes are studied in the context of binary chemical reactions [4].
Over the past three decades, fractals [5] have been studied extensively in several fields including social science,
and considerable attention has been drawn to the study of deterministic and real structures of fractals. Currently, a
lot of research is being examined to find a fractal nature in scientific systems, especially after the pioneering work of
Mandelbrot [6]. The fractal structure can be found in the coast line, mountain, ocean tomography, cloud drift, and
deposition model [7]. The fractal nature is garnering considerable attention [8-12] and several studies have
unanimously indicated the presence of a fractal nature as well as the possibility of multi-scaling in rainfall,
temperature, wind speed.
The multifractal technique has been widely used for the delineation of fractal scaling properties in nonstationary
time series [7-9]. It is well-known that the cascade process in fully developed turbulence describes the breaking-up
of eddies into smaller sub-eddies in terms of energy dissipation [13]. Recently, Kantelhardt et al. [14] proposed an
alternative approach based on a generalization of the detrended fluctuation analysis method. It was basically devised
for the analysis of a non-stationary time series by incorporating it with a detrending procedure. The multifractal

detrended fluctuation analysis is an extension of the conventional detrended fluctuation analysis [15,16], which is a
scaling analysis technique of a time series.
Baduk is a two-player strategy game played on a board with a 17×17 grid. The Baduk game is also known as
Weiqi, Igo, and Go in China, Japan, and USA, respectively. In this paper, our purpose is to study the diffusive
process and the multifractal property in the Baduk time series. In particular, we will estimate and analyze the
generalized Hurst exponent, singularity spectrum. We also simulate and analyze the multifractal strength in the
number of ended stones when the Baduk game is over.

2. Theoretical method and numerical calculations
2.1 Diffusion process
The diffusion process is broadly classified according to the temporal scaling of the mean square displacement: <
r2(t) >~ t for normal diffusion, r 2 (t ) ~ t with
1 for subdiffusion ,
1 for superdiffusion, and < r2(t) >~
log t for strong diffusion. Here r(t) means the displacement (or the difference of position) between black and white
stones when two players are playing a Baduk game, as shown in Fig. 1.

We first analyze the diffusive process in the Baduk Time series. The data in the diffusive process has been quoted
from the 400 games that Chang-Ho Lee competed in from January 1989 to June 2007. Chang-Ho Lee is a Korean 9dan professional Go player who is widely regarded as one of the strongest modern Go players.
As shown in Fig. 2, we ascertain that the dispersion is proportional to t with the scaling exponent = 1.66േͲ.26.
The Baduk displacements are generated by a superdiffusion process with >1, similar to the Levy-type anomalous
superdiffusion [3], where we find a scaling exponent between 1 < < 3. Segment 5, 10, 20 means one series with
size 5, 10, 20 over data for the difference of the number of ended stones of 400 games, respectively. The number of
ended stones is a measure of all the number of stones when one game is over. The number of dead stones held by a
player is a measure of the size of his or her territory.

N Ns s N . In order to include information contained in the remaining part N , after splitting the time series into

Ns intervals of length s starting from the front in Eq. (2), we split the time series into Ns intervals of length s
starting from the back in Eq. (3). In order to scan the degree of contribution of a certain segment with size s to

is an important parameter describing the width of the multifractal spectrum in the Baduk game. The larger
is, the stronger the multifractality is. Hence we can estimate the multifractal strength of the time series in
terms of the range of q in order to identify its multifractal properties.
In order to analyze the multifractal quantities, data was also quoted from the 1113 games that are considered the
formal competitions between Chang-Ho Lee and another player from June 1987 to May 2008. Fig. 3 is the data of
the number of ended stones when one Baduk game is over. Segment 5, 10, 20 denote one series with size 5, 10, 20
over data for values of the ended stones in 400 games, respectively. The ended stones mean total number of stones
when one Baduk game is over. From this data, we can analyze the generalized Hurst exponent, singularity spectrum,
and multifractal strength. In Fig. 4, we find the generalized Hurst exponent hq as a function of q from Eq. (5), for
three different segments from the data of the number of ended stones in the Baduk. The singularity spectrum is also
shown for three kinds of segments from the data of the number of ended stones in the Baduk, as plotted in Fig. 5.

Lastly, it shows the multifractal strength
obtained via Eq. (9) from the result of Fig. 4. Among the segments we calculate that the multifractal strength of
segment 5 is larger than that of other segments. This means the segment, in which the multifractal property is
strongly observed. Hence the segment 5 has no mono-fractal property, indicating that its characteristics are quite
different from the other segments.
3. Conclusions
We have studied study the diffusive process and the multifractal property in the Baduk time series. We have
ascertained the superdiffusive process that the dispersion is proportional to t with the scaling exponent =1.66േ0.26.

In multifractal structures, segment 5 has shown a stronger multifractal behavior than the other segments for the
tipping points of the Baduk.
In order to obtain a more detailed investigation of the multifractality, we need to extend our research to include
Baduk players from other countries in the future. Finally, this multifractal analysis formalism can be extended to
both discrimination and characterization for other Baduk statistical quantities.
