Abstract. A new thermo-elasto-plastic constitutive model of saturated clay is
proposed here based on the double hardening model for clays and available
experimental results, which describes the effects of temperature and over
consolidation ratio on the mechanical properties of saturated clays by
introducing the two hardening parameters - σ c′ & α . Finally, the proposed
model is applied to model the related important features of saturated clays
under the different temperatures and loadings and compared with the available
experimental results to demonstrate its accuracy.
Keywords: Thermo-mechanical behavior, Saturated clay, Constitutive model.

1 Introduction
Recently more attention has been focused on researching the mechanical response of
soils to the combined effects of stress and temperature which is important in many
geotechnical engineering applications. A number of experiments were carried out to
investigate the influence of temperature on the behaviors of soils [1][2]. To study the
effects of temperature on clays, a few of constitutive models were proposed to
describe the thermo-elasto-plastic behavior of the solid skeleton [3][4]. Most of the
above models mainly focused on modeling the thermal-mechanical behaviors of
saturated soils under the constant loading, but without considering the different overconsolidated ratio (OCR) effects under the isothermal triaxial drained conditions. In
this paper, we propose a new thermo-elasto-plastic constitutive model to describe the
combined effects of the temperature and the OCR on the mechanical properties of
saturated clays and verify it with the available experimental results.

2 Thermo-Mechanical Constitutive Equations of Saturated Clay
2.1 The Formulation of the Constitutive Equations
Based on the above experimental results, a thermo-elastic-plastic constitutive
equation is deduced in the following. Let

The thermo-elastic strain tensor ε Te is the superposition of a reversible thermal
induced strain ε T and a mechanical elastic strain ε e under adiabatic conditions. In
incremental form we have
dε Te = dε T + dε e

(2)

The elastic shear strain is assumed as purely mechanical, so we have
dε vTe =

dσ m′
+ β s′dT
K

and

dε se =

dσ s

where dε vTe is the volumetric thermo-elastic strain increment, dε se is the shear strain
increment, dσ m′ is the mean effective stress increment , dσ s is the shear stress
increment, dT is the temperature increment, β s′ is the isotropic thermal expansion
coefficient of the solid skeleton, K is bulk elastic modulus and G is shear elastic
modulus.
The thermal-plastic strain depends on deformation and temperature history, and in
general cannot be uniquely expressed through effective stress and temperature. Based
on the double hardening model for clays [5] under the isothermal temperature
condition, the irreversible thermal effects are introduced using the dependence of
yield surface, flow rule and internal variables on temperature. The yield surface is
assumed to be a function of stress, plastic volumetric strain and plastic shear strain
and temperature variation dT (referring to an environmental temperature To ),

2.2 The Determination of the Model Parameters
For the thermo-elastic case, the three sets of parameters K , G and β s′ , can be determined in this
paper as follows,

⎛σ′ ⎞
K = K ref ⎜⎜ m ⎟⎟ G = Gref ⎜⎜ m ⎟⎟
P
a
⎝
⎠
⎝ Pa ⎠

m

(14)

where K ref and Gref are the bulk and shear modulus at a reference pressure;
Pa = 0.104 MPa, and m = a1 (σ c / σ o ) + b1 , a1 , b1 are constants, σ c is consolidated pressure,
σ o is unit pressure and OCR is the over-consolidation ratio.
β s′ = β so′ (3.5 − 0.2(OCR ))(1 + ςT )(OCR )

(15)

In which β so′ is the volumetric thermal expansion coefficient at the reference
temperature, and ς corresponds to the slope of the variation of β s′ with respect to
present temperature T .
While for the thermo-plastic parameters, due to the lack of experimental results,
the thermo-plastic potential function is assumed to be the same as the yield function
g = F and α c (T ) = α c (To ) + N s (T − To )

(16)

Where α c (To ) is the reference value at the reference temperature To , N s is a constant.
Other parameters in equation (7) can be determined as follows: α m = n 1+ n sin ϕ r and
ϕ r is residual frictional angle; n = a 2 (σ c / σ o ) + b2 , a 2 , b2 , α o and ca are constants.

3 Validation of the Proposed Model
The validation tests were conducted on CM clay (Kaolin) under triaxial shear conditions
with different temperatures [6]. These comparisons were made at two different
temperatures for two over-consolidation ratios (OCR=1.2 and 3). Figure 1 and Figure 2
show the results for the isothermal triaxial cases conducted at 22 °C and 90 °C,
respectively. The model parameters used are: σ c′ (To ) = 0.6 MPa ,
β so′ = −1.3 ×10−5 (D C −1 ) , ς = −0.003 , β = 5.2 , γ = 0.17 , K ref = 1.65 MPa, Gref = 0.92 MPa,
C a = 0.5 , ϕ r = 23D

，α

，N

s

= −0.03 , a1 = 1.33 , b1 = 0.835 ,

a 2 = 2.33 , b2 = 0.035 .All the above results demonstrated that the proposed model can

reproduce the major aspects of the temperature influence on mechanical behavior of
saturated clays and agrees well with the experimental results.

4 Conclusions
The effects of both the temperature and the over consolidation ratio (OCR) on the
mechanical properties of saturated clays are described by introducing two hardening
parameters. The proposed model has been applied to compare with the experimental
results, which demonstrated that the new model may describe many important thermoelastic-plastic features of saturated clays well.
