Abstract. We propose a new classification of complex networks in association
with a function of networks. Networks are considered to be input-output system
where the initial condition is input and the evolving dynamics is output. We study
a functional relationship between the input and the output which depend on network structures. A function of network are modeled as a spin interaction system
driven by Glauber dynamics with arbitrary initial conditions. Through numerical
studies, we show a novel classification of networks. The results are applied to
examples of real-world networks, which proved the classification to be useful for
analysis of the inherent characteristics and model assumption for the real-world
networks.

1 Introduction
Recently, a considerable number of works have been done on various networks in the
real world, such as the Internet, the world wide web, social networks and many others to
understand their properties so far [1, 2, 3] . Statistical properties of networks which are
commonly seen in many instances of networks in nature, have been revealed; scale-free
degree distribution, relatively short distance between nodes, clustered structure with
high clustering coefficient and existence of community structure are the examples. A
number of theoretical models of complex networks which realize these properties have
also been proposed [4, 5, 6, 7].
There are some classes of networks structures considered in the context of complex
network science, typically known as scale-free networks or small-world networks. Such
classes are of use for assuming a model for a real-world network. However, classification of complex networks is still not a simple problem, for mathematical representation
for real-world networks is almost impossible, due to their complicated structures. Because of this difficulty, only a little is known about classes of networks, mainly by basic
statistical properties, such as degree distributions.
Not only statistical structures of networks, there are other groups of studies from
the point of view of functions of networks. Examples include evolution of magnetized
spin glasses [8, 9], synchronization of coupled oscillators [10] and transport [11] on
complex networks. From this perspective, networks are often treated as a structure of
an interaction pattern in systems. Suppose a time-progressing dynamics on a complex

network to be a response of the network corresponding to an initial condition, one can
regard the network as an input-output system, where the initial condition is regarded
as input and the evolving dynamics is output. If there is a certain relationship between
the input and the output of a network, it may represent a new characteristic hidden in
the network structure, and networks may be classified in relation to the input-output
relations.
We already reported in the previous paper that characteristic behaviors occur in a
spin system on networks evolving by Glauber dynamics, corresponding to arbitrarily
determined initial conditions [12], and proposed a new method to analyze a structure
of networks. In this paper, we study a classification of networks in association with a
function of networks, with extending our previous work. Through a series of numerical
studies using complex network models, we show several classes of networks.

2 Glauber Dynamics on Networks with Arbitrary Initial
Conditions
We consider a spin system of zero-temperature Glauber dynamics on complex networks, with spin variables σ = ±1 located at each vertex of a network. The local field
hi (τ ) operating on vertex i at time step τ , due to the spins of the neighboring vertices
of the vertex i, is given by
N

hi (τ ) =

Aij σj (τ )

(i = 1...N ),

(1)

j

where Aij is the adjacency matrix, which in this paper is considered to be symmetric. In
our previous work, we investigated a similar dynamics as a two-state diffusion process
[12]: The model is described as follows.
σi (n + 1) =

sgn {hi (n)} if hi (n) = 0
σ(n) if hi (n) = 0.

(2)

In this model, the spins of vertices are updated synchronously at each time step n, that
is, all vertices are updated their spins simultaneously as n progresses. In this paper, a
general Monte Carlo method is used for the numerical simulations. The spins of individual vertices are updated asynchronously. At each step τ , a vertex is randomly chosen
and its spin is updated according to the following rule:
σi (τ + 1) =

sgn {hi (τ )} if hi (τ ) = 0
±1 (probability 1/2) if hi (τ ) = 0.

(3)

Initial condition at τ = 0 is arbitrarily determined according to centrality of vertices. Corresponding to the centralities of each vertex, the rN vertices with the largest
centrality are assigned the positive spin state at the initial state (σ(0) = +1), while the
remaining (1 − r)N vertices are assigned σ(0) = −1. Here, r is the initial fraction of
positive spins, and N is the number of vertices in the network. We consider r and the

Classification of Networks Using Network Functions

type of centralities as an input to a network. For an output, we investigate a fraction
of positive spins at t = ∞, which is denoted by r . We study the r-r relations as the
input-output relationships of the system.

3 Numerical Studies
In this section, we explain the numerical results, and the classes emerging out from the
input-output relations of networks. In addition to the models, we apply the method to
several real-world networks to study their classes.
3.1 Network Models and Initial Conditions
In this paper, we deal with several network models: Regular lattice, random graph (RA),
Watts-Strogatz (WS) model [4] (the mixing parameter p is set p = 0.1), Barab´asi-Albert
(BA) model [5], Klemm-Eg´ıulz (KE) model [6] (the mixing parameter μ is set μ = 0
and μ = 0.1) and Connecting Nearest Neighbor (CNN) model [7]. Each model has
its inherent characteristics. Their classes from conventional structural classification are
briefly explained in Table. 1. See related references for further details of the models.

scale-free, small-world
scale-free, highly-clustered
scale-free, small-world, highly-clustered
scale-free, small-world, highly-clustered

In order to determine initial input of spins, we consider four different orderings as
mentioned in the previous section: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness
centrality, clustering coefficient. See Refs. [4, 13] for the detail of these centralities.
3.2 Numerical Results and Typical Input-Output Relations
In the numerical studies, the number of vertices of each network is N = 36000, and the
average degree is k = 10. They are always confirmed to be connected, that is, all of
the networks are composed of a single connected component. In addition, the numerical
results presented in this paper are averaged over tens of realizations.
The results for all networks and initial conditions are listed in Fig. 1. As for the
lattice, there is no discrimination of vertices about the centralities, so the initial spins are
randomly distributed with the fraction r. In our previous paper (the model is represented

652

by Eqn. (2), a certain oscillation mode was observed at n = ∞ [12], while no oscillation
occurred in the model by Eqn. 3. However, the r-r relations of both models turned out
to be essentially the same.
From Fig. 1, we find several characteristic patterns in the r-r relations. They are
briefly reviewed in the following (Fig. 2). The patterns are classified by step-like function, sigmoid-like function, convex curve with/without critical point and linear-like
function with/without intercept:
Step function. For most cases on random graph and BA model, a r-r relation like
step function as shown in Fig. 2(a) is observed. Positive spins disappear unless the
fraction in the input does not exceed a certain fraction rc , otherwise they prevails
in the whole network.
Sigmoid function. In some cases the transition at the critical fraction rc is rather moderate. In such cases, the r-r relation forms a shape like sigmoid function as shown
in Fig. 2(b).
Convex curve with/without critical point. In other cases, the shape is fairly different.
Positive spins disappear when r is less than rc , while they survive in a higher fraction than r if r > rc , as shown in Fig. 2(c). For some cases there is no critical point,
where rc ∼ 0, as shown in Fig. 2(c’).
Linear function with/without intercept. For another input, the r-r relation forms a
liner function, where the spins does hardly prevail nor shrink from the initial state,
as shown in Fig. 2(d). In some cases r |r=0 = r0 > 0, where the positive spins
survives in the limit of r ∼ 0, as shown in Fig. 2(d’).
3.3 Classification of Networks
According to the patterns described above, the input-output relations of networks can
be classified as Table. 2. The classes seem not to be directly related to the conventional
structural classes, however, there are some clue to investigate them. The pattern (a)
is only observed on the random graph and the BA model. It may be related to low
clustering. The pattern (c) and (d), which are seen on highly-clustered networks, are
more complicated. The critical point rc of the pattern (c) are different for the cases. The
patten (d) are seen on the input by closeness centrality and betweenness centrality. They
may be related to inherent characteristics of these networks and centralities. Thus, the
patterns of the input-output relations of networks can be related to a new classification
of networks.
3.4 Application to Real-World Networks
To utilize the classification discussed in the previous section, we apply this analysis
and classification to two examples real-world networks. One is a network of Japanese
social networking service (SNS) ”mixi”, where a node is a user and an edge is their
registered friendship. The other is a network of entries of weblogs, where a node is
an individual entries of weblogs and an edge is a trackback between entries. They can
be both recognized as scale-free, small-world and highly-clustered networks based on
the conventional classification. The basic statistics (number of vertices N , number of

Classification of Networks Using Network Functions

655

The r-r relations of the real-world networks by the proposed method and their
classes are shown in Fig. 4 and Table. 3. They also have unique classes. As for the
SNS network, the results are classified into the same class as the CNN model, except
the input of closeness centrality. Especially, the form of the r-r relationship for the
input of clustering coefficient has the same characteristic of discontinuity as that of the
CNN model. As for the weblogs network, the linear pattern (d) of the input of closeness
centrality, which is seen on the KE network, is observed.
These classes may represent the inherent characteristics of the networks which do not
appear in the conventional statistical characteristics. These results imply that the inherent structure of the SNS network is well modeled by the CNN model, and the inherent
characteristics about the closeness centrality of the weblogs network are modeled by
the KE model. The classes proposed in this paper can thus be useful for classification
and model assumption of real-world networks.

4 Conclusion
We proposed a new classification of networks, using the function of networks. A network is considered to be an input-output system, and the classes are related to a functional relationship of arbitrary input and response (output) to the input. As a model
of function, we considered a spin interaction system with arbitrary initial conditions
on networks. Numerical studies using complex network models revealed that networks
are classified into four fundamental classes. The classes is considered to represent an
inherent characteristic of networks.

Applying the method to two examples of real-world network, it is shown that the
classes also appears on the real-world networks, and that the classification can be used
for model assumption for studying an unknown characteristic of a real-world network.
