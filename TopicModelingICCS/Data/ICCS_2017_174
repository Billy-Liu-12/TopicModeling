interface and domain was studied in [2] by using finite element method (FEM) to solve an
equivalent minimization problem. The corresponding analysis was done in [20] by assuming the
solution and the normal derivatives continuous across the interface. Nearly optimal error estimates in both L2 norm and energy norm for this problem was obtained in [11] for a fitted FEM.
An unfitted FEM based on Nitsche’s method is studied and the optimal order of convergence
is obtained for this problem in [14].
To define the weak form of (1)-(4), we first introduce some necessary Sobolev spaces:
H01 (Ωi ) = {v ∈ H 1 (Ωi ) : v = 0 on ∂Ωi \Γ} (i = 1, 2), L20 (Ωi ) = {v  ∈ L2 (Ωi ) : v =
0 on ∂Ωi \Γ} (i = 1, 2), W0 = (w1 , w2 ) ∈ H01 (Ω1 ) × H01 (Ω2 ) : w1 Γ = w2 Γ . Note that if
Ω2 is immersed in Ω as shown in the left of Fig 1, then H01 (Ω2 ) = H 1 (Ω2 ). Thus we can obtain
the following weak form of problem (1)-(4): find (u1 , u2 ) ∈ W0 such that
(β1 ∇u1 , ∇v1 )Ω1 + (β2 ∇u2 , ∇v2 )Ω2 = (f1 , v1 )Ω1 + (f2 , v2 )Ω2 + (q, v2 )Γ , ∀ (v1 , v2 ) ∈ W0 .

(5)

In order to numerically fulfill the requirement of space W0 , i.e., u1 = u2 on the interface Γ,
we need to define a conforming finite element space on a body-fitted mesh that aligns on the
interface Γ. Then, by means of the conforming finite element discretization, we can implement
two fundamental numerical schemes to solve (5): monolithic scheme and partitioned scheme.
The monolithic scheme directly produces a linear algebraic system based upon the finite element
discretization of (5) that involves all primary unknowns from both sub-problems defined in
either side of Γ, inducing a more complicated structure of coefficient matrix comparing with
the ones arising from each simpler sub-problem. Thus a new linear algebraic solver and its new
preconditioner need to be developed in order to solve such a problem-dependent monolithic
matrix equation in an efficient and robust fashion.
If the partitioned scheme is adopted to solve (5), then the Dirichlet-Neumann alternating
iteration method is usually adopted as shown in Algorithm 1, where, in each iteration step we
first solve one sub-problem (6) defined in Ω1 with Dirichlet boundary condition on Γ hence the
interface condition (2) is employed, then we solve the other sub-problem (7) with Neumann
boundary condition on Γ thus the other interface condition (3) is implemented. The finite
element discretization system derived from each standard sub-problem can then be solved by
classical linear solvers. The convergence of such iteration depends on the jump coefficients
[13, 12]. On the aspect of finite element error analysis, we need to take the interface integral,
(β1 ∇u1 · n1 , v2 ), in (7) into consideration, which needs the trace theorem to estimate. However,
since the weak solution of sub-problem I, u1 ∈ H 1 (Ω1 ), leading to ∇u1 · n1 |Γ ∈ H −1/2 (Γ).
∂·
acting from H 1 (Ω1 )
According to a well known fact that the trace of a normal derivative ∂n
1
to H −1/2 (Γ) does not exist [1, 19], we are not able to conduct a priori error estimate for
Algorithm 1 without the existence of trace theorem for (β1 ∇u1 · n1 , v2 )Γ on the right hand side

• Sub-problem I (Dirichlet boundary condition):

Find u1 ∈ V1 = {v ∈ H01 (Ω1 ) : v = 0 on ∂Ω1 \Γ, v = u2 on Γ} such that
(β1 ∇u1 , ∇v1 )Ω1 = (f1 , v1 )Ω1 , ∀v1 ∈ V1,0 = {v ∈ H 1 (Ω1 ) : v = 0 on ∂Ω1 \Γ}. (6)

• Sub-problem II (Neumann boundary condition):

Find u2 ∈ V2 = {v ∈ H01 (Ω2 ) : v = 0 on ∂Ω2 \Γ} such that
(β2 ∇u2 , ∇v2 )Ω2 = (f2 , v2 )Ω2 + (q, v2 )Γ − (β1 ∇u1 · n1 , v2 )Γ ,

of (7) (see e.g. [16, 17] and the references therein). Of course one may speculate that this issue
of lack of regularity is not relevant at the finite dimensional level, for instance, for finite element
approximation. However, the difficulty is only hidden, and we should expect that it will show
up as the mesh parameter h goes to zero [13].
To avoid the normal derivative of primary unknown on the interface Γ in the partitioned
scheme, we develop a mixture of standard- and mixed finite element method as follows, in which
(7) is reformulated by order reduction and then discretized by mixed finite element method,
while (6) remains unchanged and is discretized by standard Galerkin method. We introduce
2 = β2 ∇u2 , then (1) can be rewritten as

or iteratively by the partitioned scheme, as shown in Algorithm 2. The same order reduction
and mixed weak form are applied in [6] for an elliptic equation but in both subdomains, and
the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method instead of conforming mixed finite element method
is adopted there. Similarly, a coupled mixed finite element method in one sub-domain with a
standard finite element method in the other is developed in [15] for an elliptic problem, which,

however, intends to split a large-scale problem into multiple sub-problems through domain
decomposition, and to adopt different mixed spaces and then different well-posedness theory
for the derived saddle-point problem, moreover, there is no discussions for the jump coefficients.
Our focus in this paper is to implement the Stokes pair for an elliptic interface problem based
on the mixture scheme of standard Galerkin and mixed finite element forms divided by the
interface, which is analogous with the steady state fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem
to some extent, and investigate the influences of different jump ratios and of reduced solution
regularities upon this scheme.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we show the well-posedness of
(9) by introducing a total bilinear form and proving its inf-sup condition. The finite element
approximation of (9) is defined and analyzed in Section 3. Numerical experiments are conducted
and illustrated in Section 4, and a short summary and discussion are given in the last section
as the conclusion.

Finite Element Error Analysis

Now we consider to discretize (14) by the finite element method. Since the first two equations
in (9) are stabilized in Vdiv × L20 (Ω2 ), we can use the Taylor-Hood element to discretize them
[10]. First, we let Th = {K} be a quasi-uniform regular triangulation of the entire Ω that
fits the interface Γ by triangles of diameter at most h, Pk is the piecewise polynomial with
2 and u2
order k in each element K. Then we adopt (Pk , Pk−1 ) mixed element to discretize V
2,h ∈
in Ω2 , and Pk element to discretize the scalar variable u1 in Ω1 , resulting in u1 ∈ Wh , V

Hh , u2 ∈ Qh , defined by Wh = {w ∈ H (Ω1 ) : w|K ∈ Pk (K), ∀K ∈ Th |Ω1 , w = 0 on ∂Ω1 \Γ},
Hh = {τ ∈ Vdiv : τ |K ∈ Pk (K), ∀K ∈ Th |Ω2 }, Qh = {q ∈ L2 (Ω2 ) : q|K ∈ Pk−1 (K), ∀K ∈
Th |Ω2 , q = 0 on ∂Ω2 \Γ}. Then the finite element discretization of (14) is defined as: find

In order to show the discrete inf-sup condition of R(·, ·, ·; ·, ·, ·), we need the following discrete

Proof. With the standard analysis approach, the proof can be easily done by using the inf-sup
condition and boundedness of R(·, ·, ·; ·, ·, ·), and the general Galerkin orthogonality property
and triangular inequality, thus it is omitted here.
As introduced in [5], when the interface Γ is only Lipschitz continuous, we have a reduced
regularity result for the solution u: u1 ∈ H r (Ω1 ) and u2 ∈ H r (Ω2 ) with 32 < r ≤ 2. Therefore,
we have the following convergence theorem.

Numerical Experiments

We use the monolithic scheme to implement (18) for two cases: the immersed case and the back
to back case.

4.1

Immersed Domain Case (the left one in Fig. 1).

We choose Ω = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1], Ω2 = [−0.25, 0.25] × [−0.25, 0.25] and Ω1 = Ω\Ω2 for this case.
We take k = 2 to build finite element spaces Wh × Qh × Hh on the body-fitted mesh Th .
First, we consider the smooth-solution case with u(x, y) = (x2 −1)(y 2 −1)ex+y , which satisfies
the zero boundary condition on ∂Ω\Γ by properly choosing the right hand side function f in
(1) and the flux jump function q in (3) with different jump ratios β1 /β2 . The corresponding
numerical approximations errors based on a grid doubling are shown in Table (1) where, e1 =
2,h − V
2 div,Ω , and the convergence ”Rate”
u1,h − u1 1,Ω1 , e2 = u2,h − u2 0,Ω2 , e3 = V
2
φi,2h −φi Ωi
is computed by log2 ( φi,h −φi Ω ) (i = 1, 2) with corresponding norms. We can see that the
i
convergence rates are of second order for all e1 , e2 and e3 , which are independent of the jump
ratios, matching with our error estimates (21) with σ = 2. Here the regularity of smooth
solution u can be up to H 3 (Ωi ), i = 1, 2.

For the case of non-smooth solution, our purpose is to try to reduce the regularity of solution
and see whether the convergence rate is reduced either, as shown in our convergence theorem.
To that end, we choose q = 0, f1 = f2 = 1 and u1 |∂Ω1 \Γ = 0 with different jump ratios. Clearly,
we do not know what the true solution is, so we compute the convergence rate by comparing
φ
−φi,4h Ωi
numerical errors on three adjacent mesh levels, i.e., log2 ( φi,2h
) (i = 1, 2) with the same
i,h −φi,2h Ωi
corresponding norms. Here we still use e1 , e2 and e3 to respectively represent numerical errors
2 in H(div) norm between every two adjacent mesh
of u1 in H 1 norm, of u2 in L2 norm and of V
levels. Table (2) shows the numerical results with grid doubling, where we observe that, along
with the increasing jump ratios, the convergence rate of e1 is reduced to around first order,

and the convergence order of e3 is reduced to 0.5 ∼ 1, while that of e2 is still around of second
order. Thus the error estimate (21) is validated with σ around 0.5 ∼ 1, i.e., the regularity of
the solution u belongs to H r (Ωi ), where 23 < r ≤ 2, i = 1, 2. The superconvergence phenomena
arise from the symmetry of the structured triangulation due to the element bisection, globally.

Back to Back Domain Case (the right one in Fig. 1).

We choose Ω = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1], Ω1 = [−1, 0] × [−1, 1] and Ω2 = [0, 1] × [−1, 1] for this case.
We still consider the smooth-solution case with u(x, y) = (x2 − 1)(y 2 − 1)ex+y as we do for the
immersed domain case. For the non-smooth solution case, we let q = 0, f1 = f2 = 1, u1 |∂Ω1 \Γ =
0 and u2 |∂Ω2 \Γ = 0, in which since Γ = {(x, y)|x = 0, y ∈ [−1, 1]} that belongs to C 2 , the
solution u shall hold higher regularity than the immersed case, i.e., u ∈ H 2 (Ω1 ∪ Ω2 ).
Using the same way for the immersed domain case, we can obtain errors and convergence
rates for both smooth solution and non-smooth solution cases, as shown in Tables 3 and 4.
Similar with the immersed domain case, the smooth-solution case reaches the optimal convergence rate (second order) in all norms. As for the non-smooth solution case, we see that the
convergence rates of e1 and e2 are still of second order, but e3 reduces to first order which is
still higher than the immersed domain case due to the higher regularity of this case.

Conclusions

In this paper, we develop a mixture of standard- and mixed finite element approximations for
an elliptic interface problem with jump coefficients in both monolithic and partitioned schemes.
Then we prove the well-posedness, stability and optimal convergence theorems of the proposed
numerical method by introducing a total bilinear form to the mixed weak formulation and
analyzing its inf-sup condition, which is independent of the jump ratios. Numerical experiments
not only just validate our theoretical convergence theorem without any influence from the jump
ratios, but also show a superconvergence phenomenon due to the symmetry of the adopted
triangulation which may possess some structured features.
