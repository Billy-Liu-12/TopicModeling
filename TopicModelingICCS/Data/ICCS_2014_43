Abstract
In this paper, a one-step Steensen-type method of order 3.383 is designed and proved for solving
nonlinear equations. This super-cubic convergence is obtained by self-accelerating second-order
Steensen’s method twice with memory, but without any new function evaluations. The proposed
method is very ecient and convenient, since it is still a derivative-free two-point method. Numerical
examples confirm the theoretical results and high computational eciency.
Keywords: Nonlinear equation, Newton’s method, Steensen’s method, Derivative free, Selfaccelerating

1 Introduction
It is well-known in scientific computation that Newton’s method (NM, see [1]):
xn +1 = xn −

f ( xn )
, n = 0,1,2, ,
f ′( xn )

(1)

is widely used for root-finding, where x0 is an initial guess of the root. However, when the derivative f ′
is unavailable or is expensive to be obtained, the derivative-free method is necessary. If the derivative
f ′( xn ) is replaced by the divided difference f [ xn , xn + f ( xn )] = f ( xn + f ( xn )) − f ( xn ) in (1), Steffensen’s
f ( xn )

method (SM, see [1]) is obtained as follows:
f ( xn )
(2)
xn +1 = xn −
, n = 0,1,2, ,
f [ x, xn + f ( xn )]
NM/SM converges quadratically and requires two function evaluations per iteration. The efficiency
index of them is 2=1.414 .

Besides H.T.Kung and J.F.Traub conjectured that an iterative method based on m evaluations per
iteration without memory would arrive at the optimal convergence of order 2m−1 (see[2]), Traub
proposed a self-accelerating two-point method of order 2.414 with memory (see [3]):

where zn −1
A lot of self-accelerating Steffensen-type methods were derived in the literature (see [1-7]).
Steffensen-type methods and their applications in the solution of nonlinear systems and nonlinear
differential equations were discussed in [1, 4, 5, 8]. Recently, by a new self-accelerating technique
based on the second-order Newtonian interpolatory polynomial N 2 ( x) = f ( xn ) + f [ xn , zn −1 ]( x − xn ) +
f [ xn , zn −1 , xn −1 ]( x − xn )( x − zn −1 ) , J. Dˇzuni´c and M.S. Petkovi´c proposed a cubically convergent Steffensenlike method (see [7]):

In this study, a one-step Steffensen-type method is proposed by doubly-self-accelerating in Section
2, its super-cubic convergence is proved in Section 3, numerical examples are demonstrated in Section
4.

2 The one-step Steffensen-type method
By the first-order Newtonian interpolatory polynomial N1 ( x) = f ( xn ) + f [ xn , zn ]( x − xn ) at points xn and
zn = xn + β n f ( xn ) , we have
f ( x) = N1 ( x) + R1 ( x),

where R1 ( x) = f ( x) − N1 ( x) = f [ xn , zn , x]( x − xn )( x − zn ) . So, with some μn ≈ f [ xn , zn , x],
N2 ( x) = f ( xn ) + f [ xn , zn ]( x − xn )+μn ( x − xn )( x − zn )


should be better than N1 ( x) to approximate f ( x) . Therefore, we suggest xn +1 = xn − N 2 ( xn ) , i.e., a twoN 2′ ( xn )

parameter Steffensen’s method:
f ( xn )
(5)
, n = 0,1,2, ,
f [ xn , zn ] + μ ( xn − zn )
and {μ n } are bounded constant sequences. The error equation of (5) is

xn +1 = xn −

where zn = xn + β n f ( xn ) , {β n }
en +1 = [(1 + β n f ′(a))

f ′′( a )
2 f ′( a )

− μn β n ]en2 + O(en3 ). By

defining μ0 = 0 and μn = 1 + β n f [ xn , zn ] f [ zn −1, xn , zn ](n > 0)
β n f [ xn , z n ]

recursively as the iteration proceeds without any new evaluation to vanish the asymptotic convergence
constant, we establish a self-accelerating Steffensen’s method with super quadratic convergence as
follows:
xn +1 = xn −

f ( xn )
, n = 0,1,2, ,

f [ xn , zn ] + (1 +
)( f [ zn −1, xn ] − f [ zn −1, zn ])

Furthermore, we propose a one-step Steffensen-type method with super cubic convergence by
doubly-self-accelerating as follows:

Then, the proof can be completed.
Theorem 3.2 Let f : D → R be a suciently dierentiable function with a simple root a ∈ D ,
D ⊂ R be an open set, x0 be close enough to a , then (7) achieve the convergence of order 3.383.
Proof. If zn converges to a with order p > 1 as:
enz = Cnenp + o(enp ),
and if xn converges to a with order r > 2 as:
en +1 = Dnenr + o(enr ),

Then
enz = Cn ( Dn −1enr −1 ) p + o(enrp−1 ) = Cn Dnp−1enrp−1 + o(enrp−1 ),

en +1 = Dn (Dn −1enr −1 )r + o(enr −1 ) = Dn Dnr−1enr −1 + o(enr −1 ).

So, comparing the exponents of en −1 in expressions of enz and en +1 for (7), we obtain the same

the convergence of (7) is of order 3.383.
Without any additional function evaluations, the eciency indices of (3), (4) and (7) are
1 + 2 = 1.554, 3 = 1.732 and

3.383 = 1.839, respectively.

4 Numerical examples
Related one-step methods only using two function evaluations per iteration are showed in the
following numerical examples. The proposed method is a derivative-free two-point method with high
computational eciency.
Example 1. The numerical results of NM, SM, (3), (4) and (7) in Table 1 agree with the
theoretical analysis. The computational order of convergence is defined by

5 Conclusion
The proposed method is a derivative-free two-point method with high computational effciency. Its
convergence order is 3.383 and its effciency index is 3.383 = 1.839 . By numerical experiments, we
can see that the suggested method is suitable to solving nonlinear equations and can be used for
solving boundary-value problems of nonlinear ODEs as well. The future work can be to combine the
current method with the multiple shooting method for solving BVPs of nonlinear ODEs, since the
proposed method is a derivative-free.
