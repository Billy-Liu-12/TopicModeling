Abstract. We show that a non-bandlimited weak sense stationary stochastic process can be approximated by its local averages near the sampling points, and explicit error bounds are given.

It is well known that the Shannon sampling theorem plays an important role in
signal processing. It states that if a function f is band-limited to [−Ω, Ω], i.e.,
f ∈ IR and supp fˆ ⊂ [−Ω, Ω], where
+∞

fˆ(ω) =

f (t)e−itω dt

−∞

is the Fourier transform of f , then f can be recovered from its sampled values
at instances kπ/Ω. Speciﬁcally,
+∞

f (t) =

where sinc t = sin t/t.
Since signals are often of random characters, random signals play an important role in signal processing, especially in the study of sampling theorems. But
in many situations the assumption of band-limitation is not fulﬁlled exactly,
or the correct bandwidth is unknown. For this purpose one usually uses nonbandlimited stochastic processes which are stationary in the weak sense as a
model. We will give some new results on this topic in this paper.

Before stating the results, let us introduce some notations. Lp (IR) is the space
of all measurable functions on IR for which f p < +∞, where

u∈IR

BΩ,p is the set of all entire functions f of exponential type with type at most Ω
that belong to L2 (IR) when restricted to the real line [11]. By the Paley-Wiener
Theorem, a square integrable function f is band-limited to [−Ω, Ω] if and only
if f ∈ BΩ,2 .
Given a probability space (W, A, P) [5], a real-valued stochastic process
X(t) := X(t, ω) deﬁned on IR × W is said to be stationary in weak sense if
E[X(t)2 ] < ∞, ∀t ∈ IR, and the autocorrelation function
RX (t, t + τ ) :=

X(t, ω)X(t + τ, ω)dP (ω)
W

is independent of t ∈ IR, i.e., RX (t, t + τ ) = RX (τ ).
A weak sense stationary process X(t) is said to be bandlimited to an interval
[−Ω, Ω] if RX belongs to BΩ,p for some 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, we note that X(t) ∈ L.
Noting that any function RX ∈ BΩ,p is inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable, so the process
X(t) belongs to Lipschitz class
LipL α := {X ∈ L; ω(L, X, η) ≤ Lη α } (0 < α ≤ 1),
where ω(L, X, η) := sup X(t + h) − X(t)
|h|<η

L

is the modulus of continuity in

mean square, L > 0 is the Lipschitz constant, and X(t + h) − X(t) L =
E[(X(t + h) − X(t))2 ].

The convolution of two functions f, g ∈ L1 is deﬁned by f ∗ g(t) := √12π −∞
f (u)g(t − u)du. The convolution of a process X ∈ L and a function g ∈ L1 is
deﬁned similarly by

X ∗ g(t, ω) := √

−∞

X(u, ω)g(t − u)du.

It is not diﬃcult to check that the autocorrelation function of X ∗ g is
RX∗g = RX ∗ g ∗ g(τ ).
In 1981, Splettst¨
osser proved the following result.
Proposition 1. ([7, Theorem 2.2]) If the autocorrelation function of the weak
sense stationary stochastic process X(t, ω) belongs to BΩ,p for some 1 ≤ p ≤ 2

Proposition 2. ([7, Corollary 2.3]) If the autocorrelation function RX of the
weak sense stationary stochastic process X(t, ω) belongs to BΩ,p for some 1 ≤
p ≤ ∞, where Ω > 0, and satisﬁes
|RX (t)| = O(|t|−γ ), (|t| → ∞)

for some γ > 0. Then the sampling expansion (2) holds.
Proposition 3. ([7, Theorem 3.1]) If the weak sense stationary stochastic
process X(t, ω) is r times diﬀerentiable (in mean square sense) for some positive
integer r and with X (r) ∈ LipL α for some α ∈ (0, 1], and RX satisﬁes (3) for

For physical reasons, e.g., the inertia of the measurement apparatus, measured sampled values obtained in practice may not be values of f (t) precisely at
times tk , but only local average of f (t) near tk . Speciﬁcally, measured sampled
values are
f, uk = f (t)uk (t)dt
(5)
for some collection of averaging functions uk (t), k ∈ ZZ, which satisfy the following properties,
supp uk ⊂ [tk −

and

The local averaging method in sampling was ﬁrst studied by Gr¨
ochenig[4] in
1992. Butzer and Lei [2] also gave some interesting results on non-necessarily
bandlimited functions in 1998. Recently Sun and Zhou [9, 10] extend some classical results on irregular sampling to local average cases. They all assume that
the time intervals for averaging are symmetric. But in applications, it might not
be the case. More speciﬁcally, if we want to measure the values of f (t) at kπ/Ω,
the measurement apparatus in fact gives a weighted average over a time interval
[kπ/Ω − σk , kπ/Ω + σk ], where σk , σk are positive numbers. We assume that
σ/4 ≤ σk , σk ≤ σ/2 and that the weight functions uk are continuous, i.e,
supp uk ⊂ [tk − σk , tk + σk ],

uk (t) ≥ 0,

and

uk (t)dt = 1.

In this paper, the results on approximation of non-bandlimited weak sense
stationary stochastic process by local averages near the sampling points will
be given. By the property of the weak sense stationary stochastic process, the
assumption (3) can be replaced by
RX (t) ≤ RX (0)(1 + |t|)−γ for γ ∈ (0, 1].

The following is our results, which can be proved by the Proposition of Butzer[1],
Splettst¨osser [8], Li and Wu [5, page 291], Hausdorﬀ-Young inequality
[6, page176].
Theorem 1. If the weak sense stationary stochastic process X(t, ω) is r times
diﬀerentiable (in mean square sense) for some positive integer r, X (r) ∈ LipL α
for some α ∈ (0, 1], and RX satisﬁes (8). Then for Ω ≥ max{πe1/(γ/2+r+α), 30π},
δ ≤ 1/Ω we have
