Abstract. The object-oriented framework is developed using C++ language and
generic programming for one-dimensional river transport modelling. The set of
template classes is introduced for the better software reuse and additional ability
for libraries to be extended with new sub-models. The presented model is
developed using the new OOP framework coupled with modern third-party
linear algebra methods libraries (MTL/ITL). The classes dealing with river
topology, time series and other model elements are introduced. The new
approach makes it possible to split the task of a complex river network
simulation into a set of simple 1D branch simulations. This minimizes the
amount of code and makes program more understandable and easy to extend.
The template programming preserves high computational performance of the
system and this allows program to run as fast as its C/FORTRAN analogs.

1 Introduction
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is widely used in modelling of complex
systems. Due to abstraction introduced by OOP the development process becomes
more clear and easy [6,7,8]. At the same time using the OOP in development of
numerical models of environment is rather difficult task for modellers, as it requires
deep understating of all OO methods. The hardest task in OOP is the class
identification for the data domain. But this task becomes even harder during
decomposition of the classes which do not represent physical objects, for example
boundary conditions, numerical scheme, etc. During model software development one
of the most important facts is the computational speed and this should be taken into
account when using OOP methods. The virtual inheritance in sensitive parts of an OO
program can cause a program work much slower than its FORTRAN/C analogue. In
this article the application of the OOP methods for classes’ decomposition in
considered for establishment the efficient environment for the computational onedimensional mathematical model of pollutant transport in rivers. The OO model
actively uses generic programming, which may be called "programming with
concepts". Here a concept is defined as a family of abstractions that are all related by
a common set of requirements. In our case it can be used for example in unification of
a boundary condition definition, or algorithm for solution of equations by different
numerical schemes. Using generic programming any algorithms in the program can

be easily replaced by another one and at the same time they will be very fast because
of the compile-time polymorphism [10]. Generic algorithms are also actively used in
the last standard of the C++ language, in realization of its Standard Template Library
STL, [3]. Problem of object-oriented framework development for numerical analysis
is discussed in more general way in [1]. MTL library used in the model development
is presented in [8] and used as a linear algebra engine. The developed OO model is
implemented in the river radionuclide transport model RIVTOX [13] the EU real-time
on-line decision support system for offsite nuclear emergency management –
RODOS [14].

2 Mathematical Model
The mathematical models of the pollutant transport in rivers use as input data the
results of the modelling of the governing hydraulics processes – water surface
dynamics and currents and parameters of the suspended sediment transport [9]. For
the large scale processes, when contamination is propagated on the distances much
larger than river width in the network of the river channels, the one-dimensional
models are used. The computational problem for multi-phase pollutant in the large
network of the river channels, taking into account the boundary conditions in each
junction, can require significant computing time. The development of the efficient
algorithms and computer codes for such problem is especially important for the realtime applications. The one-dimensional radionuclide transport model RIVTOX is a
part of the real-time on-line decision support system for off-site nuclear emergency
management – RODOS [14]. It includes hydraulic submodel describing water
dynamics and suspended sediment transport and radionuclide transport submodel. The
basic approaches, assumptions and equations of RIVTOX are described in [13-15].
Here we will present only the structure of the basic equations.
RIVTOX includes two submodels for simulation crossectional averaged flow velocity
and water elevation in a network of river canals. The first one is based on the
hyperbolic system the Saint- Venant equations

where Q – water discharge A – water sectional area h – water depth, ql – water
discharge of lateral inflow, distributed along stream.
The friction slope S f is calculated using one of the empirical resistance laws, such
as Chezy’s or Manning’s:

Sf =

K = CCz A R

where K – the stream metering characteristics CCz – the empirical Chezy’s friction

here Vw is the wave propagation velocity (wave celerity), and Ewd is the diffusion

that includes a sink-source term Φ b describing sedimentation and resuspension rates
and lateral distributed inflow of VHGLPHQWV l b is a vertical sediment flux at the
bottom, describing sedimentation or resuspension processes in the dependence on the
flow dynamical parameters and size of bottom sediments.
The mathematical background of the models of pollutants transport in surface water is
also the advection – diffusion equation. Specific for radionuclide transport models –
in comparison with other water contamination models – are physical – chemical
exchange processes in the system “water – suspended sediments – bottom sediments ”
[12,13], The traditional approach in describing and predicting the fate of
radionuclides on heterogeneous solids such as soil, suspended and bottom sediments
is mainly empirical and is still based on the use of the parameterisation of simplified
adsorption- sorption kinetics in particular of the equilibrium distribution coefficients
K d = Ced / Ce , - where Ced is the amount of the contaminant adsorbed at equilibrium
on the particles (suspended or bottom sediments) , and Ce is the amount of the
contaminant left at equilibrium in solution. On the basis of the adsorption kinetics
equations using exchange rate coefficients and Kd values the sink-source terms are
constructed in RIVTOX, describing the exchange processes between the radionuclide
concentration in solute C, on suspended sediments Cs and in upper bottom layer of
the thickness Z* of the bottom sediments Cb. The system of the equation defining
these concentrations can be written in the generalized form as

And U=Q/A – the cross-section averaged velocity. The components of the sink –
source vector R are described in [13-15].
The system of the equations (5)-(7) describes each branch of the river network. The
boundary conditions in the junctions defines conservation of the fluxes of water,
sediments and radionuclides or dynamics of water elevation (Saint Venant equations
(1-2)).
2.1 Computational Methods
The hyperbolic system of the equations (1–2) are solved numerically using implicit
finite- difference scheme [16] with the special algorithmic procedure for the treatment
of the boundary conditions on the complicated graphs [9].
The advection-diffusion equations of the water, sediment and radionuclide
transport (5)-(7) are solved using a fully conservative finite-difference method with
numerical integration on the grid cell [i-1/2, i+1/2], and on the time interval [n, n+1].
The method is based on the second-order, implicit-explicit version of the MPDATA
numerical scheme [17], with the optional nonlinear Smolarkiewicz FCT limiter [18].
For all equation mixed implicit-explicit numerical scheme was applied. Boundary
condition problem for river network was solved using sweep algorithm for graphs
described in [9].

3 Object-Oriented Model
River transport model classes can be divided into three groups: first we should
consider Geographical part that describes topology of the river network. Next part is
Data classes used to specify physical parameters in the model together with data
units. Then it is necessary to introduce classes to store data as values on the river grid,
miscellaneous functions (rating curves, time series, etc.). The last part is Numerical
classes used to solve numerical equations on the river network grid; these classes
mainly represent various numerical algorithms. In [11] it is shown the integration of
object-oriented model with GIS system. Here we try to define constraints for different
equations via template parameters in order to make possible a replacement of
different numerical schemes on the fly, without losing efficiency.
On the class diagrams only the main concept classes of the program are
represented. Even without showing attributes and methods explicitly it is easy to catch
main ideas.

Fig. 1. Structure of the model library

To develop a new sub-model it is necessary just to implement several additional
classes that contain numerical equation logic. After that the classes can be utilized as
template parameters in other parts of the program. Nevertheless, during development
one should always balances between efficiency, code size and understandability.
Current version of model consists of three submodels (Fig. 1).
3.1 River Network Topology
The main class in this part is a River i.e. a container for all other spatial object such as
Node, Crosssection, etc. On the diagram (Fig. 2) an aggregation link between River
and Branch/Node classes becomes active when we define BranchModel that depends
on a numerical scheme, equation type, etc.

Fig. 2. Classes for management of the river topology and geometry

Crossection class describes a shape of cross-section in a certain location on a river. It
would be more correct to define it as a class derived from a Function and Vector as it
stores W(h), where W is a river width and h – its depth, later on in the program this

40

array is recalculated into A(h). Structure shown on a diagram is more complex in
reality, because it is necessary to redefine the algorithm of equation solving for
different structures and this should be done in a specific boundary equation. The class
Structure describes the type and parameters of the structure.
River is derived from a more general class Graph taken from the BGL (Boost Graph
Library); the later one has lots of algorithms for solution of different problems on
graphs.
3.2 Model Data Classes
Most of the data in environmental models can be described in a general way as a set
of some functional sequences. Model is able to take some parameters as an input,
simulate something and produce some results for output. Some data are set as values
on some specific model grid (properties of the bottom, cross-sections, equation
variables), some – as a common for the whole program (model parameters). Also
there can appear more specific data such as boundary conditions (time series or rating
curves).

Fig. 3. Model data classes responsible for the information about physical parameters,
substances, and state vector of some parameter/variable on the model space grid

In the framework the concept of Parameter is introduced as a class that stores
information about some physical (but not necessarily) parameter (Fig. 3). Additionally
there are Units and Substance to define data units of parameter. Substance used to
define for example “concentration of Cs-137 in the water”, so in this way it is
possible to operate with Parameter “concentration in the water” and Substance
3
identifying pollutant (“Cs-137” or other), plus Units can be set e.g. to Bq/m .
The Grid class is defined as a class built as a Vector of Cells. Later cell are defined
to store some specific information needed by the model. GridParameter class defines
value of some Parameter on a one-dimensional model grid. It is used to define values
of model variables and parameters that depend on spatial location (cell).
Development of classes for more complex grids for multi-dimensional models is
discussed in [2].

3.3 OO Numerics
To construct model of the river transport Model concept is defined as a basis for all
classes that can be started for a simulation. The RiverModel class is constructed as a
container class for BranchModel class, in this way it is possible to divide complex
task of solving equation for the whole river network into a set of solving simple onedimensional tasks on each branch.

Fig. 4. BranchModel class stores logic that is necessary to run one-dimensional model on one
branch of the river network using some numerical algorithm/equation

BranchModel is defined as it is shown on diagram (Fig. 4). At the same time
BranchModel is a model, a branch on the river and a one-dimensional grid. The class
also depends on a type of numerical equation given as a template parameter.
BranchModel links with numerical equation at the compilation time, so it does not
influence on a run speed of the program, but gives an opportunity to realize only
general methods/properties which are common for all one-dimensional models.
The model classes are based on geographical units, e.g. RiverModel (Fig. 5). The
numerical schemes are introduced as the template parameters of these classes. Using
this approach it is possible to construct any model that simulates river network in a
specific way. The Simulation is a container of model classes. It is necessary to create
links between different sub-models and develop mechanism of synchronization to
exchange data between linked sub-models. Two types of the numerical equations are
used.

Numerical scheme for this purpose is defined separately and is used independently
from equation. In fact it is hard (and even unnecessary) to separate these concepts as
they are very coupled, but we can define in numerical equation classes general
properties of equation, such as parameters, variables, general logic of solution etc.
From boundary numerical equation it is possible to build a hierarchy of all possible
combinations of boundary conditions. When we include different structures during
model application it is necessary to develop concrete classes for each structure or a
group of structures with more specific properties.

Fig. 7. Classes for internal branch numerical equations

Two types of the equations, – the hyperbolic (for water flow model) and parabolic
(advection-diffusion transport with reaction) are separated in two classes due to their
different properties (Fig. 7).
For each type of equation it is necessary to develop a numerical scheme used to
recalculate model variables on each time step. Then after developing of several
numerical schemes for one type of equations it is easy to replace them during
constructing of model objects.

4 Implementation into the Modelling System
The presented methodology is used for the development of subsystem for river
radionuclide transport modelling (RIVTOX [13]) of the EU real-time on-line
decision support system for offsite nuclear emergency management – RODOS [14].

Fig. 8. River network modelling system – RIVTOX

Model code is developed using Microsoft Visual C++ compiler and ported to
UNIX platform using GCC compiler. The graphical user interface (Fig. 8) was
developed using Motif 1.2 XWindow library and compiled using G++. The
implementation of the OO model in the RIVTOX gives possibility to diminish the
size of that code and increase it transparency. The flexibility of the approach allows
providing efficient extension of the module, e.g., the including of the data
assimilation module into the RIVTOX has been done without changing of the main
parts of the code.

5 Conclusions
The object-oriented framework is developed using C++ language and generic
programming for one-dimensional river transport modelling. Model classes are
designed in the way that produces efficient code which updating can be provided
quickly due to the clear modular structure of the framework. Model components can
be easily replaced and extended independently that gives possibility to apply and
analyse different numerical solvers, that is important for the scientific modelling. The
template programming preserves high computational performance of the system and
this allows program to run as fast as its C/FORTRAN counterparts.
