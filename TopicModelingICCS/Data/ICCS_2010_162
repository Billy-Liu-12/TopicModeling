Abstract
Over the last decades, nosocomial infections have become a major Public Health problem in hospitals worldwide. In this context,
it is very important to understand the underlying mechanisms of nosocomial pathogen transmission, in order to devise and assess
the best control strategies. Here, we present an agent-based model of pathogen transmission in a hospital ward, NosoSim. In this
model, the actions of patients and health-care workers are reproduced at all times in a spatially explicit environment, and
pathogen colonization and transmission are simulated. NosoSim allows users to define simulation parameters such as: ward
geography, including -but not limited to- the number of rooms; daily allocation and schedule of all present healthcare workers;
patient status; microbiological and epidemiological characteristics of all circulating pathogens. After describing the model and its
implementation, we illustrate its potential applications through an example addressing a real-life Public-health issue. In this
application, NosoSim is used to assess the factors which promote so-called “super-spreading events” in hospital settings.

1. Introduction
Although not a recent problem, nosocomial infections have reemerged as a major Public Health issue worldwide
over the last decades [1]. One of the main reasons for this phenomenon is that nosocomial pathogens have become
increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment. Some bacteria, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE),

vancomycin-intermediate and vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA and VRSA), and multi-drug
resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are now resistant to almost all commercially available antibiotics and have
confronted physicians with the possibility of a post antibiotic era [2].
In that context, it is of the utmost importance to gain better understanding of the mechanisms of pathogen
transmission in hospitals, as well as to be able to evaluate various control strategies. Computer modeling can help
identify factors responsible for observed patterns of occurrence. It also provides qualitative and quantitative
predictions that help understand transmission dynamics and give rise to criteria for the assessment of interventions.
Over the last 10 years, several mathematical models have been developed for studying health-care-associated
pathogens [3]. They broached a wide array of issues, including the assessment of control strategies such as antibiotic
prescribing policies [4], rapid detection and isolation strategies [5] or various hygiene measures [6], as well as the
importance of patient re-admission and moves between the general community and several health-care institutions
[7,8]. Most of these models were compartmental models, which aggregate patient and health-care worker (HCW)
populations into compartments such as colonized or uncolonized patients and contaminated or uncontaminated
HCWs. Compartmental models assume behavioral homogeneity inside compartments and homogeneous mixing
between individuals [9].
Agent-based models (ABMs), in contrast, view patients and HCWs as individual agents, and can therefore
simulate the heterogeneity of patient and HCW behavior. ABMs have been used extensively in the last decade to
simulate financial markets, car traffic, customer behavior in a supermarket or pedestrian movements such as those in
relation with a panic phenomenon [10]. They are well suited for modeling complex biological phenomena, including
the spread of infectious agents, because they account for stochasticity and for individual variations, as well as easily
integrate time and space heterogeneity [10-12]. In hospital settings, they allow for an explicit description of
individual daily schedules and moves of HCWs, as well as of individual characteristics of patients such as immune
status or drug exposure, and of specific procedures performed during visits of a given patient by a given HCW.
Here, we present an agent-based model of pathogen transmission in a geographically realistic hospital ward,
NosoSim (Nosocomial pathogens Simulation). The actions of human agents (patients and HCWs) are reproduced at
all times, as well as pathogen colonization and transmission. After describing the model and its implementation, we
illustrate its potential applications through an example. In this example, NosoSim was used to assess the impact of
HCW profile on their potential to be responsible for super-spreading events associated with nosocomial pathogens.
2. The NosoSim model
NosoSim includes two types of agents: human agents (patients and HCWs) and biological agents (pathogens and
antibiotics). For patients, key model parameters include the length of stay in the ward and the required care level
during their hospital stay. Several organizational variables are defined for HCWs. Key parameters for pathogens are
their transmissibility, the duration of human colonization and that of the conferred immunity.

2.1.2. Health-care workers (HCWs): distribution, schedule and allocation
The model includes some level of cohorting, meaning that a given number of patients (or patient rooms) are
allocated to each HCW. All HCWs included in a simulation have a profile, which determines their daily timetable,
and the duration and nature (in terms of time spent in direct contact) of their patient visits.
For each HCW profile present in the ward, the HCW to patient ratio is entered as a parameter. For instance, it is
possible to define a ”nurse” profile, according to which ”nurses” will work 8 hours shifts, with a 2:1 patient to nurse
ratio and 3 visits to each allocated patient per day, 60% of which is spent in direct contact. Table 1 depicts three
examples of HCW profiles as an illustration.

2.2. Patients
This version of NosoSim simulates an ICU-like hospital ward where patients do not move from the room they are
allocated, except for entering or leaving the ward. Rooms are supposed to be single. Only patient/HCW interactions
are modeled; in particular, HCW/HCW interactions are not modeled yet.
2.3. Pathogen colonization and transmission
The model allows for the simulation of one or several pathogens in the hospital ward. Because colonization is the
driving force behind many nosocomial epidemics, we chose to simulate colonization, rather than infection.
Colonization may be (and often is) asymptomatic; symptoms, when they occur, are not explicitely modeled.
2.3.1. Colonization of patients
Patients may be colonized with any of the pathogens that are supposed to circulate in the ward. For each
simulation, users may either select circulating pathogens from a built-in library, or define a new pathogen. For each
pathogen, the duration of colonization is entered, as well as the transmissibility and the duration of natural immunity
following decolonization.
Patients may either enter the ward already colonized or acquire colonization while they are in the ward.
Colonization is transmitted from a patient to another via the hands of HCWs. During all patient-HCW contacts,
there is a chance of colonization transmission; the transmission rate per minute of contact depends on the involved
pathogen as well as on the profile of the HCW. However, the probability of patient-to-HCW transmission is the
same as that of HCW-to-patient transmission.
Additional routes of transmission (e.g. airborne transmission) are not modeled in this version of NosoSim.
2.3.2. Colonization of HCWs
HCWs may be transiently colonized (hand carriage) with any of the pathogens that are supposed to circulate in
the ward. The duration of this transient colonization is provided for each pathogen. No immunity period follows the
end of transient colonization. HCWs acquire colonization from patients and may transmit the pathogen they are

carrying to other patients during their visits.
2.3.3. Competition between strains and multiple colonization
In simulations where several pathogens co-circulate in the ward, the model allows for multiple colonization. The
ability of two pathogens to co-colonize an individual is defined by a crossed immunity parameter which is entered
for all circulating pathogens. This parameter determines the level of protection against acquisition of a second
pathogen in already colonized individuals; it works as a multiplying factor between 0 and 1, which is applied to the
transmission probability.
2.4. Control measures
Various interventions may be implemented in NosoSim.
2.4.1. Antibiotic exposure
Antibiotics may be prescribed to patients, independently of their colonization status. Users can select one or
several antibiotics from a built-in library. For each antibiotic, a mean duration of prescription is entered, as well a
frequency of exposure in the hospital ward. Patients to which an antibiotic is prescribed are drawn at random among
all unexposed patients each morning, in order to maintain the user-defined frequency of exposure to this antibiotic in
the ward.
Bacterial pathogens may be affected by antibiotic exposure. For each circulating bacterial strain and each
antibiotic, a level of sensitivity is entered. This sensitivity determines the probability of decolonization following
antibiotic exposure.
2.4.2. Hand hygiene
HCWs may wash or rub their hands following patient contacts. In that case, hand hygiene will remove hand
carriage with a given efficacy.
2.5. Model outcomes

2.5.1. Graphical outcomes
During simulations, pathogen circulation can be followed in real-time from a schematic representation of the
hospital ward including all human agents with their location and colonization status. The prevalence of carriage
among patients and HCWs is also depicted in real-time for each circulating pathogen. After simulations, a graphical
representation of the chain of transmission provides a summary of events for each circulating pathogen.
2.5.2. Other outcomes
Several outcomes are routinely available using NosoSim, including carriage prevalence and incidence as a
function of time for each circulating pathogen. What’s more, it is rather straightforward to add other simple
outcomes to NosoSim, provided that they are built from monitored entries such as colonization transmissions and
acquisition or point prevalence.
2.6. Implementation
NosoSim is developed using the agent modeling toolkit RepastJ, the java implementation of Repast3
(http://repast.sourceforge.net/repast_3/). The java language was chosen for its interoperability, allowing the
application to run (and be developed) under Windows XP and Mac OS X. It should also work under any java 5.0
equipped operating system. The project uses the JDOM API for handling XML and Apache Derby as relational

database management system.
A free executable version of NosoSim is downloadable from the project web site:
http://sites.google.com/site/NosoSim/. The only requirement to run the project is to have a Java Runtime
Environment version 5.0 (or higher) installed. The JDOM and Derby jars are included in the project files.
3. Application example
In this section, we illustrate potential applications of NosoSim through an example [13].
3.1. Background
Epidemiological data show that many nosocomial outbreaks seem to exhibit “super-spreading events,” where
relatively few individuals are responsible for a large part of epidemic transmissions. The underlying mechanisms of
super-spreading remain unclear and may involve a combination of host, pathogen, and environmental effects.
However, increased transmission is bound to be correlated with host activities and behavior, such as hygiene
practices, frequency of bodily contacts, tendency to seek treatment, and compliance with control measures.
In this application, we examine the conditions under which individual noncompliance to hygiene measures
among HCWs may lead to super-spreading of nosocomial pathogens in a hospital ward. Using the NosoSim model,
we investigate the impact of HCW profile (in terms of daily allocation and schedule and nature of patient contacts)
on their super-spreading capacity.
3.2. Model parameters
This application was carried out in the context of an 18-bed “corridor”-type ICU (Figure 1), with 90% bed
occupancy, and a mean length of stay of 10 days. Three HCW profiles were included in the ward:
(i) Two assigned HCW profiles (AP), the first assigned HCW profile -typically a nurse- involving frequent
contacts with a limited number of patients and the second assigned HCW profile -typically a physician- involving
fewer contacts but with more patients.
(ii) One “peripatetic HCW” profile, involving a single daily contact with all patients -for instance a therapist or a
radiologist.
Each AP HCW was assigned to a specific subpopulation of patients, while peripatetic HCWs were in contact
with all patients. During his or her shift, each HCW made a fixed number of visits to each patient in his or her
specified population. For example, a nurse had 3 daily contacts with 2 different patients. Characteristics of HCW
profiles and their daily schedule and allocation are reported in Table 1.
3.2.1. Circulating pathogens
The circulation of a bacterial pathogen was simulated following the introduction of a single colonized patient in
the ICU. The ward was supposed previously free from the studied pathogens, for which we investigated a range of
transmissibilities, based on data on MRSA and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE).
3.2.2. Hygiene Measures: Efficacy and Compliance.
Following patient contacts, HCWs could apply standard hand hygiene procedures, which were 90% efficient at
removing transient colonization. From 0 to 5 of all HCWs were supposed noncompliant with hand hygiene
recommendations. All possible scenarios were investigated regarding the profile of the noncompliant HCWs among
the staff.
HCWs who were fully compliant washed their hands following every patient contact. Those who were not
compliant never washed their hands.

Fig. 2. Total number of patients colonized over 1 month following a single index case (on a log-scale), as a function of the number of
noncompliant HCWs. A range of transmissibilities are investigated for the pathogen, from low (dotted line) to high (full line). Lines provide the
mean of outbreak sizes computed for all possible scenarios regarding the identity of noncompliant HCWs among the staff. Error bars provide the
minimum and maximum among these outbreak sizes.

3.3. Results

3.3.1. Impact of Noncompliance on Pathogen Transmission.
Fig. 2 provides the predicted total number of colonized patients (outbreak size) over 1 month according to the
number of noncompliant HCWs. When all HCWs were compliant, from 1.5 to 5.8 patient cases were predicted over
1 month, depending on pathogen transmissibility. As expected, outbreak size increased with noncompliance; for a
single noncompliant HCW, it reached 1.7 to 6.8 patient cases on average over 1 month (a 13 to 17% increase).
These results were highly dependent on the profile of the noncompliant HCW, as the increase ranged from 2 to 7%
for a noncompliant physician and from 73 to 238% for a noncompliant peripatetic HCW.
3.3.2. Importance of the HCW Profile.
Fig. 3 depicts the predicted outbreak size over 1 month with the hypothesis of a single noncompliant HCW
(assigned or peripatetic HCW). The impact of noncompliance was strongest when the peripatetic HCW was
noncompliant; the HCW profile was most important for a highly transmissible pathogen. Indeed, the predicted total
number of patients colonized over 1 month with the highest investigated transmissibility was approximately 3 times
greater with 1 noncompliant peripatetic HCW than with 1 noncompliant assigned HCW (Fig. 3B).
3.4. Conclusions
This application shows that systematic noncompliant behavior in a few HCWs may have more impact than a
global reduction in compliance in all HCWs. This predicted individual impact should be strongest when the
noncompliant individuals are peripatetic HCWs. Peripatetic HCWs appear to have major superspreading potential,
especially when the transmitted pathogen is highly epidemic. Our findings may explain several reports of outbreaks
that were traced back to peripatetic HCWs [14-16].
Peripatetic HCWs, which we defined as HCWs who pay a single (possibly short) visit to all patients in the ICU
daily, can be found among many professions represented in ICUs. Some examples are radiologists and physical
therapists or other therapists but also physicians on night duty, staff heads, and so on. What is more, it should be

noted that in conditions of understaffing or overcrowding of the ward, HCWs who usually belong in the assigned
HCW category may also become peripatetic (noncohorted) HCWs.
4. Discussion
In this paper, we present a tool for simulating pathogen transmission in hospitals and evaluating intervention
strategies. Through an application example, we show that this tool may prove useful for addressing important Public
Health issues related to the nosocomial risk.
Because it uses the agent-based framework, NosoSim allows the modeling of stochastic events and
heterogeneous individual behaviors in a heterogeneously mixed environment. Despite its applicability for the
problem at hand, however, agent-based modeling still has some drawbacks. In particular, since it describes the
system at the level of its constituent units but not at the top level, its computational demand (at medically relevant
scales in terms of simulation durations, number of rooms, etc.) is significant. For instance, performing 1000
simulations of the circulation of two strains in competition in an 18-bed ”corridor-type” ICU (application 1) may
take up to 12 minutes with NosoSim running on an Intel Core Duo 2GHz processor.
We developed NosoSim to be flexible, in the sense that modifying and/or adding to any aspect of the simulated
hospital ward, human and bacterial agents, should be straightforward. Nevertheless, some actions, such as defining
and using a new geographical description for the hospital ward, still necessitate direct modifications in the core Java
classes of the program. This should be ameliorated in future versions of NosoSim; a graphical interface allowing to
“draw” directly the new hospital ward is planned among further developments.

Future versions should also feature more realistic modeling regarding several aspects which are overly simplified
here. This includes interactions (and possible pathogen transmission) between HCWs; interactions of patients and
HCWs with the outside world; pathogen transmission through the environment (bedside rails, blood pressure cuffs,
etc.) and airborne pathogen transmission.
We are also planning on offering a wider array of interventions that may easily be used (and parameterized)
during simulations. Possible interventions include: systematic detection of individuals colonized with a list of
pathogens at arrival; periodic surveillance of colonization among patients; use of 1 or several isolation rooms for
colonized patients.
Finally, we endeavor to add as many bacterial pathogens and antibiotics to the corresponding built-in libraries as
possible, so that NosoSim users need simply select them rather than having to re-define all of their properties. We
also plan on using NosoSim to investigate the dynamics of viral pathogens that circulate in hospitals, such as SARS
or influenza.
