Abstract
In this study, application of Level Set method in modeling incompressible immiscible two-phase ﬂows for some benchmark
problems such as rising bubble and bursting bubble at the free surface is explained. Derivations of Level Set function and convective terms are done using ﬁfth order Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) scheme. It is observed that Level Set
method is very successful in modeling two-phase ﬂows, especially in handling topological changes like bubble skirt pinching
oﬀ and merging of bubble with the free surface.
Keywords: Level Set Method; Interface Modeling; Two-Phase Flows.

1. Introduction
Movement of clouds in the air, melting of the ice, fuel combustion in engine, boiling phenomenon in reactors,
die casting of metals, solidiﬁcation process in metallurgy and many other phenomena are just few examples of
multiphase ﬂows that happen in our daily lives and also in many important engineering and industrial applications.
Therefore, analyzing of such these ﬂows have a great importance. Although experimental analysis gives more realistic, accurate and reliable results, high costs of preparing experimental setups and time consuming experiments
make less accurate but faster and more economic numerical methods preferable for many researchers in this ﬁeld.
In order to deﬁne material properties for each phase in the ﬂow ﬁeld, it is required to deﬁne an interface, which
seperates diﬀerent phase ﬁelds, and follow its evolution during the whole simulation. To this end, the Level Set
function is applied.
2. Level Set Methodology
In order to model multiphase ﬂows, it is required to deﬁne an interface and follow its evolution in entire
domain. In Level Set method (LSM) [1, 2, 3], this interface is represented by zero level set of a continuous
function such that,

To avoid having Level Set function be too steep or too ﬂat, φ(x, t), is set to be a distance function φ(x, t) = d(x, t) =
min(|x − xI |), where xI shows the position of points on the interface and d(x, t) determines the distance of other
points to the nearest points on the interface, i.e, d(x, t) = (x − xI )2 + (y − yI )2 + (z − zI )2 and |∇φ(x, t)| = 1. This
Level Set function is called signed distance function.
Geometric properties of the interface such as normal vector, n, and curvature, κ, can be easily calculated using
∇φ
and κ = ∇ · n. Propagation of φ(x, t) is done by solving Level Set equation,
Level Set function, φ, i.e, n = |∇φ|
∂φ
∂t

+ Fn |∇φ| = 0, in which Fn is a speed function normal to the interface and it varies depending on many factors
such as the geometry of the problem, local curvature (κ), underlying velocity ﬁeld that transports the interface, etc.
For example, in the case of two-phase incompressible ﬂuid ﬂows, the speed function is the vlocity ﬁeld solved
∇φ
, Level Set equation is
from Navier-Stokes equations. Therefore, Fn is turned to be Vn = V · N and since N = |∇φ|
changed to
∂φ
+ V · ∇φ = 0
∂t

The obtained level Set function (φ) from equation(2) is not a signed distance function anymore. To avoid this
situation, a so-called re-initialization step must be performed, in which the current level set function is replaced
by a smoother and less distorted function which has the same zero level-set. The procedure is as the following:
dτ + sign(φ)(|∇d| − 1) = 0

With initial value d(x, 0) = φ(x). Where φ(x) is the level Set function calculated from equation (2).
There are many variants of molliﬁed signum function (sign(φ) ), one of them is due to Sussman et al.[3]

In this study, sign(φ) is calculated due to equation suggested by Peng. The equation (3) is evolved untill meeting
the steady state condition. Moreover, ∇φ in equation (2) is calculated using Weighted Essentially Non Oscillatory
(WENO) scheme [5]
3. Governing Equations
In this study, 2 − D ﬂuid motion is considered. Behaviour of the ﬂuids is governed by the incompressible
Navier-Stokes equations deﬁned in the domain Ω = Ω1 ∪ Ω2 ∪ Γ f , where Ω1 denotes ﬂuid phase 1 and Ω2 denotes
ﬂuid phase 2 and Γ f = ∂Ω1 ∩ ∂Ω2 is the interface between two ﬂuid phases:

Where i ∈ 1, 2 and material derivative, Du

S i := ∇ui + {∇ui } . The surface tension boundary condition at the interface is given by:

(T 1 − T 2 ).n = σκn

(10)

Where T i = −pi + μi S i denotes the stress tensor, σ is the surface tension coeﬃcient, κ is the local curvature,
and n denotes the surface normal on Γ f . Furthermore, the velocity must be continuous across the free surface,

i.e., u1 = u2 on Γ f . In order to solve equation (6) simoltaneously for both ﬂuid 1 and ﬂuid 2, it is required to
redﬁne ﬂuid properties, ρ and μ, as φ-dependant variables as the following, where H ε denotes smoothed Heaviside
function and δε (φ) is the associated smoothed delta functional. In this way, ﬂuid properties vary smoothly across
the interface of thickness ε, which is set to 1.5dx in this paper.

Using continuum surface force (CSF) approach [6], surface tension boundary condition (10) is included in momentum equation (6) as a force term. By applying projection method [7], the following equations are obtained

4. Results
Two diﬀerent test cases, rising bubble and bursting bubble at the free surface are considered in order to show
the ability of LSM in capturing moving interfaces. In the ﬁrst test case, rising gas bubble in a surrounding liquid
is considered. This is a well known and very important problem in multiphase ﬂows for those dealing with bubbly
ﬂows. The Level Set function is deﬁned as φ = (x − xc )2 + (y − yc )2 − R. The lighter gas bubble experiences
shape changes while it is rising due to buoyancy forces. The computational domain for Rising Bubble test case
is set to (0; 1) × (0; 2) and the initial shape of bubble is supposed to be a circle with center (0.5, 0.5) and radius
R = 0.25. Free-slip and no-slip boundary conditions are imposed to vertical and horizontal walls respectively.
Density and viscosity ratios are ρ1 /ρ2 = 1000 and μ1 /μ2 = 100 respectively. Reynolds number is set to Re = 700
and Eotvos number is set to, Eo = 500. The shape changes that bubble experiences during its elevation is depicted
in ﬁgure (1-a) . Computations are done in 80 × 160 rectangular grid. Since Eotvos number is relatively high,

bubble will catch the skirted shape as time goes on. In high Reynolds numbers as in this test case, vortices that
are created in the wake of bubble cause more intense circulations that leads to seperation of bubble skirts.
In the next test case, in order to show the ability of LSM in handling topological changes like merging of
two interfaces, bursting bubble at the free surface problem is considered. In this case, bubble rises until it meets
and merges with the free surface. Same as previous test case, Reynolds number, density and viscosity ratios
are Re = 700, ρρ12 = 1000, μμ12 = 100. Initially, free surface is located at y s = −0.2, bubble has a radius of
R = 0.125, its center is located at (xc , yc ) = (0, −0.35). The Level Set function is deﬁned by deﬁning two functions
φ1 = (x − xc )2 + (y − yc )2 − R, φ2 = y s − y and taking the minimum of them φ = min(φ1 , φ2 ).In this case, surface
tension eﬀects are neglected. It is observed that a ﬂuid jet is formed after bubble merges with the free surface
because of high pressure diﬀerence that occurs at a very small region as depicted in Figure (1-b).
5. Conclusion
Immiscible incompressible two-phase ﬂows have been considered and results for some test cases, such as rising
bubble and bursting bubble at the free surface, are presented. The interface, which seperates two diﬀerent phases,
is captured using LSM in which there is no need to reconstruct the interface after each time step and topological
changes like merging or pinching oﬀ phenomena handled automatically. However, it has been observed that the
mass (or area) conservation is not that much satisfactory, which is the only drawback of this method.
