Abstract
Computational problems in medicine often require a researcher to apply diverse skills in confronting problems involving very large data sets, three-dimensional complex geometries which must be modeled and visualized, large scale computing, and hefty amounts of numerical analysis. In this talk I will present recent
research results in computational neuroscience, imaging, and cardiology. I will
provide examples of several driving applications of steering and interactive visualization in cardiology (deﬁbrillation simulation and device design), neuroscience
(new inverse source localization techniques), and imaging (new methods for interactive visualization of large-scale 3D MRI and CT volumes, and introduce
new methods for diﬀusion tensor imaging).
