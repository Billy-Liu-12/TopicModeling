Abstract. Emerging microarray technologies allow genotyping of long
genome sequences resulting in huge amount of data. A key challenge is to
provide an accurate phasing of very long single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) sequences. In this paper we explore phasing of genotypes with 2
SNPs adjusted to the non-random mating model and then apply it to
the haplotype inference of complete genotypes using maximum spanning
trees. The runtime of the algorithm is O(nm(n + m)), where n and m
are the number of genotypes and SNPs, respectively. The proposed phasing algorithm (2SNP) can be used for comparatively accurate phasing
of large number of very long genome sequences. On datasets across 79
regions from HapMap[7] 2SNP is several orders of magnitude faster than
GERBIL and PHASE while matching them in quality measured by the
number of correctly phased genotypes, single-site and switching errors.
For example, 2SNP requires 41 s on Pentium 4 2Ghz processor to phase
30 genotypes with 1381 SNPs (ENm010.7p15:2 data from HapMap) versus GERBIL and PHASE requiring more than a week of runtime and
admitting no less errors than 2SNP. 2SNP software is publicly available
at http://alla.cs.gsu.edu/∼software/2SNP.

Introduction

The diﬀerence between individual DNA sequences mostly occurs at a single-base
site, in which more than one nucleic acid or gap is observed across the population. Such variations are called single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The
number of suﬃciently frequent SNPs in the human population is estimated to
be around 10 million [11]. For complex diseases caused by more than a single
gene it is important to identify a set of alleles inherited together. Identiﬁcation
of haplotypes, the sequences of alleles in contiguous SNP sites along a chromosomal region, is a central challenge of the International HapMap project [7].
The number of simultaneously typed SNPs for association and linkage studies is
reaching 250,000 for SNP Mapping Arrays (Aﬀymetrix).
Diploid organisms, like human, have two near-identical copies of each chromosome. Most experimental techniques for determining SNPs do not provide

the haplotype information separately for each of the two chromosomes. Instead,
they generate for each site an unordered pair of allele readings, one from each
copy of the chromosome,which is called a genotype.
The input to the phasing problem consists of n genotype vectors each with
m coordinates corresponding to SNPs.The phasing problem asks for explaining
each genotype with two haplotypes corresponding to chromosomes. In general as
well as in common biological setting, there are 2k−1 of possible haplotype pairs
for the same input genotype with k heterozygous sites.
Computational inferring of haplotypes from the genotypes (or phasing) has
been initiated by Clark[2] who proposed a parsimony-based approach. It has
been shown later that the likelihood based expectation-maximization (EM) is
more accurate [13]. Markov chain Bayesian haplotype reconstruction methods
have been used in PHASE [14] and HAPLOTYPER [12]. A combinatorial model
based on the perfect phylogeny tree assumption was suggested in [5]. HAP [6]
exploits perfect phylogeny model and block structure showing good performance
on real genotypes with low error rates. Recently, GERBIL [10] has combined
block identiﬁcation and phasing steps for reliable phasing of long genotypes.
In this paper we ﬁrst explore phasing of genotypes with 2 SNPs which have
ambiguity when the both sites are heterozygous. Then there are two possible
phasing and the phasing problem is reduced to inferring their frequencies. Given
phasing solution for 2-SNP genotypes, complete haplotypes for a given genotype
can be inferred based on the maximum spanning tree of a complete graph with
vertices corresponding to heterozygous sites and edge weights given by inferred
2-SNP frequencies. In tests on real datasets across 79 diﬀerent genomic regions
from HapMap [7] 2SNP was several orders of magnitude faster than GERBIL
and PHASE while matching them in quality. We also found that HAPLOTYPER
is almost as fast as 2SNP and close in quality, but currently does not handle
populations with more than 500 SNPs. A brief description of 2SNP software can
be found in the application note [1].
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes proposed 2-SNP genotypes phasing. Section 3 describes the phasing of long genotypes using 2-SNP genotypes phasing. Section 4 describes tested datasets and
deﬁnes phasing accuracy measures and compares the quality and runtime of
PHASE, GERBIL, HAPLOTYPER and 2SNP algorithms.

Phasing of 2-SNP Genotypes

In this section we ﬁrst formally introduce the phasing problem and suggest a
LD-based formula for the expected frequencies of cis- or trans-phasing of 2-SNP
genotypes. We conclude with adjusting of expected haplotype frequencies to
deviation from the random mating model.
The input to the phasing problem consists of n genotype vectors each with m
coordinates corresponding to SNPs. SNP values belong to {0, 1, 2, ?}, where 0’s
and 1’s denote homozygous sites with major allele and minor allele, respectively;
2’s stand for heterozygous sites, and ?’s denote missed SNP values. Phasing

replaces each genotype vector by two haplotype vectors with SNP values in
{0, 1} such that any genotype 0-SNP (resp. 1-SNP or 2-SNP) is replaced with two
haplotype 0-SNPs (resp. two 1-SNPs or 0-SNP and 1-SNP). A 2-SNP genotype
22 can be cis-phased, i.e., represented as 00 and 11 haplotypes, or trans-phased,
i.e. represented as 01 and 10 haplotypes.
Certainty of cis- or trans- phasing.It is natural for the certainty of cis- or
trans- phasing of homozygous SNPs i and j to take in account odds ratio of phas00 ×F11
ing being cis- or trans-, which is λ = F
F01 ×F10 where F00 , F01 , F10 , F11 are unknown
true frequencies of haplotypes with the ﬁrst and the second binary index denoting alleles of the i-th and j-th SNP, respectively. In our experiments, we have no00 +F11
ticed that the modiﬁed odds ratio λ = F
F01 +F10 better describes real cis- or transphasing. We measure LD (linkage disequilibrium) between endpoints by the ratio of the modiﬁed odds ratio λ over the expected value of λ computed in asλ
sumption of no linkage between endpoints, LDij = exp(λ
) . Finally, it has been
observed[12, 13, 10] the higher LD between pairs of closer SNPs. In order to discard falsely encountered LD between non-linked SNPs which are far apart, we dilog LD
vide LD by the square of the distance between the SNPs obtaining cij = (i−j)2ij .
The complete formula for the certainty of cis- or trans-phasing of two homozygous
SNPs i and j is logarithm of linkage disequilibrium for the cis-/trans- odds ratio
divided by squared distance between corresponding SNPs.
cij = log

n + (F00 F11 − F01 F10 )/(F01 + F01 )

where n is number of input genotypes, and F00 , F01 , F10 , F11 are frequencies of
haplotypes with the ﬁrst and the second binary index denoting alleles of the i-th
and j-th SNP, respectively. Haplotype frequencies are computed based on all
genotype frequencies except 22. For 22 genotypes, the haplotype frequencies are
chosen to ﬁt best Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium adjusted to observed deviation
in single-site genotype distribution.
Adjusting observed frequencies to deviations from the random mating model. The certainty formula (1) cannot be directly used in phasing since
the participating haplotype frequencies are true frequencies and, therefore, are
unknown. We have access only to observed haplotype frequencies which can be
extracted from all types of 2-SNP genotypes except 22, genotypes heterozygous
in the both SNPs.
The distribution of cis- and trans-phasing of 22-genotypes can be adjusted to
the unknown mating model as follows. Let C22 and P22 denote unknown numbers
of tarns- and cis- phasings, then C22 + P22 = G22 , where G22 is the observed
number of 22-genotypes. Then the adjusted odds ratio λ can be expressed as
∗
F ∗ +F11
+P22
λ = F 00
where Fij∗ denote haplotype frequencies observed from all
∗
∗
01 +F10 +C22
genotypes except 22. The best-ﬁt values of C22 and P22 should minimize the sum
of diﬀerences between expected and observed genotype frequencies. It is easy to
compute the expected genotype frequencies for the random mating model, which
unfortunately can signiﬁcantly deviate from the real mating. Unknown for pairs

770

of SNPs, such deviation can be accurately measured for individual SNPs. In
our algorithm, we assume that the deviation for pairs of SNPs is similar to the
deviation observed for the corresponding single SNP. Therefore, the expected 2SNP frequencies are adjusted proportionally to the observed single-site deviation.

3

Phasing of Complete Genotypes

Below we describe phasing of long genotype using certainty of cis- or transphasing between any pairs of 2’s computed in the previous section. We then
explain how we resolve missing data recovery and conclude with runtime analysis
of the 2SNP algorithm.
Genotype Graph. For each genotype g, 2SNP constructs a genotype graph,
which is a complete graph with vertices corresponding to 2’s (i.e., heterozygous
sites) of g. The weight of the edge between heterozygous sites i and j represents
the certainty (formula 1) in that i and j are cis- or trans-phased. The maximum
spanning tree of the genotype graph uniquely determines the phasing of the corresponding genotype since it gives cis-/trans- phasing for any two 2’s. Obviously,
if for any pair of 2’s we know if they are cis- or trans-phased, then the entire
phasing is known. Note that [10] have applied the same construction for preliminary estimation of haplotype frequencies rather than phasing per se. Therefore,
for the edge weight, they have chosen LD-based formula over probabilities of full
(i-j)-haplotypes given by maximum-likelihood solution. Instead, edge weights in
2SNP do not account for SNPs between i and j.
Missing Data Recovery. Missing data (?’s) are recovered after phasing of 2’s.
For each haplotype h we ﬁnd the closest (w.r.t. Hamming distance) haplotype(s)
h and recover ?’s in h with the corresponding values from h .
Runtime 2SNP Algorithm. The runtime of 2SNP algorithm has two bottlenecks. The ﬁrst is computing of the observed haplotype frequencies for each pair
of SNPs, which takes O(nm2 ) since we have n genotypes each with m SNPs. The
second is recovering of the missing data, which needs O(n2 m) runtime since it results in computing all pairwise Hamming distances between 2n haplotypes each
with m SNPs. As a result, the total runtime of the algorithm is O(nm(n + m)),
where n and m are the number of genotypes and SNPs, respectively.

Results

In this section we ﬁrst describe the datasets and quality measures. Then, we
compare our 2SNP method with PHASE-2.1.1[14], HAPLOTYPER[12] and
GERBIL[10].
Data Sets. The comparison of phasing methods were performed on 46 real
datasets from 79 diﬀerent genomic regions and on 4 simulated datasets. All real
datasets represent family trios – the computationally inferred oﬀspring haplotypes for oﬀspring have been compared with haplotypes inferred from parental
genotypes.

Error measures. A single-site error[15] is the percent of erroneous SNPs among
all SNPs in phased haplotypes. An individual error[12] is the percent of genotypes
phased with at least one error among all genotypes. A switching error[10] is the
percent of switches (among all possible switches) between inferred haplotypes
necessary to obtain a true haplotype. For each dataset we bootstraped phasing
result 100 times, and for each bootstrap sample we computed an error. The 95%
conﬁdence interval for the error mean was computed based on the 100 error
values.
Comparison of phasing methods. Table 1 shows performance of four phasing
methods on real datasets, and Table 2 shows the performance for simulated
datasets. All runs were performed on computer with Intel Pentium 4, 2.0Ghz
processor and 2 Gigabytes of Random Access Memory. HAPLOTYPER was
run with 20 rounds and the 2.1.1 version of PHASE was run with the default
parameters. The ∗-marked switching error is 2.9% for the earlier version PHASE2.0.2. The dashes in HAPLOTYPER columns correspond to the cases when it
does not output valid phasing.
The tables show that 2SNP is several orders of magnitude faster than two
other phasing methods handling large datasets in a matter of seconds. The reported mean errors with the respective 95% conﬁdence intervals show that GERBIL, PHASE, and 2SNP have the same accuracy for real data (Chromosome
5q31, Yoruba(D), HapMap datests). On the other hand, 2SNP and GERBIL
are considerably outperformed by PHASE and HAPLOTYPER on some simulated data (Random matching 5q31). Poor performance of 2SNP can be caused
by the absence of deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium observed on

real data. For the mixed populations one can see deterioration of all phasing
methods.
In conclusion, we have presented a new extremely fast and simultaneously
highly accurate phasing algorithm 2SNP based on 2-SNP haplotypes. We hope
that it will be very useful for high-throughput genotype data processing, e.g.,
SNP Mapping Arrays (Aﬀymetrix). We are going to extend our method by
applying 3-SNP haplotype analysis.
