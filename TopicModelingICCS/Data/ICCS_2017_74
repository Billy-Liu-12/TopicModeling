In crowd evacuations there are random patterns among the public, therefore we need statistically reliable results in order to predict with reliability. For that, it is important to use high
performance computational solutions and tools. Care HPS [4] is an Agent-Based Model tool
that helps to execute experiments in a parallel and distributed architecture.
Therefore, in this paper, we use as a case study Fira of Barcelona model based on the Helbing
model [6]. Fira model, implemented in C++, and simulated using Care HPS [4]. We analyzed
the behavior of the model and how this tool carry on crowd evacuation models. This gives us
more statistically reliable results. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We present
related works where we show previous crowd evacuation models 2. Then we dedicate Section
3 to show the challenges of crowd evacuation simulation and to present Fira crowd evacuation
model. Care HPS [4], tool used for implement and simulate the Fira of Barcelona model, is
presented in Section 4. Then, the model experiments and the improvements on Care HPS are
presented and discussed in Section 5; and finally, some conclusions are drown in Section 6.

Related Work

The modeling of movement patterns of human crowds at the exit point of an enclosed space is
a complex and challenging problem. An analytic study of crowd dynamics through exits may
provide useful information for crowd control purposes. Proper understanding of the evacuation
dynamics will allow, for example, improvements of designs of pedestrian facilities.
There are three main reasons for developing computer simulations for crowd behaviors:
firstly, to test scientific theories and hypotheses; secondly, to test design strategies; and finally,
to recreate the phenomena about which to theorize [8].
In the area of HPC to solve crowd problems, GPUs have been used to implement the
crowd dynamics algorithm and the rendering [3]. Also crowd turbulence phenomena integrated
on GPU cards [2], The implementation is a hybrid model between Verlet integration method
and Agent Based Model. MPI was used in city evacuations distributing the space and agents
[7]. These tools are normally tested with hundreds of individuals. Many crowd evacuation
models using agent based model simulated people behavior by deploying cloud services for high
performance simulation [1].
In this literature study, we note the need for further contributions in parallel and distributed
solutions to carry out models with thousands of people. Also, tools can easily change the
environment characteristics in order to simulate better layouts of space for fastest evacuations.

Crowd Evacuation Model

Modeling has allowed the humanity to advance its knowledge and improve its day living. All
modelling approaches differ on the focus of how to extract the natural characteristics of the
reality and how to implement them. Each approach has pros and cons, and choosing one or
another is always a trade-off. Simulators implement the ideas designed by models. Simulation
allows us to interact with the model and generate results without interacting with the real
system.
In our case model and simulator have mainly the purpose of provide knowledge of potential
problems also analyze theories and simulate them. Moreover, one of the main final goals is to
provide a decision support system where the complexity of the model and the performance is
hidden to the final user by integrating the crowd evacuation model with Care HPS tool.

Our present model is a discrete time model able to handle thousands of agents, whereas
the model recovers ideas from Cellular Automata to be computationally efficient. This model
reproduces crowd phenomena in Salón del Manga, which is the building 2 of Fira de Barcelona.
And it can hold almost a hundred thousands of people. This environment has different zones
and obstacles, which make the evacuation more complex.
The model is divided into two sub-models, agent and environmental intelligence. And
the agent move between cells approaching to the exit, while there can be only one agent per
cell, and when agents achieve the exit, they are released. The model is described by a set of
attributes, which are (A1: Stopped, A2: Moving, A3: Evacuated, N: Approaching the exit, E:
Exit reached, F: Free patch), and transitions between states are determined by the attributes of
the model. The algorithm used for the environment sub-model is the potential field algorithm,
which provides the shortest path and support obstacle avoidance feature. This algorithm is a
recursive algorithm that visits the cells in breadth search giving higher values every time.
The model and Care HPS tool implemented in C++ programming language, To test the
model with Care HPS, we distributed the simulations using MPI, while the simulator were
executed for several configurations with 0-64 OpenMP threads and 2-64 cores, also we used
different partitioning strategies.

Care HPS

Care High Performance Simulation (HPS) [4], is a scientific instrument that enables researchers
to: 1) develop techniques and solutions of high performance distributed simulations for agentbased models; and, 2) study, design and implement complex agent-based models that require
HPC solutions. Care HPS was designed to easily and quickly develop new agent-based models.
It was also designed to extend and implement new solutions for the main issues of parallel and
distributed solutions.
Care HPS act as a tool that allows the development of studies in different approaches for
several problems in these areas. This means that new approaches can be verified without
changes in its kernel or huge programming efforts. In Care HPS, users can attach their ABM
and HPC solutions to the kernel of Care HPS by using interfaces. The user might implement
their ABM, partitioning, communication, synchronization and other HPC solutions, then attach
their solutions to the kernel of Care HPS.
As examples of use, user can test to see which partitioning technique offer the best performance for a specific ABM; or, user can analyze and study a new proposed algorithm of
synchronization using ABMs which require different computational characteristics.
In this paper we explore Fira crowd evacuation model over Care HPS.

Experiments

In this section, we will present the experiments conducted over Fira of Barcelona model.
The first experiment was carried out for 15000 and 39000 agents, and, it was executed using
one MPI processes and n threads were created. We used the hybrid strip partitioning, This
partitioning is one of the partitioning available in Care HPS, where we use MPI and OpenMP
threads to simulate agents behaviors.
The best execution time found was with eight threads for both number of agents. Where
the simulation time for 15K agents was 1317 seconds and the simualtion time for 39K agents
was 5587 seconds with 8 threads. As we note, the total execution time increased and it occurs

because the model has a limited number of exits and all agents look up for these exits. Therefore,
increasing the number of cores does not decrease the execution time, because of the access to
exits is sequential and computing of the stopped agents is not too high.
Also we found the best speedup with 8 and 16 cores and the best efficiency we obtained
are for 2, 4 and 8 cores. As we notice from these results, the model can not take advantage of
increasing the number of cores because of the reason noted at first experiment. Regardless of
eight cores bring the lowest total execution time.
Simulation of crowd evacuation requires fast single execution to be able to execute many
times and return reliable data. Therefore, in the next experiment, we executed the model in
two MPI processes and we used several partitioning approaches available in Care HPS [5, 4] in
order to create separate memory context and evaluate the best partitioning approach for this
type of model. Figure 1 presents the total execution time for four strip partitioning approaches:
HF - it creates partitions with horizontal cut, VF - it creates partitions with vertical cut. HF
and VF take into account the position of object in the environment and avoiding that an object
becomes shared with different MPI processes.
Both approaches HFB and VFB were included in Care HPS after analyses preliminary data
of simulation. These data showed that some cores was getting idle because the partitioning
approaches HF and VF were creating partition with size completely different, while one of
them is very huge and the another one is too small. It happened because of these partitioning
tried to find empty space between the obstacle in order to avoid sharing the objects. Therefore
we observed that these built in partitioning approaches were not appropriated for Fira model.
Thus, we included these new two approaches in Care HPS to carry out this type of model.
Figure 1 shows the total execution time for 39000 agents executed at 8 cores using different
partitioning approaches. The proposed approaches HFB and VFB give better execution time.
With aim of analyzing more these approaches, we executed the Fira model with in 8, 16 and
32 cores using hybrid partitioning and simulating 39000 agents. As result, we obtained 3198.7
seconds as the best execution time for HFB approach and 3567.97 seconds as the best execution
time for VFB approach. These time were obtained by executing in 16 (HFB) and 8 (VFB) cores.
It means that the speedup and efficiency for HFB is 7.62 and 47.60%. On the other hand, VFB
approach presents 6.83 and 85.35% as speedup and efficiency. Therefore, taking into account
the parallel computing measures future optimization of model must be conducted over VFB
strategy and execution using 8 cores. In spite of HFB approach with 16 brings lower total
execution time.

Conclusions

In this paper we presented an evacuation case study using Care HPS. The aim of the paper is to
show how Care HPS can be useful for this type of problems. Simulation of evacuation has two
main requirement: i) faster execution in order to get reliable data through many executions of
same model; and ii) it requires easiness to re-configure the environment in order to change the
position of obstacle and the exits in the reality. This reconfiguration can help decision makers
to decide according to the time required to evacuate a certain number of people.
For improvement the performance of this model, we implemented the following features in
Care HPS: i) support rectangle object to represent the obstacle of Fira; ii) we changed the strip
partitioning to divide the environment without considering the position of object and create
same partition size, therefore we proposed two new partitioning approaches in Care HPS; Also
iii) support creating ”N” static threads.
Through the experimentation, we found the best partitioning strategy and number of cores
for a huge number of agents 39000 in Fira model using Care HPS. Also, we figured out that
crowd evacuation problem has bottlenecks in the reality. It occurs because of agents dispute
the few exits, same way that occurs in the reality. When this behavior is modeled, it must be
implemented as a sequential access therefore it avoids a better gain of execution time when the
solution is parallelization.
