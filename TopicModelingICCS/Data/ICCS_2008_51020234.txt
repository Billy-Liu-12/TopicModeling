Abstract. We present multiscale simulations of liquid water using a novel
control algorithm to couple non-periodic molecular dynamics (MD) and
continuum descriptions in the context of a Schwarz alternating method.
In the present multiscale approach the non-periodic MD simulations are
enhanced by an eﬀective external boundary force that accounts for the virial component of the pressure and eliminates spurious density oscillations
close to the boundary. This force is determined by a simple control algorithm that enables coupling of the atomistic description to a coarse grained
or a continuum description of liquid water. The proposed computational
method is validated in the case of equilibrium and parallel ﬂow.

Introduction

Multiscale modeling is critical for computational studies of new technologies such
as those at the interface of nanotechnology and biology. Nanodevices present us
the opportunity to interact with biological systems at the molecular level for applications such as molecular drug delivery and artiﬁcial nanosyringes. These nanodevices are in turn often embedded in continuous systems (e.g. when nanoﬂuidic
channels are interfacing microﬂuidic domains) and their simulation dictates an
inherently multiscale problem.
Multiscale approaches coupling MD simulations of atomistic descriptions with
grid/particle discretizations of the continuum domain have been mainly developed for Lennard Jones ﬂuids. These approaches can be distinguished in the way
information is exchanged between the two descriptions, resulting in two broad
classes of coupling schemes: the method of direct ﬂux exchange [1,2,3,4] and the
Schwarz alternating method [5,6,7,8]. In recent years a number of eﬀorts have
addressed multiscale simulations to systems involving polyatomic, polar molecules such as water. In these simulations the handling of electrostatic and steric
eﬀects becomes critical and requires several extensions over multiscale modeling
of monatomic systems. Fabritiis et al. [4] applied the ﬂux exchange scheme to
simulate liquid water. Praprotnik et al. [9] presented multiscale simulations of
liquid water using a spatially adaptive molecular resolution procedure to change
from a coarse-grained to an all-atom representation on-the-ﬂy.
In this paper we extend the Schwarz alternating method implemented in [7,8]
to conduct multiscale simulations of liquid water. The key challenge of these

simulations is the appearance of spurious density ﬂuctuations due to the presence
of non-periodic boundary conditions in the MD domain. The present method
circumvents this diﬃculty by introducing a boundary force that is determined via
a control algorithm. We note that this approach does not involve the calculation
of the pressure tensor that is required in the ﬂux base methods. This helps reduce
the computational cost of the method, as the calculation of the pressure tensor
[5] requires a large amount of samples or the use of large cell sizes at the expense
of spatial resolution. In addition, in the case of the ﬂux-based methods a buﬀer
is necessary that should be large enough, such that the atoms and molecules
inside the bulk liquid do not interact with the rareﬁed region [8]. In the present
method the ”buﬀer” is restricted to the region where we impose the velocity
boundary condition from the continuum.

Coupling Continuum Liquids with Molecular Dynamics
of Water

The coupling of continuum and atomistic descriptions of liquid water , implies
MD simulations subject to non-periodic boundary conditions (BC). In MD simulations the position ri = (xi , yi , zi ) and velocities vi = (ui , vi , wi ) of the i−th
particle evolve according to Newton’s equation of motion:

where mi is the mass and Fi the force on particle i. The interaction potential
U (rij ) models the physics of the system. Here we consider MD simulations using
the rigid SPC/E water model et al. [10], with an O-H bond length of 1 ˚
A and
a H-O-H angle of 109.47◦ constrained using the SHAKE algorithm [11]. The
SPC/E model involves a Lennard-Jones potential between the oxygen atoms

where rc is the radius of truncation (Uαβ (rij ) = 0 for rij > rc ), and α and
β refer to the atomic species (here oxygen-oxygen: OO = 0.6501 kJ mol−1 and
σOO = 0.3166 nm). The model involves a Coulomb potential acting between all
atom pairs of diﬀerent water molecules

where 0 is the permittivity in vacuum, and qi is the partial free charge, qO =
−0.8476 and qH = 0.4238, respectively. These partial free charges describe the
ﬁxed, static dipol moment of water. [10]. In this work all interaction potentials are

236

truncated for distances beyond a cutoﬀ radius (rc ) of 1.0 nm and the equations of
motion are integrated using a Verlet algorithm with a timestep dt of 2 fs.
The elimination of periodic boundary conditions in the MD simulations results
in a non-uniform density across the domain and hinders the calculation of the
virial pressure. In order to correct the calculation of the mean virial pressure, we
impose a boundary force Fm , along with a specular wall that prevents molecules
from leaving the atomistic domain and maintains the kinetic component of the
system pressure. We detect the collision of a water molecule by checking whether
its center of mass has crossed the boundary. Molecules that hit a moving wall
during time step n are identiﬁed by computing the collision time t = (comn −
n+1/2
xw )/(uw − u
˜x
), where comn is the center of mass of the water molecule, xw
n+1/2
and uw the initial wall position and wall speed, and u
˜x
is the center of mass
velocity of the molecule after the regular leap-frog update but before a possible
reﬂection. If t is smaller than the time step dt then the molecule is crossing the
boundary and the new velocity and position of each atom are calculated as:
˜n+1/2 − 2(un+1/2
− uw )
un+1/2 = u
x

(5)

xn+1 = xn + t u˜n+1/2 + (dt − t )un+1/2

(6)

The wall force (Fm ) can be computed from the pair potential and the pair
correlation function g(r) of the working ﬂuid [7]. This technique was shown to
alleviate many of the drawbacks of existing methods but it is not suﬃcient for all
state points of dense liquids. In [8] a simple control algorithm was proposed that
can achieve the target density in the system for a wide range of temperatures.
This algorithm, originally developed for monoatomic liquids, is extended here
for the case of water. Since the kinetic energy in the system is conserved, we
enforce right virial pressure in the non-periodic system, by applying an external
boundary force to eliminate all the disturbances in the density.

Control Algorithm and Validation

We examine the validity of this method in a water system at equilibrium in the
liquid regime (T = 300 K, ρ = 997 kg m−3 ). The size of the computational domain is 3 nm × 3 nm × 3 nm and periodicity is removed in the x-direction. The
system is weakly coupled to a Berendsen thermostat [12] with a time constant of
0.1 ps. The heat bath is imposed cellwise using 6 × 1 × 1 cells and after equilibration we heat only the atoms located in the cells close to the x boundary. In order

to reduce spurious oscillations in the density we apply the control algorithm to
the mean external boundary force applied to the MD system.
The control approach is sketched in Fig. 1. Each iteration involves the following steps: we start by applying no external boundary force. Then we measure the

the liquid state. We start by applying no external force, and density oscillations

shown in Fig. 2 demonstrate that the control approach eliminates the density oscillations. Here we note that the averaged value (over 2.4 ns) of the integral of the
r
external boundary force ρn 0 c Fm (r)dr is equal to the virial pressure of liquid
water in an atomistic simulation subject to periodic boundary conditions, where
ρn is the number density of water. In [8] we showed that the value of KP determines the stablity properties and the convergence rate of the algorithm. In Fig.

amu kJ .
In this case the method has converged approximately after 900 ps. As a ﬁnal diagnostic we measure the angle φ between the normal of the wall and the dipole
moment of each water molecule. In Fig. 4 we show the probability distribution
of cos(φ) at the wall, at the cutoﬀ distance from the boundary and at the center
of the computational domain (1.5 nm from the wall). The NPBC result into a
spurious preference in the orientation of the water molecules at the wall that
vanishes as the distance from the boundary increases. The mean deviation from
the periodic reference case is 1.0◦ at a cutoﬀ distance. At the center of the
domain the distribution is uniform with no deviation from the reference case.
In addition, we examine the performance of the control algorithm in the case
of parallel ﬂow at the same liquid state. The periodicity is broken in the ﬂow

direction (x). The system is weakly coupled to a Berendsen thermostat [12] with
a time constant of 0.1 ps. The heat bath is imposed cellwise using 6 × 1 × 1 cells.
The ﬂow is imposed by adjusting the mean ﬂow velocity of the atoms [13] in the
computational cells with center points (x = 0.25) and (x = 2.75) to achieve a
mean velocity of 10 m s−1 . After equilibration we heat only the atoms located
in the boundary boxes at the inlet and the outlet. As described in [7], atoms
at the non-periodic boundary of the computational domain bounce with hard
walls, which move with the local ﬂuid velocity. At the end of each time step
these walls are reset to their initial positions to maintain a ﬁxed frame of reference. As a consequence some particles may remain outside the computational
domain and are reinserted in regions of inﬂow using the Usher algorithm [14].
This removal and insertion of particles is not symmetric and therefore we control the forces at the inlet and outlet of the computational domain separately
3

with a KP of 0.0166 nm
amu kJ . We update the control force every 60 ps. In Fig. 5
we show the external boundary force in the controlled and uncontrolled cases
and the resulting reduced density and velocity proﬁles. The perturbed density in
the uncontrolled case also leads to oscillations in the stream velocity (u) of the
molecules. The controller successfully eliminates the deviations from the target
value for both quantities at both the inlet and outlet boundaries.

Conclusions and Future Work

We have presented a control algorithm to eliminate density ﬂuctuations in the
coupling of atomistic models with continuum descriptions of liquid water. A dynamic controller, based on the errors measured in the local ﬂuid density, provides
an appropriate boundary forcing, which applies the correct virial pressure to the
system. The algorithm is validated for water at rest and it is shown to eliminate
density oscillations with amplitude of the order of 10 %. In simulations of a uniform parallel ﬂow the controller prevents the propagation of the perturbations,
removing density and velocity oscillations of 11 %.
Future work will involve the extension of the method to non-equilibrium conﬁgurations and the treatment of long range electrostatics by the reaction ﬁeld
method [15] for multiscale modeling of ionic solvents.
