Abstract. Classical formulations of data-assimilation perform poorly
when forecast locations of weather systems are displaced from their observations. They compensate position errors by adjusting amplitudes,
which can produce unacceptably “distorted” states, adversely aﬀecting
analysis, veriﬁcation and subsequent forecasts. It is non-trivial to identify
sources of position error, but correcting misplaced forecasts is essential
for operationally predicting strong, localized weather events such as tropical cyclones. In this paper, we propose a method that accounts for both
position and amplitude errors. The proposed method assimilates observations in two steps. The ﬁrst step is field alignment, where the current
model state is aligned with observations by adjusting a continuous ﬁeld
of local displacements, subject to certain constraints. The second step
is amplitude adjustment, where contemporary assimilation approaches
are used. Our method shows improvements in analyses, with sparse and
uncertain observations.

Introduction

Environmental data assimilation is the methodology for combining imperfect
model predictions with uncertain data in a way that acknowledges their respective uncertainties. Data assimilation can be used to continually correct imperfect
forecasts as well as guide a dynamic data acquisition procedure by indicating
where and when new observations will be most helpful. However, data assimilation can only work when the estimation process properly represents all sources
of error.
The diﬃculties created by improperly represented error are particularly apparent in mesoscale meteorological phenomena such as thunderstorms, squalllines, hurricanes, precipitation, and fronts. Errors in mesoscale models can arise
in many ways but they often manifest themselves as errors in the position of these
features. Such a problem can be seen in Figure 1, which shows predicted and
observed tracks for hurricane KATE. The various operational forecasts shown
of the left side of this ﬁgure all contain signiﬁcant position errors, giving trajectories that move in completely diﬀerent directions. We would like to use data

assimilation to dynamically correct inaccurate predictions such as the hurricane
KATE trajectories. But we typically don’t know where these errors arise or exactly how they aﬀect position. If we could attribute position error to a single
(or even a small number) of incorrectly speciﬁed model inputs we could adjust
these inputs using a classical parameter estimation procedure. It is, however,
more likely that the position errors we observe are the aggregate result of errors
in parameter values, initial conditions, and boundary conditions.
Since it is generally not possible to isolate the sources of position error in this
way operational forecasters resort to ad hoc position adjustment procedures.
One such procedure is commonly called bogussing [4], which removes the incorrectly positioned cyclone forecast and inserts a new “bogus” cyclone at the
correct location, estimated from satellite imagery. Bogussing seems simple but it
creates a host of problems. The bogus cyclone can introduce signiﬁcant shocks
in the dynamical system and if the original incorrectly positioned cyclone is not
properly removed the resulting “ghost” vortex can severely degrade the track
forecast.
A more sophisticated alternative to bogussing is to use data assimilation methods. Unfortunately, sequential [6], ensemble-based [5] and variational [9, 2] state
estimation methods used in data assimilation applications adjust amplitudes to
deal with position error. Adjusting amplitudes doesn’t really ﬁx position error,
and instead, can produce unacceptably distorted estimates. These can, in turn,
adversely aﬀect the quality of subsequent forecasts [8, 10].
To see why this is, consider a Bayesian formulation of the data assimilation problem [7]. The state vector Xn at a discrete time tn can be estimated
using all measurements Y0:n from an associated conditional probability density P (Xn |Y0:n ). If we suppose that the dynamics is Markov in time, that is
P (Xn |X0:n−1 ) = P (Xn |Xn−1 ) and the observation errors are uncorrelated in
n

time, and therefore P (Y0:n ) =

i=0

P (Yi ), then P (Xn |Y0:n ) can be evaluated as:

P (Xn |Y0:n ) ∝ P (Yn |Xn )P (Xn |Y0:n−1 ).

at 12Z using several operational models. The right picture shows its true path. The
errors in positions are signiﬁcant.

To simplify the ensuing discussion, we adopt a linear observation model, Yn =
HXn + η, where η is additive measurement noise and uncorrelated in space
and time, and H is a linear observation operator. Further, we drop the explicit
dependence on time by writing X = Xn and observation Y = Yn , and the
forecast X f = Xn |Y0:n−1 . Then, if the distributions in question are assumed
Gaussian, with P (X f ) ∼ N (X, B) and η ∼ N (0, R), the mean of P (Xn |Y0:n )
is equal to its mode, which is the value of X obtained from the solution: X =
X f + BH T (HBH T + R)−1 (Y − HX f ).
This equation can be interpreted deterministically, where Y and X f are ﬁxed
vectors called the observation and ﬁrst guess, and X is the estimated state. The
matrices B and R are the respective uncertainties in state and observations.
As shown, these equations are a simpliﬁed version (due to the linear observation operator) of what is commonly known as ”3DVAR” in the meteorological
community [2, 9].
It can also be interpreted probabilistically, which forms the basis for the Ensemble Kalman Filter [5]. In this case, an ensemble of estimates at time tn−1
are forecast to time tn using the model. Let us call the forecast ensemble Af =
[X1f . . . XSf ], where the columns of Af are the S replicates of the ensemble. To implement the Ensemble Kalman Filter, we will assume that observation equation
is linear (as before) with spatially and temporally uncorrelated additive noise.
We let Z represent a matrix of perturbed observations, A˜f be the deviation from
−1
(Z −
mean A¯f of Af , and write: A = Af + A˜f (H A˜f )T (H A˜f )(H A˜f )T + R
HAf ).
Both these methods perform equally poorly in the presence of position errors,
because position errors introduce bias and/or degrade the forecast amplitude
error-covariance. To see this, suppose that we have forecasts Xi , and i = 1 . . . S,
which we deem a perfect Gaussian ensemble. Without loss of generality, we will
represent this ensemble by a random variable X. We think of X as a spatially onedimensional vector quantity, also referenced by a position variable p as X(p). Let
˜X

˜ = X−X.
¯ Let us consider
EX is the expectation under the distribution of Xand X
a scalar position perturbation λ to this perfect forecast distribution, that is X(p+
λ). We now expand this via Taylor series (assuming the expansion is possible) as
X(p + λ) = X(p) + λ ∂X
∂p . The amplitude mean under the position perturbation

∂p ]. Then the covariance as a result

˜ T ]+ λ2 EX [ΔΔT ].
of the position perturbation is C = B + λEX [XΔ
If λ is assumed to be a Gaussian random variable with mean 0 and standard
deviation σλ , then we can say that the expected amplitude covariance under the
position perturbation is Eλ [C] = B + σλ2 EX [ΔΔT ]. We deﬁne Cλ = Eλ [C] and
deﬁne CΔΔ = EX [ΔΔT ] and therefore, we have Cλ = B + σλ2 CΔΔ .
This equation says that the expected amplitude-covariance as a result of random position perturbations is less certain or “inﬂated” than without. Thus it is
immaterial whether position errors show up in ensemble forecasts as a result of

model error, or they are introduced to account for model error in the forecast
uncertainty. In either case, it weakens the forecast uncertainty, causing poor estimates. Therefore, rather than try to deal with position error indirectly, only
through adjustments of amplitudes, we must also adjust positions! In particular, we can determine how the values predicted at model grid points need to
be adjusted in amplitude and moved in space in order to achieve a better ﬁt
to observations. This perspective is the key our approach. The solution is general and applies equally well to meteorological, oceanographic, and hydrological
applications.

Data Assimilation by Field Alignment

We reformulate the classical assimilation objective to allow position and amplitude adjustments. To make this framework more explicit it is useful to introduce
some notation. Let X = X(r) = {X[rT1 ] . . . X[rTm ]} be the model-state vector deﬁned over a spatially discretized computational grid Ω, and rT = {ri =
(xi , yi )T , i ∈ Ω} be the position indices. Similarly, let q be a vector of displacements. That is, qT = {q i = (Δxi , Δyi )T , i ∈ Ω}. Then the notation X(r − q)
represents displacement of X by q. The displacement ﬁeld q is real-valued, so
X(r − q) must be evaluated by interpolation if necessary.
In a probabilistic sense, we may suppose that ﬁnding (X, q) that has the
maximum a posteriori probability in the distribution P (X, q|Y ) is appropriate.
Using Bayes rule we obtain P (X, q|Y ) ∝ P (Y |X, q)P (X f |q)P (q). As before, we
assume a linear observation model with uncorrelated noise in space and time,
and Markov dynamics. If we make a Gaussian assumption of the component
densities, we can write:
P (Y |X, q) =

R−1 (Y −H X(r−q))

(1)

This equation is the data-likelihood term. It implies that the observations can
be related using a Gaussian model to the displaced state X(r- q), where X(r)
is deﬁned on the original grid, and q is a displacement ﬁeld. We use the linear
observation model here, and therefore, Y = HX(r − q) + η, η ∼ N (0, R).. We
should emphasize here that the observation vector is ﬁxed. It’s elements are
always deﬁned from the original grid.

(2)

This equation deﬁnes the amplitude prior. Given a ﬁxed displacement ﬁeld
q and a forecast X f (r) deﬁned on the original grid, it states that the forecast
distribution is assumed to be Gaussian in the position-corrected space, even if it
isn’t in the uncorrected space. Once we assume Gaussian statistics in a position
corrected space, it is immediately clear that the forecast statistics are conditioned

on the displacement ﬁeld. In particular, its second moment, the covariance B, is
dependent on q. By simple analogy, if we associate an error covariance on the
original forecast grid, this error covariance will have to be remapped when the
forecast grid is deformed. Thus, we write the forecast covariance as B(q).

This equation speciﬁes a displacement prior. This prior is constructed from an
energy function L(q) which expresses constraints on the displacement ﬁeld. The
proposed method for constructing L is drawn from the nature of the expected
displacement ﬁeld. Displacements can be represented as smooth ﬂow ﬁelds in
many ﬂuid ﬂows and often arise from systematic and large-scale1 background
flow errors, fore example see [1]. Smoothness naturally leads to a Tikhonov
type formulation [11] and, in particular, L(q) is designed as a gradient and a
divergence penalty term. These constraints, expressed in quadratic form are:
P (q) =

L(q) =

tr{[∇qj ][∇q j ]T } +

[∇ · q j ]2

(4)

In Equation 4, qj refers to the j th grid index and tr is the trace. Equation 4 is
a weak constraint, weighted by the corresponding weights w1 and w2 . Note that
the constant C can be deﬁned to make Equation 3 a proper probability density.
In particular, deﬁne Z(q) = e−L(q) and deﬁne C = Z(q)dq. This integral
q

exists and converges.
With these deﬁnitions of probabilities, we are in a position to construct an objective by evaluating the log probability. To develop a solution easily, we make use
of a statistical representation of uncertainty, using an ensemble of forecast states
(this assumption is relaxed later). So suppose that S samples X = X1 . . . XS are
to be estimated along with associated displacements Q = q1 , . . . qS , from S fore¯f =

approach is a two-step approximation. The ﬁrst-step is the the displacement or
alignment equation, written as:
∂L

Using the regularization constraints the alignment equation at a node i now
becomes:

Equation 10 is the ﬁeld alignment formulation. It introduces a forcing based
on the residual between the model- and observation-ﬁelds. The constraints on
the displacement ﬁeld allow the forcing to propagate to a consistent solution.
Equation 10 is also non-linear, and is solved iteratively, as a Poisson equation.
During each iteration qs is computed by holding the forcing term constant. The
estimate of displacement at each iteration is then used to deform a copy of the
original forecast model-ﬁeld using bi-cubic interpolation for the next iteration.
The process is repeated until a small displacement residual is obtained, the
misﬁt with observations does not improve, or an iteration limit is reached. Upon
ps ), s = 1 . . . S, from
convergence, we have an aligned forecast ensemble Xsf (ˆ
which BQˆ is computed. With these quantities, the amplitude recovery is written
as:
Xs (ˆ
ps ) = Xsf (ˆ
ps ) + BQˆ H T (HBQˆ H T + R)−1 Ys − H Xsf (ˆ
ps )
(11)
Equation 11 can be implemented using several familiar schemes. Here we outline
three:
ˆ
Ensemble Scheme: Equation 11 can be an ensemble Kalman ﬁlter, because Q
is ﬁxed. Of course, several EnKF schemes can be implemented using Equation 11.
Deterministic Ensemble Scheme: The background can be computed from
individual, aligned forecast replicates. Aligned replicates can be used to compute a statistical background error covariance. Once this is done, deterministic
assimilation proceeds from the background.

Purely Deterministic Scheme: The proposed two-step method can also be
used when a forecast ensemble is not available. Since the alignment does not depend on the background error covariance, one can align the ﬁrst-guess ﬁeld and
use the aligned ﬁrst-guess to craft a state-dependent background error covariance [3]. In essence, the same procedure that would be used with the unaligned
ﬁrst-guess can be also used with the aligned ﬁrst-guess.

erated by adding to truth a 1% (of peak amplitude) uncorrelated noise ﬁeld in
space. Only 6.8% of the state is observed (70 observations), at randomly selected
points. In particular, about 12 observations lie on signiﬁcant contour levels of
the vortex.
Figure 3a(C) depicts the contours (white) of a forecast ensemble (25 ensemble members) overlaid on truth. They completely “cover” truth, suggesting that
truth is well-captured by the ensemble members. However, all the ensemble members have position errors from truth as well as amplitude errors. Their peak amplitude can vary by as much as 10% and their position by 10 pixels. Figure 3a(D)
depicts the forecast ensemble mean, which is broader than the true vortex. Figure 3a(E) depicts the ﬁrst-guess used for a 3DVAR procedure. The background
error covariance (B) is computed from the forecast ensemble, and the observation uncertainty is constructed from a 0.01 standard deviation, iid. Figure 3a(F)
depicts the analysis produced by 3DVAR. The smearing of the vortex can be
explained by the fact that position errors produce an artiﬁcially broad (or more
uncertain) background error covariance.
Figure 3b depicts the same example using the proposed two-step approach.
Figure 3b(A) and Figure 3b(B) are identical to corresponding plots in Figure 3a.
Figure 3b(C) depicts the aligned ensemble, using the alignment formulation developed in the previous section. In particular, equation 10 is used to align each
ensemble member with a perturbed observation (of which Figure 3b(B) is one
sample). The ensemble mean after alignment is shown in Figure 3b(D). An ensemble member is is selected as the ﬁrst guess for 3DVAR, as shown in Figure 3b(E). The analysis is shown in Figure 3b(F). The reason why the two-step
approach works is because the aligned ensemble may be considered to be a far
better depiction of background uncertainty than the one containing position errors. Experiments using the EnKF to produce the analysis leaves us with the
same conclusions, as the one-dimensional examples also show. These are not
repeated here.

Conclusions

Our method is a Bayesian perspective of the assimilation problem that simultaneously considers position and amplitude errors. Our approach has several
distinct advantages: (a) It is useful for a wide range of environmental assimilation problems because a more general description of error than current methods.
(b) Our approach does not require features to be identiﬁed for correcting position errors. This is a signiﬁcant advantage because features cannot always be
clearly delineated from sparse observations and they are not explicitly deﬁned
in the Eulerian models most commonly used for environmental forecasting. (c)
our approach can be integrated easily with current operational implementations,
thereby making this eﬀort more likely to have a real impact. (d) We have examined extensions of the two-step algorithm to multivariate ﬁelds and 3D ﬁelds. In
the former case, we see that alignment does not perturb a preexisting dynamical balance. Finally, the regularization constraint in ﬁeld alignment is a weak

constraint and the weights determine how strongly the constraints inﬂuence the
ﬂow ﬁeld. The constraint in L is modeled as such because we expect the ﬂuid ﬂow
to be smooth. From a regularization point of view, there can be other choices [12]
as well.
