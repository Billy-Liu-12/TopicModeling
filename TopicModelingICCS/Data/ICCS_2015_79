Abstract
Online and offline targeting and recommendations are major topics in ecommerce. The topic is treated
as “Matrix Completion”, “Missing Values” and “Matrix Imputations” in statistics. The main goal in all
of these fields is to compute the unknown (missing) values in the data matrix. In computing or
recovering the unknown entries of the matrix, overfitting may happen which is due to the lack of
sufficient information and thus some penalization of the objective function in the form of
regularization becomes necessary. This work is based on a different view of regularization, i.e., a
localized regularization technique which leads to improvement in the estimation of the missing values.
Keywords: Feature Reduction, Singular Value Decomposition, Localized Regularization, Lower Dimensional

1 Introduction
The main task of machine learning and data mining related areas has been to seek for the patterns
and insights from any given data set and use those patterns and insights for system analysis and
predictive forecasting.
The introduction of internet has brought a new dimension on the ways businesses sell their
products and interact with their customers. Ubiquity of the web and consequently web applications are
soaring and as a result much of the commerce and customer experience are taking place on line. Many
companies offer their products exclusively or predominantly online. At the same time many present
and potential customers spend much time on line and thus businesses try to use efficient models to
interact with online users and engage them in various desired initiatives. This interaction with online
users is crucial for businesses that hope to see some desired outcome such as purchase, conversions of
any types, simple page views, spending longer time on the business pages and so on.

Computation of Recommender System using Localized Regularization

Kourosh Modarresi

Recommendation system is one of the main tools to achieve these outcomes. The basic idea of
recommender systems is to analyze what is the probability of a desires action by a specific user. Then,
by knowing this probability, one can make decision of what initiatives to be taken to maximize the
desirable outcomes of the online user’s actions. The types of initiatives could include, promotional
initiatives (sending coupons, cash, …) or communication with the customer using all available media
venues such as mail, email, online ad, etc.
The application of recommender systems has significant impact on the success and bottom lines
of many companies. As an example, more than 60% of the movies seen by Netflix customers are
selected using recommendations produced by recommender systems. [ 62]
There are many other direct or indirect metrics influenced by recommender systems. Examples of
these could include an increase of the sale of other products which were not the direct goal of the
recommendations, an increase the chance of customer coming back at the site, increase in brand
awareness and the chance of retargeting the same user at a later time.
An example of recommender system application is Netflix movie rating prediction contest. The
goal was to predict rating for unseen movies from a training set (rating was on a scale of 1 to 5) of
18,000 movies by 400,000 Netflix customers with 99% missing entries in the data matrix.
There are three approaches in the modeling and computation of recommender systems [63]
including “content based” models where the features of the items and item-item similarities are used to
find the unknown values in the data matrix. The second approach is “collaborative filtering” where the
history of user activities and the user-user similarities are the basis of the computation of the missing
entries in the matrix. The third approach is called “hybrid models” where some combinations of the
previous two approaches are used. In this work we use a specific type of collaborative filtering model
(latent factor).

2 An Overview of the Model
Since our data is of very high dimension and thus measuring distances could produce trivial
results. The data characteristics of high dimensions and high sparsity produces results indicating that
all objects of the high dimensional space are far from each other which in general is an incorrect
conclusion. To remedy these types of difficulties, in this work, we project any given data onto a lower
dimensional space where we could apply the known metrics to measure the distances among the data
points. Modern data has distinct features (sparsity, high dimension and massive size) that make
analyzing the information difficult. Having said that, though modern data has some properties that
help us to find solutions to those challenges. One significant characteristic of the modern data is the
existence of some structure in the data with the other significant property to be the “concentration of
measure” [105]. These properties of modern data suggest that though data is seemingly in a high
dimensional space, but the bulk of the information in the data is really lies in a lower dimensional
space of much smaller dimension than the original space of the data may indicate.
Another way of verifying this phenomenon is using SVD (singular value decomposition) of the
data matrix. By observing that vast majority of the singular values of the original data matrix X have
very small (close to zero) values, we can conclude that the numerical rank of matrix (k) is much
smaller than its mathematical rank. Or,
rank(X) << min(m,n)
Which means the data matrix is severely ill-conditioned or rank deficient.
In this work, a data matrix X of m by n is defined with its m rows called users (objects,
observations, customers, Items, measurements, replications Records). The data matrix n columns are

called features (variables, covariates, predictors, dimensions, attributes, factors, regressors, inputs,
fields, and so on). In fig 1, an example of data matrix (from online commercial data) describes the
conversion or purchases of different users (rows) as a function of different variables (ad campaigns or
columns) :

Figure 1. Example 1 of a commerce data including conversion of the ad campaigns for
different locations

Only a fraction of the data matrix is shown in here. The unknown entries are shown using question
mark, “?”.

3 The Recommender System model Using SVD
The following model is based on few major assumptions. The first one is that the missing data is
missing completely at random (MCAR). This means that the probability that a data point is missing
does not depend on its observed value. The second assumption is the “low rank” assumption which
implies that the information in the data is concentrated (lies) in a lower dimensional space or the rank
of the data matrix is k which is very small compared to min(m,n). This suggests that SVD (Singular
Value Decomposition) is the solution. The result is referred to as the matrix approximation lemma or
Eckart–Young–Mirsky [36].
Also, with respect to the sparseness of the data matrix, we assume that;

ܽ ൒ ‫݊ ܥ‬ଵ.ଶ ‫݊݃݋݈ ݎ‬
Where r= rank(X),
a= number of available entries in X,
for some positive numerical constant C. under these circumstances, we could accurately recover the
missing entries in the data matrix [105 ].

3.1 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
Using the singular value decomposition, every m×n matrix X can be decomposed into;

ܺ = ܷ‫ ܸܦ‬௧
Where: U, the left singular vectors, is m×n orthogonal matrix,
ܷܷ ௧ = ܷ ௧ ܷ = ‫ܫ‬
V, the right singular vectors, is n×n orthogonal matrix
ܸܸ ௧ = ܸ ௧ ܸ = ‫ܫ‬
and D = diag (݀ଵ , ݀ଶ , … , ݀௡ ) with the singular vectors;
݀ଵ ൒ ݀ଶ ൒ ‫ ڮ‬. ൒ ݀௡ ൒ 0
SVD exists for any matrix and is unique up to the signs.
To compute the unknown data entries in the data matrix x, we use an inverse version of SVD
factorization. This way, using the known ( non-missing) entries, we can find the right hand side of
the SVD decomposition, i.e., the singular vectors and singular values. Then, using the right hand
side, we can compute the missing entries. By renaming the right hand side as,
R= U and ்ܳ = D ܸ ்
And using the component of the matrices;
‫ݔ‬௜௝ = ‫ݎ‬௜ ‫ݍ כ‬௝ ்

= σ௞௣ୀଵ ‫ݎ‬௜௣ ‫ݍ כ‬௣௝

We compute the best reconstruction matrix for the matrix X;

But, we have missing entries and thus to prevent overfitting, we have to add regularization;

In this work, we apply adaptive regularization [70, 71, and 72]:

The implementation of the algorithm is based on stochastic gradient descent (SGD) where we fix all
of the ɉ’s but ɉ௜ . This way, we can optimizeɉ௜ . We repeat this iteratively till all values of ᆋ’s
converge. In the main loop, we initialize R and Q.

4 Results
The model is applied on two data sets. The first data matrix is of 75715×12 dimension containing
the conversion of different ad campaigns for a variety of regions. Fig 1 shows a sample of the data
matrix and fig.2 shows the same portion of data after the application of the model and computation of
the unknown entries. Similarly, fig. 3 and fg.4 show the data matrix in the original and also the
completed data matrix for the example 2. Example 2 is a 2722×122 matrix containing the length of

over the similar results without localized regularization.
