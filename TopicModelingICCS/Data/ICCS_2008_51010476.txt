Abstract. The paper presents hardware implementation aspects of new efficient
image compression algorithm designed for wireless capsule endoscopy with
Bayer color filter array (CFA). Since power limitation, small size conditions
and specific image data format (CFA) exclude application of traditional image
compression techniques dedicated ones are necessary. Discussed algorithm is
based on integer version of discrete cosine transform (DCT). Therefore it has
low complexity and power consumption. It is demonstrated that the performance of proposed algorithm is comparable to the performance of JPEG2000 –
very complex, sophisticated wavelet based coder. In the paper a VLSI coder
architecture is proposed and power requirements are discussed.
Keywords: Image coding, integer transformation, DCT, Bayer, JPEG2000.

1 Introduction
An endoscopic medical procedure, often accompanied by a biopsy of pathological
changes, plays a fundamental role in diagnosis of many gastrointestinal (GI) tract
diseases. Until recently it has been the most important method of investigation of
upper (gastroscopy) and lower (colonoscopy) parts of the GI tract. However,
examination with flexible endoscope is also very unpleasant experience for a patient.
Due to enormous progress in microelectronics a wireless endoscopic capsule has
been invented recently that makes possible a non-invasive evaluation of the whole GI
tract together will small intestine. First such capsule was built by Given Imaging Ltd.
[1] in the end of 20-th century. It is equipped with a CMOS sensor, lighting, data
processing module and transmission unit (Fig. 1). After swallowing by a patient, the
capsule is passing passively through the GI tract due to peristaltic intestine
movements and making photos (images) that are wirelessly transmitted to the recorder
carried by a patient. Unfortunately, this technology is not ideal yet. Due to lack of
autonomous locomotion and navigation system, detail investigation of the highvolume stomach is impossible, whereas detail investigation of large intestine is

possible only after its inflation since normally it is shrinked. Quality of the recorded
video (256×256 pixels, 8 bits per color, only 2 frames per second) is very low also.
It has been already reported in literature [2], [3] that the endoscopic capsule can
approximately reach only one megabit per second transmission bitrate due to
limitation of power consumption and severe attenuation of radio waves in a human
body. Because the CMOS sensor having VGA resolution (640×480 pixels) delivers
2.45×106 bits per image, it is obvious that without data compression transmission of
one image would last more than 2 seconds spending quite a lot of energy.
Since existing standard image compression algorithms are not appropriate for
capsule endoscopy (CE) due to their high computational complexity, simple dedicated
algorithms are under development [3], [4]. In this paper memory requirements optimization and hardware implementation aspects of a recently proposed algorithm [5], [6],
better than [3], [4], are presented. Influence of codebook reduction in entropy coder
on algorithm performance is carefully evaluated and justified. It is shown that the
performance of such a modified algorithm is comparable to the performance of
JPEG2000 – very complex wavelet based coder. It should be mentioned that problems
associated with color filter arrays (CFA) Bayer pattern are efficiently solved by our
algorithm, in contrary to the approach presented in [3]. Our method makes it also
possible to reconstruct more precisely G1 and G2 CFA image color components. In
contrary to [4] our algorithm offers higher compression range, so higher image frame
rate is possible.
In the paper a VLSI coder architecture is proposed and power requirements are
discussed.

2 New Image Coding Algorithm
Simplified block diagram of data processing in wireless endoscopy capsule is
presented in Fig. 1. The output image data from a CMOS image sensor after image
and channel coding (required for bandwidth reduction and error protection) are
transmitted by a wireless transceiver (TX) to the outside of the body where they are
received, stored and eventually decompressed for subsequent diagnosis. A control
unit in the capsule controls operation of a compression module according to
commands received from an external controller.
Proposed image coder performs sequentially four operations: color transformation,
image transformation, coefficients quantization and entropy coding.

2.1 Color and Structure Transformation
In the CE as well as in inexpensive digital cameras, color filters arrays (CFA) are
placed on monochrome CMOS image sensor to produce color images. The most
popular CFA pattern has been proposed by Bayer [7]. The Bayer CFA, shown in
Fig. 2, uses 2 x 2 repeating patterns having two green pixels, one red and one blue. It
is clear that application of the CFA results in collection of incomplete image
information (only one color component for each pixel) so color interpolation is
necessary to reconstruct the full color image from the sensor data. From image
compression point of view interpolation step introduces redundancy that is difficult to
remove. Therefore, the image compression should precede color data interpolation
step for best performance [8].
Additional redundancy reduction can be achieved by a color space transformation.
For normal RGB images this is get by the following one:

where Y is luma component while Cb and Cr denote blue and red chroma
components, respectively. However, due to CE power limits and quincunx sampling
scheme of green component in Bayer CFA, we propose application of modified RGB
to YCgCo space conversion known from Fidelity Range Extensions (FRExt) of H.264
video coding standard [9]:

where the Cg stands for green chroma and the Co stands for orange chroma.
Quincunx array (luma component) has high frequency content that makes
compression task difficult. Therefore structure conversion [8] (see Fig. 2) with
optional reversible filtering (deinterlacing) (see Fig. 3) is applied in our coder.
2.2 Image Data Transformation and Entropy Coding

Block diagram of a general transform based image coder (for only one image
component) is presented in Fig. 4. 2D image transformation is the first performed
operation. Its goal is to concentrate image energy in the possibly smallest number of
transform coefficients that are then scalar quantized and efficiently coded by entropy
encoder. As the image transformation usually discrete cosine (DCT) or wavelet
(DWT) transforms are chosen. In the proposed algorithm integer approximation of the
DCT transformation is used.

The two-dimensional (2D) DCT is a separable transformation and is usually
implemented as the 1D row-wise transformation followed by the 1D column-wise
one. In the proposed algorithm the 2D-DCT of each 4×4 non-overlapped input data
block X (separate RGB or YCgCo components) has been computed as

Y = Tf XTTf
where Tf denotes an integer approximation of the 1D-DCT matrix [10]:

and superscript T is a transposition. Since the transformation (3)(4) represents only an
approximation of the original DCT, an additional scaling operation by matrix Sf is
required in (3):

What is important, apart from good data decorrelation property, the 1D-DCT (4)
has also very efficient computational implementation presented in Fig. 5.

After the DCT transformation the coefficients of Y are scalar quantized what
results in high compression ratio and loss of information.

In the discussed algorithm the coefficients of the DCT transform are first quantized
and then entropy coded. A technique well known from the JPEG standard [11] was
applied to data blocks 4×4 instead of 8×8. Since DC coefficients of adjacent 4×4
blocks are strongly correlated they are coded differentially. The remaining AC
coefficients are entropy coded in a 2-step process. In the first step sequence of
quantized coefficients is converted into an intermediate sequence of symbols (RL, v)
where RL is the number of consecutive zero-valued AC coefficients in the sequence
preceding the nonzero AC coefficient v. If all the remaining AC coefficients in the
block are zero they are represented by symbol (0,0). In the second step variable-length
Huffman codes (VLC) are assigned to the symbols z = 16RL+|v|2 where |v|2 denotes
length of binary representation (without leading zeros) of v (if v>0) or -v (if v<0).
Value of v is encoded using variable length integer (VLI) code whose length in bits
|v|2 was already encoded using VLC. VLI of v equals to binary representation of v if
v>0 or equals to -v if v<0. Separated Huffman tables are designed for DC and AC
coefficients.
2.3 Hardware Implementation

Finally, designing future hardware implementation of the proposed image encoder has
been addressed. A developed VLSI architecture is presented in Fig. 6. As expected,
the memory is the most using resources. It is required by the 2D DCT transformation,
the color converter and the entropy encoder. Although 1D DCT over rows can be
implemented very efficiently (during pixel acquisition) the vertical one requires 4
rows to be stored in memory. Since the color converter operates on two lines, one of
them has to be acquired first and stored in memory.
In order to reduce memory required by entropy coder, Huffman codes for symbols
z ≥ 64 are not stored in a code book. Instead they are encoded as a escape sequence
follow by fixed length code. Since such symbols occur very infrequently, this
technique allows for 4 times reduction of codebook size causing only negligible
decrease in compression ratio. The proposed approach significantly reduces Huffman
code length as well as width of codebook memory word.
The estimated power budget of the design is given in Tab. 1. For VGA (640x480)
image resolution and 10 frames per second (fps) pixel clock is equal to 3 MHz. The
circuit supply current is 3 x 0.984 = 2.95 mA. We can conclude that the expected
power requirement are similar to much simple design proposed in [3], but our
algorithm offers significantly higher compression ration.

3 Results
The proposed algorithm has been implemented as a computer program and its
efficiency has been measured. Two exemplary full RGB color images, one from colonoscopy (Fig. 7) and one from gastroscopy (Fig. 8), have been used in initial experimental tests. Since the discussed algorithm operates on CFA Bayer format, the test
images have been converted into this format by low-pass filtering (with short 3-tap

where xˆn , m denotes a value of the pixel having coordinates (n, m) in reconstructed

Obtained compression ratio (CR) with corresponding PSNR for different versions
of algorithm based on DCT are presented in Fig. 9 and compared with the standard
JPEG2000 coder. The following denotations are used in them: G1-G2-B-R −
independent coding of 4 images from CFA Bayer sensor having colors G1, G2, B, R –
the simplest approach; G12-B-R − coding without color transformation (2) but with
structure transformation (Fig. 2); G12-B-R-di − coding without color transformation
(2) but with structure transformation (Fig. 2) and additional deinterlacing/filtering
(Fig. 3); Y12-U-V − coding with color transformation (2) and structure
transformation (Fig. 2); Y12-U-V-di − coding with color transformation (2), structure
transformation (Fig. 2) and additional deinterlacing /filtering (Fig. 3); Y12-U-VDCT8F − algorithm based on standard 8-point, floating-point DCT transform with
color transformation (2) and structure transformation (Fig. 2).
We can conclude from Fig. 9 that:
1) due to aliasing and high-frequency image content created by the Bayer CFA
sampling the 4×4 DCT algorithm slightly outperforms the JPEG2000 for lower
compression ratios (e.g. 15) but it is worse than the JPEG2000 for higher ratios (e.g.
30); both algorithms have been defeated by the floating point 8×8 DCT;
2) usage of color space conversion (2) is beneficial;
3) deinterlacing operation, described in Fig. 3, should be neglected since it makes the
results worse.
In order to obtain results with higher statistical significance more extensive test on
longer data set has been performed. 100 video frames have been chosen in random
manner from gastroscopy/colonoscopy recordings and coded using Huffman tables
with 64 entries (precomputed using different set of frames). From results presented in

Fig. 10, 11 we can conclude that for images with many diagnostic details the
proposed compression scheme has efficiency similar to the JPEG2000 standard. The
JPEG2000 algorithm is significantly better only for simple details-free images which
do not have big diagnostic value.

4 Conclusions
Low-complexity, low-power image compression algorithm suitable for wireless
capsule endoscopy has been proposed and tested in the paper. It makes use of integer
version of the discrete cosine transformation. Transform coefficients are encoded
using optimized, low complexity Huffman coder.
Assuming that low implementation complexity and PSNR having at least 36dB is
required, the best PSNR-CR performance has been obtained for the DCT algorithm
with the color space conversion (2) and structure conversion (presented in Fig. 2) but
without image filtering/deinterlacing (shown in Fig. 3). For it we can get compression
ratio CR = 15 for colonoscopy images and CR = 25 for gastroscopy ones.
