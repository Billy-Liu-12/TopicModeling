Abstract. We propose an algorithm to realize proportional bandwidth
allocation in DiffServ networks. According to the feedback information, ingress
routers adjust Committed Information Rates (CIRs) of different aggregates
using AIMD way to let the network reach an exactly subscribed state. Based on
CIRs, packets are marked. Simulations with ns2 show that proportional
bandwidth allocation under different network conditions can be achieved.
Keywords: DiffServ, Proportional bandwidth allocation, AIMD.

1 Introduction
To provide assured service in DiffServ [1] networks, the markers at ingress routers
(e.g. srTCM [2]) mark packets that obey the profile to high priority (e.g. IN), and
mark packets that beyond the profile to low priority (e.g. OUT). The queue
management mechanism operated at the core routers (e.g. RIO [3]) will preferentially
treat high priority packets.
Ideally, proportional bandwidth allocation should be realized between different
aggregates. Suppose a bottleneck link whose capacity is C, which is shared by N
aggregates. Let CIRi denote Committed Information Rate (CIR) of aggregate i, and Ri
denote the allocated bandwidth, where 1 <= i <= N. Then we say a network is undersubscribed when ∑iCIRi < C, over-subscribed when ∑iCIRi > C, and exactly
subscribed when ∑iCIRi = C. If Ri = CIRi * C / ∑jCIRj, we say it is proportional
bandwidth allocation. However, theoretic and simulation research in [4, 5, 6] reveal
that in DiffServ networks bandwidth are allocated unfairly between different
aggregates unless the network is exactly subscribed. Hongjun Su [7] proposed an
improved time sliding window based three color marker, but this algorithm can get
better fairness only for low to middle level of provision. The proposal in [6] needs the
modification of TCP in senders and receivers, and requires the support of ECN
mechanism. When different aggregates start at different time, it cannot work well.
Therefore, in this paper a new algorithm named Feedback Based Adaptive Marking
algorithm (FBAM) is proposed to achieve proportional bandwidth allocation between
different aggregates.

2 Feedback Based Adaptive Marking Algorithm
FBAM algorithm includes three parts:
(1) Subscription information feedback mechanism
Non-overlapped RIO [3] is wildly used in core routers. The calculation of qout includes
IN and OUT packets, while the calculation of qin only includes IN packets. Therefore,
only after all OUT packets have been dropped does IN packets begin to be dropped.
We set a variable qcong, which corresponds to an exactly subscribed state. When qin
< qcong, it means that the network is in an under-subscribed state. When qin > qcong, the
network is in an over-subscribed state. According to the mechanism of RIO, we set
qcong ≅ q inmin . Feedback module monitors the value of qin. When qin > qcong, feedback
module will send a two-value feedback information to the ingress routers. We choose
one unused bit in the packet head, and we call it subscription-bit. When a packet
arrives or leaves the DiffServ domain, edge routers set the value of the subscriptionbit to 0. When detecting qin > qcong, feedback module located in core routers will set
the value of the subscription-bit to 1.
To fully utilize the resource of the network, we use the reverse forward packets to
transfer such feedback information. For DiffServ network, the topology of core
networks usually is simple, so a static configuration can be set. In addition, most of
the traffic in the Internet is based on TCP, so in most cases, there exists reverse ACK
packets which can be used to transfer feedback information.
(2) Adjustment of CIRs at Ingress Routers
When a packet coming from core routers arrives, ingress routers will read the value of
subscription-bit in the packet head. If the value of the subscription-bit is 0, ingress
routers increase CIRs of the aggregates at an interval δ as follows:
CIRi,t = CIRi,t-1 + α * CIRi,0

(1)

Where CIRi,0 is the original CIR of aggregate flow i and CIRi,t is the CIR of aggregate
i at time t after adjustment, and α is the increment factor.
If the value of subscription-bit is 1, the ingress routers decrease CIRs as follows:
CIRi,t = (1-β ) CIRi,t-1

(2)

Where β is the decrement factor. Therefore, we can find the mechanism we
mentioned has an idea of AIMD (additive increase multiplicative decrease). The
convergence, stability, and fairness of AIMD have been analyzed in [8]. It should be
emphasized that different ingress routers implement AIMD adjustment independently
without the communication between them.
(3) Packet marking
We can use a rate meter such as TSW [2] to measure the sending rate of aggregate
flows. Let avg_ratei denotes the average rate of aggregate flow i. When avg_ratei <=
CIRi, all packets are marked as IN. When avg_ratei > CIRi, let P0 = CIRi / avg_ratei,
and P1 = 1 - P0. Packets are marked as IN with probability P0, and OUT with
probability P1. It can be inferred that such marking policy ensures that throughput of
IN packets of the aggregate flow i equals CIRi approximately.

3 Experimental Evaluations
(1) Simulation Topology and Configuration
We adopt ns2 [9] as the simulation tool. As shown in Fig.1, IE1, IE2, IE3 are ingress
edge routers, and EE1, EE2, EE3 are egress edge routers. R1 and R2 are core routers.
C1 is the bandwidth of the bottleneck link, and C2 is the bandwidth of link IE3-R1.
Every aggregate flow contains 9 TCP connections and 1 UDP connection respectively.
The rate of UDP is 0.1* CIRi,0. The edge router queues employ drop-tail policy, and
core router queues are managed by non-overlapping RIO algorithm. The parameters of

RIO are set as follows: ( q out , qout , p out ) =(20, 40, 0.1), ( q in , qin , p in ) =
(40, 80, 0.02), qcong = 42. The CIR adjustment parameters are set as follows: α =
0.002, β = 0.002, and δ =20ms. In the simulation, we use TSW [2] as rate meter. The
Win_length of TSW is set to 0.1 second.

(2) Simulation results
Our first simulations are used to valid the effect of adjustment of CIR using AIMD
way. Aggregates A1, A2, A3 are used. We set C2 =100Mbps. The simulations are
carried out in both the under-subscribed case and the over-subscribed case. Here we
only list one result in over-subscribed case. {CIRi,0} is set to (2, 5, 10) Mbps, and C1 =
10Mbps. Therefore, CIRs should be adjusted to (1.18, 2.94, 5.88) Mbps, which
corresponds to an exactly subscribed state. As shown in Fig. 2 (1), after adjustment,
CIRs of different aggregates oscillate around ideal values, so proportional bandwidth
allocation has been achieved as shown in Fig. 2 (2). In under-subscribed case, we get
the same conclusions from the simulations.
We also carry out other simulations, such as the simulation in the case of
aggregates start or close at different time and the case of aggregates have different
bottleneck link. All the simulation results show that our algorithm can work well in
different cases.

4 Conclusions and the Future Work
FBAM algorithm can detect the subscription state of the network, and send feedback
information via reverse forward packets. According to the feedback information,
ingress routers will adjust CIRs using AIMD way to reach an exactly subscripted
state. Based on the adjusted CIR, FBAM marks the packets. Simulation results show
that our algorithm can realize proportional bandwidth allocation under different
network conditions. FBAM algorithm doesn’t need communication between different
ingress routers. Feedback information doesn’t require special message packets. More
simulations are needed for the optimal choice of parameters, such as α, β.
