Abstract. In this paper, we developed an integrated multi-objective real-time
controlled scheduling methodology for Dual Resource Constrained systems.
The proposed methodology integrates simulation, neural network and fuzzy inference system approaches to obtain a schedule considering both state of the
system and objectives. By means of a case study, we have demonstrated that the
proposed methodology can be an effective tool for dynamic scheduling of DRC
systems.
Keywords: Dynamic Scheduling, Fuzzy Inference Systems, Artificial Neural
Networks, Dual Resource Constrained Manufacturing System.

1 Introduction
Scheduling decisions are increasingly seen as strategic functions for manufacturing
firms. Because of its increasing importance, many researchers have paid attention to
develop numerous scheduling approaches for machine-constrained manufacturing systems. However, until recent years, the scheduling of Dual-Resource Constrained (DRC)
manufacturing systems has not received much attention in the literature. Scheduling of
these systems is more complicated than the others. Most of the DRC offline scheduling
approaches developed in the literature use dispatching rules [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc.].
A drawback, however, of using dispatching rules is that their performances are dependent on the state of the system, but there is no rule that is the best performer for all
the possible state of the system [6]. Therefore, for flexible and dynamic scheduling
(DS) decisions, an effective tool is required to help the decision maker in selecting the
best rule for each particular state of the system. Many researchers have proposed
simulation and dispatching rule based dynamic scheduling approaches for machine
constrained manufacturing systems [7, 8, 9, etc]. Due to the time consuming nature of
simulation, some researchers have developed the artificial intelligence techniques for
effective solutions of dynamic scheduling problems [10, 11, etc.].
To the best of our knowledge, the applicability and effectiveness of the artificial neural networks (ANN) based dynamic scheduling methods have not yet been fully
explored on complex DRC manufacturing systems. In this paper, a novel real-time controlled multi-objective DRC scheduler is proposed to dynamically select dispatching
rules. The proposed methodology, tested in a hypothetical manufacturing system,
proves to be an effective method in a dynamic DRC manufacturing system.

2 The Multi-objective DRC Scheduler
The proposed scheduler (see Fig. 1) integrates several tools, namely; a simulation
model, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and a fuzzy inference system
(FIS), to dynamically select dispatching rules. A simulation experiment is conducted
to collect predefined performance measures corresponding to the current dispatching
rule set and the system states. BPNN is used to obtain the performance measures for
each shop configuration. A shop configuration considers various decision variables
such as dispatching rule sets, due date tightness, arrival rates, etc. Then the system is
real time controlled and its status is analyzed in order to detect pre-defined symptoms.
When a symptom becomes active, BPNN generates performance measures for all
possible shop configurations. In order to compare the system performance between all
shop configurations, an aggregated performance measure for each configuration is
provided using a fuzzy inference system. Finally, the best configuration is determined
and used until a new symptom becomes active.

3 An Application of DS for DRC Manufacturing System
In order to investigate the potentials and effectiveness of the proposed methodology,
the hypothetical DRC manufacturing system that consists of 24 departments is studied. There are 43 machines and 25 workers in the shop floor. Ten different parts can
be processed by several flexible routing sequences. In this study, four decision variables are considered for scheduling of the system.
• Queue disciplines: First in first out (FIFO), shortest processing time, earliest due
date, shortest remaining processing times, critical ratio, minimum slack
time, critical ratio/ shortest processing time.
• When labor assignment rules: Centralized and decentralized rules are selected to
determine when the worker should move to another station.
• Where labor assignment rules: The longest number in queue (LNQ), the longest
waiting time in the queue and the work center with job which has shortest processing time and traveling time rules are selected to schedule of the worker.
• Alternative routing selection: Smallest number in queue (SNQ), shortest processing
time at an operation, lowest average utilization first.

Four performance measures are considered to evaluate the alternative scheduling
policies: mean tardiness, number of tardy jobs, mean flow time and throughput rate.
Mean queue time, WIP, average and maximum utilization of machines and operators,
arrival rate, flow allowance factor and number of part types in the system are selected
as system state variables.
The simulation model was developed by using ARENA 3.0 simulation software.
The simulation length is determined 50000 minutes and 10 independent replications.
Then, BPNNs model for each performance measures are developed using 500 randomly generated training and testing samples. The inputs to the BPNNs are decision
rule set and current system state variables, while the output of the system is the considered performance measures. After training and testing the ANN models, FIS model
is generated by using MATLAB 7.0 fuzzy logic toolbox. The FIS system consists of
four inputs which represent the performance measures of the DRC system, one output
which is the aggregated fuzzy rating and 81 rules. The alternative which has highest
rating score is selected as new schedule.
In order to investigate the effectiveness of the approach, it is compared with fixed
scheduling approach (denoted as [1111]) in which “when rule” is centralized, “where
rule” is LNQ, part selection by machine is FIFO, machine selection by part is SNQ.
The manufacturing system is simulated for 15.000 minutes with both fixed scheduling
and the proposed dynamic scheduling approaches. During the simulation period, system state variables were changed randomly in order to ensure the dynamic nature of
the system. The fixed scheduling approach is regulated by fixed decision rules for
decision variables at the start of the simulation and this decision rule set is not
changed during the scheduling period.

Fig. 2. Performance measures at each rescheduling point

During the application of dynamic scheduling approach, eight rescheduling points
was detected. Performance measure values at each rescheduling point obtained from
the fixed and dynamic scheduling approaches are illustrated in Fig. 2. As can be seen
in figures, the proposed dynamic scheduling approach is more effective than the fixed
scheduling approach in terms of all performance measures. It can easily be realized
that when the value of a performance measure deteriorates, the proposed approach
renews the schedule so that the overall performance of the system can be improved. It

should also be noted that the performance of the proposed approach is compared with
all alternative fixed rule sets. These results also prove that the proposed approach is
superior to all fixed scheduling rules in terms of all performance measures.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we presented a new multi-objective Dual Resource Constrained scheduler for dynamic scheduling. The proposed methodology integrates three tools
namely; simulation, neural network and fuzzy inference system. In spite of the complexity of DRC manufacturing, the result of this study indicates that the proposed
methodology is an effective method to find appropriate dispatching rules.
