Abstract. We give the minisum ellipsoidal lp norm facility location
model. Our model includes both p ≥ 2 and p < 2 cases. We derive the
optimality conditions for our model and transform the optimality conditions into a system of equations. We then solve the system by perturbed
Newton’s method. Some numerical examples are presented.

Introduction

We want to locate a new facility. The objective is to minimize the weighted sum
of distances from it to some existing facilities. In addition, the new facility is
required to be within some region. The distances from the new facility to some
resources, such as transportation centers, should not exceed some upperbounds.
Because it usually takes a long time and a large amount of capital to build
a facility, after its establishment, the facility is supposed to operate for a long
period. Since traﬃc between the existing locations and the new one occurs on
a regular basis during the facility’s life circle, it is important to calculate the
location of the new facility as accurate as possible. The approximation of road
distances by weighted lp distance measure has been studied in a series of papers
([3, 4], etc.), where it is argued with empirical study that lp distances weighted
by an inﬂation factor tailored to given regions can better describe the irregularity
in the transportation networks such as hills, bends, and are therefore superior to
the weighted rectangular and Euclidean norms. Denote the lp norm (Minkowski
distance of order p, p > 1) of a d-dimensional Euclidean space Rd as
1/p

where M is a linear transformation. It is not hard to see that lpM is a norm
when M is nonsingular. Note that the lpM distance is the lp norm when M is
the identity. The Euclidean distance (2-norm distance), the Manhattan distance
(l1 norm distance), and the Chebyshev distance (l∞ norm distance) are special
cases of lpM . The lpM distance also includes the lpb norm (see, for instance [2]):

The lpM distance measure can better describe the actual transportation networks
than the weighted lp distance or the lpb distance can. In real word, the road
connecting two points is not likely a straight line, but a curve, due to existing
landmarks or geographic conditions. The curvature of the road can be better
described via the rotation of the axes of the coordinates for the facilities and a
proper choice of p. In addition, the transportation costs on diﬀerent segments
of a road may be diﬀerent due to the physical conditions and traﬃc ﬂows of
diﬀerent segments. For instance, some segments may consist of bridges or uphills.
The diﬀerence can be modeled by the scaling of the axes. The model is more
accurate with diﬀerent p’s and diﬀerent transformation matrices for diﬀerent
locations instead of one p and one M for all locations.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In §2, we give the ellipsoidal lp
norm facility location model. In §3, we derive optimality conditions for the model
and reformulate them into equations. We then give our perturbed Newton’s
method for the equations. In §4, we present some numerical examples.

The Mathematical Model

Let vectors f1 , . . . , fn represent the n existing facilities, or demand points. Let
vectors fj (j = n + 1, . . . n + s) represent the resources. It is possible that some
resources fj (n < j ≤ n + s) are just some existing facilities fi (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Let
vector x denote the new facility to be located. Below is our model:

pi

i=1

s.t. Ax ≤ b
Mn+j (x − fn+j )

(1b)
pn+j

≤ rj

(j = 1, . . . , s) .

(1c)

In the above model, the weight wi > 0 (i = 1, . . . , n) is a combination of demands
and inﬂation factor which counts for the condition of transportation equipments,
cost of manpower, etc., for the existing facility fi . And Mi (i = 1, . . . , n + s)
are di -by-d matrices, which are not necessarily nonsingular. A is a given m-by-d
matrix. And b is a given vector of dimension m. ri are constants. The constraints
(1b) give the region in which the new facility can be located. The constraints
(1c) specify that the new facility should be within certain distances from some
resources.

Model (1) is reduced to the classic lp norm location problem if all Mi (i =
1, . . . , n + s) are the identity matrix and the constraints (1b) and (1c) are empty.

The Algorithm

In this section, we derive optimality conditions for (1) and reformulate them into
a system of equations. Then we present our global algorithm for the equations.
We ﬁrst show that (1) is a convex program in order to give necessary and
suﬃcient conditions for optimality.
For any 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1, and x1 , x2 ∈ Rd , by Minkowski’s inequality, we have
n

Therefore, the objective function (1a) is convex in x.
For i = 1, . . . , n + s, deﬁne qi as the scalar satisfying q1i + p1i = 1.
Next, we consider the Lagrangian dual to (1).
We use zil to denote the lth element of the vector zi , and Mil to denote the
lth row of the matrix Mi .
By H¨older’s inequality, when Mi (x − fi ) = 0,
wi Mi (x − fi )

pi

The dual of the linearly constrained lp norm facility location problem has
been studied in [5]; however, our model includes the resource constraints (1c).

Assume there is a strict interior solution, i.e., ∃ x
and Mj (x − fj ) pj < rj (j = n + 1, . . . , n + s). Then there is no duality gap
between (2) and (1) (see for instance [6]), since the objective and the constraints
are convex. In the course of deriving (2), we also obtain that at an optimum,
the variables x, z, λ, η satisfy the following conditions:

Usually the new facility is not located on the existing facility or resource
sites. Therefore, we assume the linear constraints Ax ≤ b excluding fi (i =
1, . . . , n + s). Then, we can omit the variables αi (i = 1, . . . , n + s), since

However, the above system is not easy to solve, because it includes both
equalities and inequalities. Next, we use the nonlinear complementarity function
min to reformulate the complementarity conditions in order to transform the
above system into a system of equations (3), which can be solved by Newton’s
method. Note that min(a, b) = 0 is equivalent to a ≥ 0, b ≥ 0, and at least one
of a, b is 0. To avoid some nonsmooth points, we distinguish between pi ≥ 2 and
pi < 2 in our formulation. Notice that pi ≥ 2 ⇒ qi ≤ 2 and pi ≤ 2 ⇒ qi ≥ 2.

Let F represent the left-hand-side of (3). Let Ψ = F 2F . Any global optimization method that locates a global minimal solution to Ψ solves (1). We use
the gradient decent method with perturbed nonmonotone line search for almost
everywhere diﬀerentiable minimization [7] to ﬁnd a global minimum of Ψ .

ﬁgure “Example 1”. We then perturb each element of b, A, f , randomly by a
real number in (−0.5, 0.5) respectively. The starting point for each perturbed
problem is the solution to “Example 1”. The iterations are described in the
