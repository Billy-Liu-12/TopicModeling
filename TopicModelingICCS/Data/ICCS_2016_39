Abstract
Unconventional reservoirs are typically comprised of a multicontinuum stimulated formation, with
complex fracture networks that have a wide range of length scales and geometries. A timely topic in
the simulation of unconventional petroleum resources is in coupling the geomechanics of the fractured
media to multiphase fluid flow and transport.
We propose a XFEM-EDFM method which couples geomechanics with multiphase flow in
fractured tight gas reservoirs. A proppant model is developed to simulate propped hydraulic fractures.
The method is verified by analytical solutions. A simulation example with the configuration of two
multiple-fractured horizontal wells is investigated. The influence of stress-dependent fracture
permeability on cumulative production is analyzed.
Keywords: Geomechanics, XFEM, EDFM, Proppant, Fractured reservoirs

1 Introduction
Production from unconventional resources such as tight- and shale-gas reservoirs involves the
coupling of a number of complex multiphase flow and geomechanical phenomena. Empirical
observations from field practice suggest that geomechanical effects may play a first-order role in
production from unconventional reservoirs. It is frequently observed that the production rate in tight
gas reservoirs declines rapidly in a manner that is believed to be closely related to the evolution of
fracture aperture and permeability with time (Huang and Ghassemi, 2012). Proppant embedment and
pore-pressure-structure interactions can have a significant impact, particularly within the interplay
between offset wells. Numerical simulation of the coupled process in such formations can lead to an
improved understanding of this interplay.
In flow simulation, fractures are represented using either continuum-type models, discrete fracture
representations, or a combination of both. Continuum-type models assume a regular underlying
fracture network that is not represented explicitly. Instead, the presence of the subscale fracture-matrix

network is incorporated through a homogenization process to generate a multicontinuum model.
Because continuum-type models do not introduce any discontinuity in the domain, they may be
applicable for problems with highly connected and regular underlying fracture networks. Discrete
representation methods employ an explicit discrete representation of fracture planes and surfaces. A
common type of discrete fracture representation includes the application of unstructured discrete
fracture models (UDFM) where a single mesh is applied. The mesh volumes represent the matrix,
whereas the discrete fracture segments/elements are represented using edges/faces. Another discrete
fracture representation uses separate discrete meshes for the domain and the fractures, and the two
meshes are then joined by embedding the fracture mesh into the domain mesh. In such embedded
discrete fracture models (EDFM) the mesh generation is simple and allows the use of a Cartesian
mesh for the domain if desirable. Discrete fracture methods are particularly applicable to capture
fracture networks with irregular geometries.
Akin to flow simulation, fractures can be represented in the computational geomechanical model
using discrete and/or continuum approaches. For example, Kim (2012) extended the dual porosity
continuum model to multiple interacting continua (MINC) and applied it to a geomechanics model.
While continuum methods avoid the challenges associated with introducing discontinuities in the
continuum, the properties of the homogenized continuum need to be determined, and fracture
information such as orientation and length is not captured. Discrete fracture representations in
geomechanics include the approaches of Levonyan (2011) and Garipov et al. (2014) in which
duplicate nodes that are aligned with fractures are introduced into an unstructured grid in order to
overcome the presence of explicit discontinuities in the domain. Embedded discrete methods include
the extended finite element method (XFEM) in which the partition of unity idea is employed and the
elements are enriched.
While unstructured discrete fracture methods combined with local mesh adaptation are accurate
alternatives for flow simulation, it is challenging to achieve the same level of accuracy in the
geomechanics. A fully coupled geomechanics and multiphase fluid flow model is developed in order
to accurately simulate the fields of stress and fluid flow in fractured tight gas reservoirs. An EDFM is
used to describe the fluid flow interaction between the porous matrix and fractures, while XFEM is
used to address the discontinuous displacement field within elements which intersect fractures. The
proposed coupled EDFM-XFEM method incorporates the effect of each fracture explicitly without
requiring the simulation mesh to conform to the fracture geometry. Thus the challenges of high
computational cost and the requirement for complex meshing techniques associated with unstructured
discrete fracture model are overcome. A proppant model is also introduced to account for a variable
concentration field of proppant material in the fractures. The coupled system of nonlinear equations,
boundary conditions, and associated constitutive relations is solved by using a Newton-like method for
the fully-implicit time-steps.
The developed numerical model is validated using simple cases for which analytical solutions are
available. Results for more complex configurations with multiple-fractured horizontal-wells in tight
gas reservoir are also presented. The effect of the stress-dependent permeability of hydraulic fractures
on gas production is analyzed.

2 Mathematical description

porous media. In poromechanics equations, the sign convention is adopted positive for tension and
negative for compression.

2.3 Proppant Model
In hydraulic fractures, proppants resist the closure of fractures and play an important role in
production. Now, we propose a proppant model for hydraulic fractures. We assume that there is no
conductivity loss of each fracture segment filled with proppant and proppant obeys linear elastic
behaviors. And proppant transport is not considered, in other words, proppant is evenly distributed in
fractures at the start of simulation. The proppant’s pressure ‫݌‬௣ is exerted on the each fracture segment
face.

(a) Initial
(b) Deformed

When fracture aperture decreases, deformed proppants will exert pressure on the inner fracture
faces and resist closure. According to the Hooke’s Law, the pressure ‫݌‬௣ caused by proppant will be

Geomechanics Effects on Porosity and Permeability
Multiphase flow and geomechanics equations are coupled through porosity and permeability in our
formulation. It is worth well to emphasize the fact that fracture porosity can also be a function of stress
and pressure as well. However, we assume that fracture porosity is constant for the numerical
experiments carried out in this work. Compared to high fracture permeability, the influence of
changing in matrix permeability could be neglected. Therefore, matrix permeability is assumed
constant here.
Matrix porosity, strain, and fluid pressure relationship is as the following (Gai et al., 2003):

Where ߶ ଴ is the initial porosity, ‫ିܯ‬ଵ is the Biot’s poroelastic parameter.

3 Discretization
In this study, we use a mixed-space discretization. Finite volume method for fluid flow in space
discretization, typically used in reservoir simulation, where pressure are located at the cell center. On
the other hand, XFEM uses the nodal-based discretization, where the displacement vector is located at
vertices. The equations are fully coupled, fully implicit. The simulator is solved by Newton’s method.
For more details regarding the discretization of EDFM model, readers could refer to the work of Jiang
and Younis (2015).

3.1 Weak form
The weak form of the equilibrium equation (neglecting body force) is given by (Chen, 2013;
Khoei, 2014 and Mohammadi, 2008) and we extend it and include proppant models.

4.1 Mandel’s Problem
Abousleiman et al. (1996) presented the canonical example of nonmonotonic behavior in pore
pressure following undrained loading. An infinitely long, rectangular plate is sandwiched between two
rigid, impermeable plates. A compressive force ‫ ܨ‬is applied at time zero and then held constant. ‫ ܨ‬is
force per unit length in ‫ ݖ‬direction. Because of the symmetric of the domain, only one quarter of the
plate is analyzed. Table. 1 gives the dimension of the specimen and its material properties used in this
simulation. Fig. 3 shows the pressure distribution along the  axis with time. The pressure in the plate
interior first builds up at early time before the entire domain starts to deplete. The numerical solution
gives results in agreement with the analytical solution.

We compare our numerical results of crack opening displacement (mesh ͶͲ ൈ ͺͲ) with the analytical
one and it shows a remarkable agreement with the exact solution.
Stress intensity factor is an important parameter for linear elastic fracture mechanics and for
௄
assessment of performance of X-FEM. The normalized stress intensity factor is defined as തതത
‫ܭ‬ூ ൌ ಺ .
ఙξగ௔
The analytical solution for തതത
‫ܭ‬ூ equals ͳ in this case (Huang et al., 2003). We do the J-Integral near the
crack tip and calculate the numerical result തതത
‫ܭ‬ூ which reaches excellent accuracy.

5 Application
We introduce a 2D production problem in a tight gas reservoir. The reservoir scale is ʹͲͲ ൈ
ʹͲͲ. There are ͳͳͲ ൈ ͳͳͲ grid blocks. Two horizontal wells are set parallel in the domain. We
assume four hydraulic fractures cross on each horizontal well.
For flow, The initial reservoir pressure ‫݌‬୧ ൌ ʹͲ and water saturation ܵ௪ ൌ ͲǤͶ. The initial
porosity and permeability for fractures are ߶௙଴ ൌ ͲǤͻ, and ݇௙଴ ൌ ͳͲିଵଶ ଶ , whereas the initial porosity

଴
and permeability for rock matrix are ߶௠
ൌ ͲǤͳ, and ݇௠
ൌ ͳͲିଵ଼ ଶ . Two horizontal wells keep the
constant BHP ‫݌‬୆ୌ୔ ൌ ͷ. No flow boundary is applied.
For mechanics, Young’s Modulus for rock grains is ‫ ܧ‬ൌ ͷ
, drained Poisson’s ratio is ߥ ൌ ͲǤʹ.
And Young’s Modulus for proppant is ‫ܧ‬௣ ൌ ͷͲ . The rock is compressed at plane strain
condition. The Biot’s coefficient ߙ is ͲǤͺ. There is no displacement on the left and bottom boundary
of the reservoir. At right and top boundary, 60MP and 30MP compressive forces are applied
respectively.

The pressure profiles are shown in Fig. 6. Because of low permeability in matrix, pressure wave
spreads slowly so that after 1000 day production, it does not touch the reservoir boundary and the flow
region is still in the transient flow. Fracture segment is the one segment of hydraulic fractures that cuts
a grid block. In Fig. 7, it shows aperture of fracture A is decreased after 1000 days. Fracture pore
pressure could play a role in supporting the fracture face. Matrix pore pressure could also resist
deformation of the matrix. Therefore, Declining of the fracture pressure and matrix pore pressure
collaboratively causes further decrease in fracture aperture. From Fig. 8 and Fig. 9, we compare the
case with and without geomechanics effect. In the case without geomechanics effect, matrix volume
strain is null and fracture aperture is fixed. At the early time, case without geomechanics effect has
higher production rates. However, at the late time, production rates for two scenarios become almost
the same. In Fig. 9, geomechanics effect leads to fewer cumulative production for two horizontal
wells.

6 Conclusion
In this work, we develop a fully coupled flow and geomechanics simulator using the combined
XFEM-EDFM approach with fully-implicit time-stepping strategy. A proppant model is proposed to
simulate real conditions of the production process. The model is verified by Mandel’s problem and the
pure fracture mechanics case.
From 2-D simulation of a hydraulically-fractured tight gas reservoir, we demonstrated that it can
yield a difference in production behavior with and without considering the geomechanics effect in the
reservoir. Moreover, a proper proppant model should be employed to accurately capture the fracture
deformation during the pressure depletion process.
