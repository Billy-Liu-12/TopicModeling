Abstract. In surface fitting problems, the selection of knots in order to get an
optimized surface for a shape design is well-known. For large data, this
problem needs to be dealt with optimization algorithms avoiding possible local
optima and at the same time getting to the desired solution in an iterative
fashion. Many computational intelligence optimization techniques like
evolutionary optimization algorithms, artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic
have already been successfully applied to the problem. This paper presents an
application of another computational intelligence technique known as
“Artificial Immune Systems (AIS)” to the surface fitting problem based on BSplines. Our method can determine appropriate number and locations of knots
automatically and simultaneously. Numerical examples are given to show the
effectiveness of our method. Additionally, a comparison between the proposed
method and genetic algorithm is presented.

1 Introduction
Since B-spline curve fitting for noisy or scattered data can be considered as a nonlinear optimization problem with high level of computational complexity [3, 4, 6],
non-deterministic optimization strategies should be employed. Here, methods taken
from computational intelligence offers promising results for the solutions of this
problem. By the computational intelligence techniques as is utilized in this paper, we
mean the strategies that are inspired from numerically based Artificial Intelligence
systems such as evolutionary algorithms and neural networks. One of the most
conspicuous and promising approaches to solve this problem is based on neural
networks. Previous studies are mostly focused on the traditional surface
approximation [1] and the first application of neural networks to this field is taken
place in [15]. Later on, the studies that include Kohonen networks [8, 9, and 12], SelfOrganized Maps [13, 14] and Functional networks [5, 7, and 10] provided extension
of studies of surface design. Evolutionary algorithms are based on natural selection
for optimization with multi-aims. Most of the evolutionary optimization techniques
such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) [3, 6, and 17], Simulated Annealing [16] and
Simulated Evolution [17, 18, and 19] are applied to this problem successfully.

This paper presents the application of one of the computational intelligence
techniques called “Artificial Immune System (AIS)” to the surface fitting problem by
using B-Splines. Individuals are formed by treating knot placement candidates as
antibody and the continuous problem is solved as a discrete problem as in [3] and [6].
By using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), affinity criterion is described and the
search is implemented from the good candidate models towards the best model in
each generation. The proposed method can describe the placement and numbers of the
knot automatically and concurrently. In this paper, the numerical examples are given
to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, a comparison between
the proposed method and the genetic algorithm is presented.

2 B-Spline Surface Approximation
Geometry fitting can be formulized as the minimization of the fitting error under
some accuracy constraints in the jargon of mathematics. A typical error scale for
parametrical surface fitting is as follows;
Q2 =

N

N

y

∑∑
x

i =1

j =1

w i , j {S (x i , y

)− F }

2

j

i, j

(1)

Surface fitting from sample points is also known as surface reconstruction. This
paper applies a local fitting and blending approach to this problem. The readers can
refer to [1] and [2] for details. A B-Spline curve, C (u), is a vector valued function
which can be expressed as:
m

C (u ) = ∑ N i ,k (u ) Pi , u ∈ [u k −1 , u m +1 ]

(2)

i =0

where Pi represents control points (vector) and Ni,k is the normal k-degree B-spline
basis functions and Ni,k can be defined as a recursive function as follows.
⎧1 if u ∈ [u i , u i +1 ),
N i ,1 (u ) = ⎨
and
⎩0 otherwise

N i , k (u ) =

u − ui
u −u
N i , k −1 (u ) + i + k
N i +1, k −1 (u )
u i + k −1 − u i
u i + k − u i +1

(3)

where ui represents knots that are shaped by a knot vector and U= {u0,u1,…,um}. Any
B-Spline surface is defined as follows:
m

n

S (u, v ) = ∑∑ N i ,k (u )* N j ,l (v )* Pi , j

(4)

i = 0 j =0

As can be seen from upper equations, B-spline surface is given as unique with the
degree, knot values and control points. Then, surface is formed by these parameters.
Input is a set of unorganized points in surface reconstruction problems so the degree
of the surface, knots and control points are all unknown. In equation (3), the knots
not only exist in the dividend but also exist in the denominator of the fractions. Thus a
spline surface given as in equation (4) is a function of nonlinear knots. Assume that

the data to be fitted are given as if they are on the mesh points of the D=[a,b]x[c,d]
rectangular field on the x-y plane. Then the expression like below can be written [3]:
Fi , j = f (xi , y j ) + ε i , j ,

(i = 1,2,", N

x

; j = 1,2,", N y ).

(5)

In this equation, f(x,y) is the function exists at the base of data, Nx and Ny
represent the number of the data points in x and y directions respectively and εi,j is a
measurement error. Equation (4) is adjusted or fitted to given data by least square
methods with equation (5). For parameterization of B-spline curve in Equation (2) and
surface in Equation (4) must be produced by preferring one of the parameterization
methods among uniform, chordal or centripetal methods. Then, the squares of
remainders or residuals are calculated by Equation (1). The lower index of the Q2
means the dimension of the data. The objective that will be minimized in B-spline
surface fitting problem is the function in Equation (1) and the variables of the object
function are B-spline coefficients and interior knots. B-spline coefficients are linear
parameters. However, interior knots are nonlinear parameters since S(u,v) function is
a nonlinear knots function. This minimization problem is known as multi-modal
optimization problem [4].

3 B-Spline Surface Approximation by Artificial Immune System
AIS were emerged as a new system that combines varieties of biological based
computational methods such as Artificial Neural Network and Artificial Life in
1990s. AIS were used in very diverse areas such as classification, learning,
optimization, robotic and computer security [11]. We need the following components
to construct the AIS: (i) The representation of system parts, (ii) A mechanism to
compute the interaction of system parts with each other and with the environment,
(iii) Adoption procedures. Different methods were employed for each of these
components in the algorithms that have been developed until now. We decided that
Clonal Selection algorithm was the best for the purpose of our study.
Distance criterion is used for determination of mutual interaction degree of
Antigen-Antibody as a scale. If antibody and antigen are represented as
Ab=<Ab1,Ab2,...,AbL> and Ag=<Ag1,Ag2,...,AgL>, respectively, Euclid distance
between Ab and Ag is calculated as follows:
D =

L

∑ ( Ab
i =1

i

− Ag

i

)2

(6)

B-spline surface fitting problem is to approximate the B-spline surface that
approximate a target surface in a certain tolerance interval. Assume that object surface
is defined as Nx x Ny grid type with ordered and dense points in 3D space and the
knots of the B-spline surface that will be fitted are nx x ny grid that is subset of Nx x Ny
grid. Degrees of curves, mx and my, will be entered from the user. Given number of
points Nx x Ny is assigned to L that is dimensions of the Antigen and Antibody. Each
bit of Antibody and Antigen is also called their molecule and is equivalent to a data
point. If the value of a molecule is 1 in this formulation then a knot is placed to a
suitable data point otherwise no knot is placed. If the given points are lied down

52

E. Ülker and V. İşler

between [a,b] and [c,d] intervals, nx x ny items of knots are defined in this interval
and called as interior knots. Initial population includes k Antibody with L numbers of
molecules. Molecules are set as 0 and 1, randomly.
For recognizing (response against Antigen) process, affinity of Antibody against
Antigen were calculated as in Equation (7) that uses the distance between AntibodyAntigen and AIC that is preferred as fitness measure in [3] and [6] references.
Affinity = 1 − (AIC Fitnessavrg )

(7)

In Equation (7), Fitnessavrg represents the arithmetical average of AIC values of all
Antibodies in the population and calculated as follow. If the AIC value of any of the
individual is greater than Fitnessavrg then Affinity is accepted as zero (Affinity=0) in
Equation (7).
K

Fitnessavrg = ∑ AICi K
i =1

(8)

Where, K is the size of the population and AICi is the fitness measure of the ith
antibody in the population. AIC is given as below.

AIC2 = N x N y log e Q2 + 2{(n x + m x )(n y + m y ) + n x + n y }

(9)

The antibody which is ideal solution and the exact complementary of the Antigen
is the one whose affinity value is nearest to 1 among the population (in fact in
memory). Euclid distance between ideal Antibody and Antigen is equal to zero. In
this case the problem becomes not surface approximation but surface interpolation.
In order to integrate clonal selection algorithm to this problem some modification
must be carried out on the original algorithm. The followings are step by step
explanation of the modifications made on the algorithm and how these modifications
applied to above mentioned algorithm.

with affinity values of clones.

4 Experimental Results
In order to evaluate the proposed AIS based Automatic Knot Placement algorithm
five bivariate test functions were used (see Table 1). These functions were constructed
to have a unit standard deviation and a non-negative range. Since the antibodies with
highest affinity values are kept in the memory in AIS architecture, the antibody of the
memory with the highest affinity for each generation was presented in the results. To
see the performance evaluation and approximation speed, genetic algorithm suggested
by Sarfaz at al. [6, 17] and proposed algorithm in this study were compared. Knot
ratio and operation of making important points immobilize at the knot chromosome
are discarded in their algorithm. The developed program has the flexibility of entering
the B-spline surface orders from the user. To test the quality of the proposed model,
Root Mean Square (RMS) error were calculated for M and N values from 5 to 10 for
400 (20x20) training data points from five surfaces defined as above. Initial
population is fed till 500 generations. Increase in the number of generation makes
increase in fitting (error decreases). The slot of the approximated curves indicates the
probability of having still approximation in next generation. Table 2 shows the
statistics of GA and AIS optimization execution. RMS errors between point clouds and
modeled surface based on the best chromosome in GA and antibodies in population of
memory in AIS were given in Table 3 for four test functions (Surface I – Surface IV).
The analyses are implemented for all surfaces in Table 1. M x N mesh is
determined as randomly for Surface II – Surface IV. At Surface II shown in Table 3,
the choices for M and N are fitting to MxN=8x8. Similarly, the choices of M and N for
Surface III and IV are fitting to MxN=9x9 and MxN=10x10, respectively.

5 Conclusion and Future Work
This paper presents an application of another computational intelligence technique
known as “Artificial Immune Systems (AIS)” to the surface fitting problem using Bsplines. In this study, original problem like in [3] and [6] was converted to a discrete
combinational optimization problem and solved as the strategy of this study. In this
paper, it has been clearly shown that proposed AIS algorithm is very useful for the
recognition of the good knot automatically. The suggested method can describe the
numbers and placements of the knots concurrently. None of the subjective parameters
such as error tolerance or a regularity (order) factor and initial places of the knots that
are chosen well are not required.
There are two basic requirements on each of B-spline surface in iterations for
guaranteeing the appropriate approximation in B-spline surface fitting. (1) Its shape
must be similar to the target or object surface; (2) its control points must be scattered
or its knot points must be determined appropriately. The technique presented in this
paper is proved to reduce the necessity of the second requirement.
In this study, Clonal Selection Algorithm of AIS is applied to the surface
reconstruction problem and various new ways of surface modeling is developed. The
big potential of this approach has been shown. For a given set of 3D data points, AIS
assists to choice the most appropriate B-spline surface degree and knot points. The
authors of this manuscript will use other AIS technique to improve the proposed
method in their future studies. The positive or negative effects of other techniques
will tried to be obtained and comparisons will be done in the future studies.
Additionally, NURBS surfaces will be used to improve the suggested algorithm. This
extension is especially important regarding to have the complex optimization of
weight of NURBS.
