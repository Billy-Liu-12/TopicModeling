membranes, to which other molecules (such as proteins or cholesterol) attach. They consist
of two leaflets of amphiphilic lipids which self-assemble due to the hydrophobic effect[1]. Such
lipids are molecules with a hydrophilic head and one or two lipophilic (and hydrophobic) tails.
When placed inside aqueous ambient they can form three main different classes of structures:
micelles, liposomes and bilayers, with the latest hiding the tails from water[2]. Since these
molecules are not chemically bound between them, not only their local (vibrational) motions
can be analyzed but also their long-range correlated motions (diffusion) can be measured and
studied with all details with computer simulations. The main function of phospholipid as
building blocks of cell membranes was already discovered in 1925[3].
In this paper we have focussed our efforts in two directions: on the one side, the study
of phospholipid membranes can help understand basic biological membrane functions and its
interaction with the environment. Among a wide variety of lipids, di-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is one of most important, being a major constituent (about 40%) of pulmonary
lungs[4]. A large number of simulations have already been performed on it, often including the
influence of cholesterol in water environments[5]. On the other side, the role of proteins and
drugs and their interactions with the membrane structure is undoubtedly a relevant field of
research. To shed light on one hot topic, we have considered the introduction of a small biological probe into the lipid bilayer structure: the aminoacid tryptophan[6] (TRP), a precursor
of the transmitters serotonin and melatonin[7]. Since the human body cannot synthesize such
aminoacid and that it is needed to prevent diseases and death, it has to be acquired from the
diet. Then, it is able to act as a building block in protein biosynthesis, while proteins are fundamentals required to sustain life. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor
for the neurotransmitter serotonin[8]. Serotonin, in turn, can be converted to melatonin (a
neurohormone), that may help humans to the regulation of biological rhythms, to induce sleep,
to work as a strong antioxidant and also contribute to the protection of the organism from
carcinogenesis and neurodegenerative disorders[9]. So, given the importance of tryptophan, we
have explored its interactions with DPPC and water in a salty solution of sodium chloride as
well as its local structure, molecular bonding and free energy profiles.

Computational details

Our system is a prototype model of an aqueous bilayer membrane composed by 204 lipids distributed in two leaflets of 102 flexible DPPC (C40 H80 N O8 P ) molecules surrounded by 4962
TIP3P[10] water (W) molecules plus 17 sodium and 17 chloride ions, corresponding to physiological concentration and one tryptophan (C11 H12 N2 O2 ) molecule. Sketches of the backbone
structure of DPPC and of tryptophan are represented in Fig.1. Tryptophan and each DPPC
molecule are described with atomic resolution (27 and 130 sites, respectively). Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed with the NAMD2 simulation package[11] at a temperature of 310.15 K and an average pressure of 1 atm. The simulation time step was set to 2
fs. The recently parameterized force field CHARMM36[12], which is able to reproduce the area
per lipid in excellent agreement with experimental data, has been used. All molecular bonds
have been left non rigid, allowing fluctuations of bond distances and angles. Van der Waals interactions were cut off at 12 Å with a smooth switching function starting at 10 Å. Long ranged
electrostatic forces were computed with the help of the particle mesh Ewald method[13], with
a grid space of about 1 Å. Electrostatic interactions were updated every time step and periodic
boundary conditions were applied in all three dimensions. After equilibration (for about 10
ns), two 25 ns production runs were generated, with a simulation box of size: 74.4Å× 74.4Å×

70.1Å . The temperature was controlled by a Langevin thermostat[14] with a damping coefficient of 1 ps−1 , whereas the pressure was controlled by a Nosé-Hoover Langevin barostat[15]
with a damping time of 50 fs. Finally, in order to eliminate any artificial drift of the centerof-mass of the system in the simulations, the coordinates of lipid atoms were corrected for the
motion of the center-of-mass of the monolayer they belong[16]. In a previous simulation where
di-myristoil-phosphatidyl-choline (DMPC) lipid was modeled[17], a wide variety of properties
of the simple lipid bilayer were satisfactorily reproduced (surface area per lipid, lateral pressure
profile, order parameter of the lipid tails, etc.), so that we have not included these verifications
here.
A general view of the system is shown in Fig.2. There, for the sake of clarity, water has
been hidden so that only tryptophan, DPPC and sodium and chloride ions have been shown.
We have chosen two significant configurations, one for TRP adsorbed to sites located at the
headgroup in DPPC (left side of Fig.2) and another one for water solvating TRP (right side of
Fig.2). We should point out that TRP tends to stay close to the headgroup regions of the lipid
chains during most time of the simulated trajectories: An estimation over the full trajectory
length indicated that around 70% of time TRP is attached to DPPC.

3.1

Results
Stability of the system

Before addressing the structural organization of the system, we checked the stability of the
simulations and represented the contribution of all kinds of energies to the total energy of the
system (Fig.3) as well as the temperature and the pressure (Fig.4), in order to ensure that our
calculations were based on fully equilibrated MD runs.
On the one hand, the two main contributions to the total energy are the kinetic and the potential terms, as usual. In a deeper level of classification, potential energy has six contributions,
namely those of: (a) molecular bonds; (b) molecular, dihedral and improper angular terms; (c)
Van der Waals and (d) electrostatic (Coulomb) terms. Among all these terms, the electrostatic
one is the largest by far, as expected. All contributions of the energy are shown in the last 10
ns of the simulation run, revealing stable profiles with fluctuations up to 3 % of the averaged
values. On the other hand, we found some fluctuations smaller than 2 % for the temperature
and of about 25 bar for the pressure. The mean pressure is zero, indicating that the bilayer is
not affected by external or internal neat forces. From experimental and theoretical works, the
expected surface tension of a lipid bilayer membrane should be zero[18, 19, 20, 21, 22] what it
is consistent with the fact that the thermodynamic pressure of our system fluctuates around
zero.
At the equilibration stage of the simulation, we placed TRP initially at the center of the
membrane. After a few nanoseconds, we observed that TRP moved quickly to the waterDPPC interface and stayed there in close contact to the lipid headgroups. The most stable
configurations of TRP at the interface and when solvated by water will be discussed below.

3.2

Structure of tryptophan around water and lipids

The local structure of the system can be analyzed by means of atomic radial distribution
functions (RDF) gAB (r). For a species B close to a tagged species A, they are given by

where nB (r) is the number of atoms of species B surrounding a given atom of species A
inside a spherical shell of width ∆r = 0.1 Å. V stands for the total volume and NB is the total
number of particles of species B. The four g(r) considered were defined for the pairs:
1. The hydrogen of tryptophan (’HT’, corresponding to the three hydrogens labeled ’H1’,
’H2’ and ’H3’, see Fig.1) versus the oxygen of a water molecule (’OW’);
2. The oxygens of tryptophan (’OT’, corresponding to the sites labeled ’O1’ and ’O2’, see
Fig.1) versus the hydrogen of a water molecule (’HW’);
3. The hydrogen of tryptophan ’HT’ versus the negatively charged oxygen of DPPC (’O− ’),
located at the lipid headgroups (label ’O2’ in Fig.1);
4. The oxygens of tryptophan ’OT’ versus the charged nitrogen of DPPC (’N+ ’), located at
the lipid’s heads (see Fig.1).
The results are shown in Fig.5. The four radial distribution functions show some fluctuations in their profiles, the statistical noise observed in the association of TRP with N+ of
DPPC being more marked than for TRP-Water and for TRP-O− of DPPC. We can observe
a first coordination shell in all cases, being the binding of TRP to water the one with the
highest peaks of the corresponding g(r)s (those depicted in the left column of Fig.5). In such
a case, a second coordination shell can be also observed. Throughout our long simulation runs
used to collect statistically meaningful properties, we observed periods of time of about 5 ns
where TRP was fully solvated by water, indicating that the hydration of TRP is one stable
state of the system, i.e. TRP can be fully hydrated for significant periods of time, essentially
through hydrogen-bonding between the hydrogens of tryptophan (labeled as ’H1’, ’H2’ and ’H3’
in Fig.1 and the water’s oxygen. If we focus on TRP-DPPC binding, we can observe that the
corresponding radial distribution functions gHT −O− (r) and gOT −N + (r) (depicted in the right
column of Fig.5) show marked first coordination shells and very smooth second shells. This
fact indicates that solvation of TRP by DPPC is carried out by a few lipid chains. From our
simulation runs we observed that the average time of TRP inside the DPPC bilayer is of the
order of 10-15 ns. The structure of water around DPPC is very similar to that of water around
DMPC as it was described in a previous work[17] (Section III).

3.3

Hydrogen bonding of tryptophan with water and lipids

We can use a geometrical definition of a hydrogen bond, in the fashion as it is usually assumed
in most computer simulations of water and associated liquids (see for instance a detailed study
in Ref.[23]). It consists in considering that a hydrogen-bond is formed between two molecules
when the next two geometrical conditions are fulfilled:
1. the distance RAH between the “acceptor” molecule ’A’ and the hydrogen “donor” atom
c
’H’ is smaller than RAH
,
2. the H-B· · · A angle ϕ is lower than ϕc . Here ’B’ is the atom to which ’H’ is chemically
bound.

Marti and Lu

In our study the threshold distances were taken from standard values in the literature. So,
c
= 3.0 Å for all types of HBs and the angular cutoff was chosen to be ϕc = 30◦ . This
RAH
geometric definition has been found to be more adequate to describe intermolecular bonding
in a wide variety of ambients, including supercritical environments, than alternative energetic
criteria.[23].
With this HB definition, we computed the average number of HBs between several bound
pairs. Our results indicate that we had (on average) a number of 3.2 water-water HBs per water
molecule; around 1.9 HB for DPPC-water; about 2 HB between TRP and DPPC and ≈ 5 HBs
for water-TRP. Furthermore, we can extract additional information from the radial distribution
functions presented in Fig.5. There we can observe a sharp maximum located around 1.85 Å
in three cases: HT-OW, OT-HW and HT-O− . Since such distance is the signature of a typical
oxygen-hydrogen HB, we can safely assume that HBs have been found between TRP and water
as well as between TRP and the oxygen labeled ’O2’ (see Fig.1). Given the simulation data
collected, we did find clear HB-signature peaks for TRP with oxygens ’O6-O8’ as well, but in
a lesser extent than for oxygen ’O2’, which is the preferred site for TRP-DPPC binding. This
would indicate that TRP is also able to stay bound to the inner part of lipid heads during
significant periods of time.

3.4

Potentials of mean force for tryptophan solvation

Once the local structure around TRP has been obtained, a common way to analyze the microscopic forces acting on it is by means of the so-called potential of mean force between species
A and B, namely P M FAB (r), that can be readily obtained from the gAB (r) given in Eq.1:
P M FAB (r) = −kB T ln gAB (r),

(2)

where kB is Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature.
The use of one-dimensional (and usually geometrical) reaction coordinates is simply an
approximation to the real ones[24], which may be in general multidimensional, presumably involving a limited number of water molecules and, eventually coordinates or distances to the
other species of the system. A method which does not assume any preconceived reaction coordinate is the so-called transition path sampling[25] a very specific computational tool requiring
a huge amount of computational time. So, since the determination of the true reaction coordinate for the adsorption of tryptophan is out of the scope of this paper, we will consider radial
distances between two species as order parameters useful to account for mean forces between
them.
The results of our calculation are displayed in Fig.6. With the same order as in Fig.5, we
show PMF for TRP-Water at the plots in left column and those for TRP-DPPC in plots at the
right column of Fig.6. A free energy barrier is seen in all cases, defined by a neat first minimum
and a second minimum less clearly defined, especially for TRP-DPPC interactions. In order to
quantify the height of all barriers, we included a numerical estimation of them in Table 1.
Here we should note that in our system kB T∼10.78 kcal/mol, so that the physical values for
the free energy barriers are of between 7.5 and 21.6 kcal/mol, i.e. the same order of magnitude of
the free energies of adsorption of metal ions in DMPC membranes[26]. From the data reported
in Table 1 we observe that the highest barrier corresponds to the pairing of TRP and water
and that the most stable (averaged) distance for water closest to tryptophan is of about 1.7-1.8
Å , i.e. of the order of the typical HB distance, as pointed out above in Section 3.3. Conversely,
the binding of TRP to DPPC happens with lower free energy barriers and at different distances
between TRP and the binding site in DPPC. These data suggest that the configurational

PMF.
cost of the association of TRP to a lipid is lower than that of the association to water, what
would explain why TRP tends to stay close to DPPC during periods of time about a factor 3
longer than the mean time remaining inside the water region of the system. To illustrate such
association, we included a typical snapshot of this pair in Fig.7. Being this a preliminary study
of TRP inside a model biomembrane, we have not computed yet the adsorption of ions to TRP
sites. This is left for further analysis.

Concluding remarks

A series of molecular dynamics simulations of a DPPC lipid bilayer membrane in aqueous ionic
solution of NaCl with an embedded single tryptophan molecule have been performed by MD
using the CHARMM36 force field. The system has been stabilized for 10 ns and another two
25 ns runs have been employed to collect statistically meaningful properties.
We have focussed our analysis on the local structure of the tryptophan, when associated to
water and to DPPC molecules. After this, the free energy of adsorption has been evaluated considering the usual one-dimensional reaction coordinates based on atomic distances for selected
sites. We chose four types of particles: (1) the hydrogens labeled ‘HT’ and the double bonded
oxygens ’OT’ of tryptophan; (2) the three water sites; (3) the charged nitrogen labeled ‘N+ ’ in
DPPC and (4) the charged oxygen labeled ‘O2’ of DPPC. Our data revealed the existence of
a strong first coordination shell and a milder second coordination shell for TRP-water structure, which translated to deep minima in the corresponding PMFs, with energy barriers for
TRP-water association of the order of 10-20 kcal/mol. Conversely, the binding of tryptophan
to DPPC involves a single coordination shell for the two sites of possible association (nitrogen
and charged oxygen of DPPC versus the two tagged sites in TRP) and energy barriers much
lower than for the former TRP-water, i.e. of the order of 7-10 kcal/mol.
Dynamics of tryptophan and lipids has not been evaluated, since it would have required
simulation runs of the order of microseconds, out of the scope of this preliminary study. However, as a first indication of the dynamical aspects of the present system, we observed that TRP
shows a clear tendency to stay close to DPPC, during periods of time about 3 times longer than
for TRP-water association. As the topic for future MD studies, we plan to include different
kinds of ionic species in the system and employ more sophisticated tools such as metadynamics
to explore with more detail the free energy landscapes of TRP (plus other neurotransmitters
such as serotonin and melatonin) in DPPC bilayer membranes, including cholesterol.
