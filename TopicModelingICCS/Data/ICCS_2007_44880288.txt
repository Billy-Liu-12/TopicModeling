Abstract. The mechanistic pathway of singlet bromocarbenes (1CHBr and
1
CBr2) insertions into the C-H bonds of methane and ethane have been analysed
at ab initio (HF and MP2) and DFT (B3LYP) level of theories using 6-31g (d,
p) basis set. The QCISD//MP2/6-31g(d, p) level predicts higher activation
barriers. NPA, Mulliken and ESP charge analyses have been carried out along
the minimal reaction path by the IRC method at B3LYP and MP2 levels for
these reactions. The occurrence of the TSs either in the electrophilic or
nucleophilic phase and net charge flow from alkane to carbene in the TS has
been identified through NBO analyses.

1 Introduction
The carbenes and halocarbenes are known as reactive intermediates with intriguing
insertion, addition, and rearrangement reactions. How structural factors (bond angle,
electron-withdrawal by induction and electron-donation by resonance) influence the
relative stabilities of these states is still under scrutiny [1]. The synthetic organic
chemistry [2], organometallic chemistry [3] and other areas, principally; the ArndtEistert chain homologation procedure, the Rimer-Tiemann reaction (formylation of
phenols), cyclopropanation of alkenes [4] and subsequent rearrangements, [5] ketene
and allene [6] preparation, synthesis of strained ring systems, ylide generation and
subsequent rearrangements, cycloaddition reactions [7] and photoaffinity labeling. [8]
are some of the vital fields of wide applications of the carbenes and halocarbenes
Among the different types of reactions of singlet carbenes, the highly characteristic
concerted insertion reactions into Y-H bonds (Y=C, Si, O etc.), involving a threecenter cyclic transition state [9] seem to be important in synthetic organic chemistry
[2]. In the halocarbenes, the halogens would interact with the carbenic carbon through
the oppositely operating electronic [mesomeric (+M) - π donor and inductive (-I) - σ
acceptor] effects. Based on this, the electrophilicity of carbenes has been reported to

decrease with increased bromination resulting in a substantially high activation barrier
[10]. Interestingly both the electrophilicity and nucleophilicity nature of carbenes
have been encountered in the insertion reactions [11]. Hence the focal theme of this
investigation is the characterization of these two features in terms of the quantum of
charge transfer among the reactants during the course of the reaction and to determine
the energetics, reaction enthalpies and activation barriers for the singlet
bromocarbenes insertion reactions into C-H bonds of methane and ethane. If we
monitor the total charge on the carbene moiety as the reaction progresses (by
following, the Intrinsic Reaction Coordinate -IRC [12]) we should be able to detect a
“turning point”, signifying the end of the first electrophilic phase and the onset of the
second nucleophilic phase. In order to properly confirm the two-phase mechanism, we
carry out the charge versus reaction path probe for the insertion reactions into C-H
bonds of said alkanes. In this study we investigate the reactions CBrX + HY with
X = H, Br and Y = CH3, C2H5. The rapidity of carbene reactions has challenged
experimental techniques and hence this theoretical ab initio quantum mechanical
investigations.

2 Computational Details
Geometries of the reactants, the transition states and the products have been optimized
first at HF/6-31g (d, p) level using Gaussian03W suite of program [13]. The resultant
HF geometries obtained were then optimized at MP2 and B3LYP [14-18] levels. The
standard 6-31g (d, p) [19, 20] basis set has been adopted in all the calculations for
better treatment of 1, 2-hydrogen shift during the insertion process. Further single
point energy calculations have been done at the QCISD level on the MP2 optimized
geometries of the species on the lowest energy reaction pathway.[21] All the
stationary points found, except those obtained at the QCISD level, were characterized
as either minima or transition states (TSs) by computing the vibrational harmonic
frequencies – TSs have a Hessian index of one while minima have zero hessian index.
All TSs were further characterized by animating the imaginary frequency in
MOLDEN [22] and by checking with intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) analyses.
The calculated vibrational frequencies have been used to compute the thermodynamic
parameters like enthalpies of the reaction. The intrinsic reaction coordinate analyses
have been done for the transition structures obtained at the MP2 level [23]. The
Mulliken [24], NPA [25] and charges derived by fitting the electrostatic potential [26]
methods have been followed for the atomic charges computations, along the reaction
path.

3 Results and Discussion
The C-H bonds of methane and ethane undergo insertion reactions with 1CHBr/1CBr2
forming mono/dibromoalkanes. Reactants first form a pre-reactive complex. The
complex proceeds to form a concerted transition state that then develops into a

product. The energy profile diagram for the insertion reactions of 1CHBr and 1CBr2
into methane is shown in Fig. 1, in which the energies of complex, transition state and
the product are shown with reference to the reactants.

3.1 Singlet Bromocarbenes Insertion into Methane and Ethane
The B3LYP, MP2 and QCISD results alone have been taken for discussions in this
investigation since HF overestimates the transition states [27, 28]. The B3LYP/6-31g
(d, p) activation energies for the insertions of 1CHBr and 1CBr2 into C-H of methane

Ab Initio and DFT Investigations of the Mechanistic Pathway

291

are 4.28(TS-1) and 20.42 (TS-2) kcal/mol respectively. The MP2 value for 1CHBr
insertion is ca. 1 kcal/mol higher and that for 1CBr2 insertion is ca. 3 kcal/mol lower
than those of the corresponding B3LYP values. Replacement of hydrogen by bromine
in 1CHBr decreases its electrophilicity [29], and deactivates the electrophilic attack to
certain extent by the carbene moiety in the first phase of insertion. So the barrier
heights increase dramatically from 4.28 to 20.42 kcal/mol at B3LYP and 5.36 to
17.36 kcal/mol at MP2 calculations respectively for methane. The barriers computed
at QCISD/6-31g (d, p)//MP2/6-31g (d, p) level are 9.68 kcal/mol and 23.93 kcal/mol
for 1CHBr and 1CBr2 insertion into methane. The TSs are first order saddle points as
determined by numerical vibrational frequency.
In the case of ethane, the barrier heights for 1CHBr insertion are 1.47 and 3.27
kcal/mol respectively at B3LYP and MP2 levels (TS-3). These values have been
enhanced to 15.49 and 12.41 kcal/mol (TS-4) correspondingly for the 1CBr2 insertion.
The relevant geometrical parameters of the transition states for the 1CHBr and 1CBr2
insertions to methane and ethane have been shown in Fig. 2, Table 1 and 2. The TS
for 1CBr2 insertion into methane (TS-2) comes much later along the reaction
coordinate than that for 1CHBr insertion (TS-1) as reflected in the relative C2-H3
bond distances of 1.430 (1.345) and 1.274 (1.202) Å and the charges on H3,
0.279(0.278) and 0.255 (0.216) respectively. Similar trend has been observed for the
singlet bromocarbenes insertion into ethane.

3.2 Energetics
In general the activation barrier depends upon the polarity of the C-H bond of alkane
and the type of bromocarbene (1CHBr or 1CBr2) to be inserted. The above statement
draws support from the fact that the pair of electrons on the carbene carbon involved
in the bonding process with the C-H of alkane is more and more stabilized with the
degree of bromination. This results in the inhibition of the ease of bond formation due
to the less availability of the electron pair on the cabene carbon. The NBO [30]
analysis quantifies this aspect in terms of the energies of the electron pairs on 1CHBr
and 1CBr2 as -0.4057(-0.5595) and -0.4535 (-0.6019) au respectively according to
B3LYP (MP2) theories with 6-31g (d, p) basis set. The enthalpies of the insertion
reactions of 1CHBr and 1CBr2 into methane are -87.41(-96.40) and –68.95(-80.85)
and that for ethane are –89.31(-99.31) and –71.27(-84.86) kcal/mol at B3LYP (MP2)
levels respectively. The reaction enthalpies (Tables 1 and 2) show that the
exothermicity of the insertion reactions indicating that the transition states analyzed
resemble the reactants rather than the products [31]. The proximity of the transition
states to the reactants deviates with the degree of bromination of methylene.
Irrespective of the level of theory (B3LYP or MP2) followed, the insertions of 1CHBr
form the transition states earlier than that of 1CBr2 as revealed by exothermicity
values.
3.3 Transition State Geometries
A scrutiny of the bond breaking and bond forming steps corresponding to C2-H3 and
C6-H3 respectively during the insertion process reveals that it is a concerted reaction.
It is observed that the formation of C6-H3 bond is earlier than the C2-C6 bond in the
TS in terms of the bond distances (Tables 1 and 2). The C6-H3, C2-H3 and C2-C6
bond distances in TSs of 1CBr2 insertion reactions confirm the late transition state in
comparison to the corresponding values in the 1CHBr insertion reactions. In order to
improve the accuracy of the energetic parameters, single point computations at
QCISD level has also been adopted and values are listed in Tables 1and 2. The barrier
heights predicted at QCISD level are higher than the MP2 values both for methane
and ethane.
3.4 NBO Analyses
NBO analyses of charge distribution in the transition states give some insight into the
insertion reactivity. For all the transition states the second-order perturbative analyses
were carried out for all possible interactions between filled Lewis-type NBOs and
empty non-Lewis NBOs. These analyses show that the interaction between the σC2H3 bond of alkane and the empty pπ orbital of the carbenic carbon (σCH Æ PC ) and
the charge transfer from lone pair of electrons of the carbenic carbon to the
antibonding orbital of C2-H1(nC Æσ*CH) seems to give the strongest stabilization.
Finally we observed that there was a net charge flow from the alkane moiety to the
inserting carbene moiety. The quantum of charge transfer from alkane to carbene
supporting the donor-acceptor interaction in the transition states for all the insertion
reactions both at B3LYP and MP2 levels have been collected in Tables 1 and 2. The

Ab Initio and DFT Investigations of the Mechanistic Pathway

293

inverse relationship between the quantum of charge transfer and the activation
barriers reveals the fact that for the favorable insertion, the nucleophilicity of the
alkane should have been enhanced either sterically or electronically. This correlation
holds good for the reactions analysed in this investigation
3.5 IRC - Charge Analyses
The total charge on the carbene moiety along the IRC for the insertion reactions of
methane and ethane respectively, as calculated by Mulliken [23], NPA [24] and ESP
[25] methods using theoretical models has been shown in Fig.3. We have chosen
density functional (B3LYP) plot showing charge on the carbene moiety in addition to
the MP2 plot, which serve as our ab initio “standard”.

correspond to the transition states and the turning points respectively. Electrophilic-phase
region – right to the turning point Nucleophilic-phase region – left to the turning point.

We discuss first the insertion reactions with methane, 1CBrX (X = H, Br) + CH4.
The charge/IRC curves of these reactions are shown in Figs. 3. These two reactions
provide clear evidence for the two-phase mechanism in that there is a distinct turning
point(minimum) in all the charge/IRC curves for the two Hamiltonians (MP2 and
B3LYP) regardless of the model used to compute the atomic charges. For the 1CHBr
insertion (Fig.3 a), the charge minimum occurs after the transition state (TS), whereas
with 1CBr2 (Fig. 3b) the minimum occurs just before the TS. Thus for the 1CHBr
insertion, the TS lies within the first, i.e., electrophilic phase, whereas for 1CBr2 the
TS is reached at the starting point of the nucleophilic phase. This indicates that the TS
for insertion of 1CHBr into the C-H bond in methane occurs much earlier along the
reaction coordinate than does the TS for the corresponding 1CBr2 insertion. This
indication is fully supported both by the TS geometries - for example, the C-H bond
undergoing the insertion is much shorter in the 1CHBr (1.202Å) TS than in the TS for
1
CBr2 (1.345Å) insertion (Fig. 2) and by the heat of reaction and barrier height

294

(Tables 1 and 2), which are more negative and much smaller, respectively for 1CHBr
(-96.40; 5.36kcal/mol respectively) than for 1CBr2. (-80.85; 17.36 kcal/mol
respectively). This is in agreement with the Hammond postulate [32]. From the
viewpoint of reactivity, it may be said that the vacant p-orbital on 1CHBr is more
available than that on 1CBr2, thus facilitating the initial electrophilic phase of the
reaction. In other words, reactivity increases in the order 1CBr2 < 1CHBr. There is an
agreement in the overall shape and “depth” of the curves themselves between the
MP2 and B3LYP plots. However the turning points (minima) in the B3LYP plots are
less pronounced. The NPA and ESP curves are identical in shape at MP2 level.
In the case of ethane, 1CBrX (X = H, Br) + C2H6 the position of the turning points
and the charge/IRC curves for these insertions at MP2 level are shown in (Fig. 3).
Unlike for the 1CHBr insertion into methane, the TS-3 occurs at the turning point
(Fig. 1c), which is in neither electrophilic phase nor nucleophilic phase. But for 1CBr2
insertion into ethane at MP2 (Fig. 1d), the TS is observed at the starting point of the
nucleophilic phase conforming to the belated TS formation in comparison with the TS
for insertion of 1CHBr (Fig. 1c). In general, the nucleophilic phase dominates for
1
CBr2 insertions, whereas the electrophilic phase dominates 1CHBr insertions.

4 Summary
The singlet bromocarbenes insertions into the C-H bond of methane and ethane have
been analyzed and the influence of bromine on the transition states, energetics,
geometrical parameters etc., has been investigated both at B3LYP and MP2 levels of
theory using 6-31g (d, p) basis set. For the bromocarbenes B3LYP, MP2 and QCISD
level theories predict the activation barriers of different heights, varying both with the
extent of bromination and the type of alkane. The NBO analyses have been done with
a view to analyzing the charge transfer processes during the insertion reactions. The
charge/IRC plots provide clear evidences for the two-phase mechanism namely an
electrophilic phase and a nucleophilic phase for insertions of both 1CHBr and 1CBr2
into the C-H bond of methane and ethane respectively. B3LYP functional used in this
work, gives the same “picture” of the investigated insertion reactions as the more
traditional MP2 method for both geometries and heats of reaction.
