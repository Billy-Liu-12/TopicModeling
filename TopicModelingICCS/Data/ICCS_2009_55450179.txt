Abstract. Two-photon absorption (2PA) and subsequent processes may be localized in space with a tightly focused laser beam. This property is used in a
wide range of applications, including three dimensional data storage. We report
theoretical studies of 5 conjugated chromophores experimentally shown to have
large 2PA cross-sections. We use the Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) to describe the electronic structure. The third order coupled electronic oscillator formalism is applied to calculate frequency-dependent second
order hyperpolarizability. Alternatively, the sum over states formalism using
state-to-state transition dipoles provided by the a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff approximation is employed. It provides new venues for qualitative interpretation
and rational design of 2PA chromophores.
Keywords: conjugated chromophores, two-photon absorption, time-dependent

1 Introduction
Two-photon absorption (2PA) is an electronic excitation process involving simultaneous absorption of two photons. There are a wide range of 2PA applications, such as
three dimensional data storage, photonic devices, lithographic micro-fabrication [1],
quantum information technology [2], optical limiting, two-photon pumped lasing in
organic chromophores and quantum dots [2, 3], in-vivo bioimaging, and cell-selective
photo-dynamic therapy [3]. Most applications require chromophores with large 2PA
cross-sections to minimize laser intensity requirements and prevent overheating of targets [1]. To design more efficient 2PA chromophores, it is important to understand
their structure/activity relationships (SARs). Computer modeling of 2PA spectra facilitates understanding of these relationships and is becoming an important part rational
approach that may accelerate progress in chromophore design [4]. Accurate predictions
of 2PA spectral profiles would greatly assist in the design of more effective 2PA
chromophores while eliminating poor candidates form the synthetic pipeline. The goal

of this study is improvement in quantitative predictions of 2PA, as well as development of qualitative tools to understand the relations between the electronic structure of
the chromophores and 2PA profiles.
In the past decades several research groups had made a strong effort aimed at the
development of new compounds with large 2PA cross sections. The main guiding
principle used in those studies involved electron transfer between electron-donor (D)
and electron-acceptor (A) moieties attached symmetrically or asymmetrically to the
π-conjugated bridge. Fluorene fragment in particular was found to be a good example
of π-conjugated bridge due to highly delocalized π-system delocalized over the two
benzene rings held together at nearly coplanar orientation by methylene bridge [5].
D-π-A, D-π-D, or A-π-A molecular structures have been proposed and studied both
theoretically and experimentally. In recent studies fluorene derivatives have been extended to D-π-π-A and A-π-π-A types with the aim of increasing 2PA absorption
cross-sections [6-10]. However, the choice of functional groups and linkages the most
appropriate for developing chromophores with the largest 2PA characteristics it is still
under active investigation.
In order to accelerate the experimental efforts based on traditional trial and error
approach, a quantitative understanding of the trends in dependence of 2PA crosssection on molecular structure would be clearly beneficial. Two major approaches had
been used applied to accomplish that goal. First is based on essential state models
(three-state, four-state, etc.). Parameters of these models (such as excitation energies
and transition dipoles) are adjusted to fit experimental data. These parameters are then
correlated with details of molecular structure (π-conjugated chain lengths, donor/acceptor strengths, etc.). Another approach consists of quantitative prediction of
2PA cross-sections at chosen level of theory, followed by analysis of the physical
principles of the major contributions into this property. The levels of theory, used for
2PA predictions cover the wide range.
In recent quantum chemical calculations performed on conjugated chromophores
have shown that a substantial symmetric charge redistribution that occurs upon excitation may account for heightened sensitivity to 2PA events [6]. In their work Bredas et
al. established a good agreement between the peak values of 2PA crossections measured with femto-second pulses and those calculated with semi-empirical intermediate
neglect of differential overlap Hamiltonian with multi-reference double-configuration
interaction (INDO-MRD-CI) scheme based methods. Aside from the donor-acceptor
configuration of 2PA active chromophores, it was also established by Bredas et al. that
increasing the length and charge transfer of the molecules results in an increase in 2PA
crossections and may also result in a significant shift of 2PA to longer wavelengths [6].
Complementarily, Agren et al. theoretically studied four lowest excited states of π conjugated systems experimentally produced and characterized by Kim et al. [10] and
Ventelon et al. [9] using ab initio response theory. They showed that their theoretical
findings were consistent with the correlation between large 2PA crossections and a π
center, but that though the one photon absorption (1PA) spectra was strongly correlated
to the molecular length this was not always the case for 2PA in the visible domain [5].
At around this time it was also established by Fabian et al. that spectral absorption
features are reasonably well reproduced by the approximate semi-empirical MO-CI
methods based on the NDO (ZINDO/S), however time-dependent density functional
response theory (TD-DFT) proved to be superior over semi-empirical methods [11].

Since then Hales et al. showed that 2PA spectra for symmetric and asymmetric fluorene derivative compounds exhibit intermediate resonant enhancement of nonlinearities, with an order of magnitude enhancement for asymmetric cases, when compared to
degenerate 2PA. INDO-MRD-CI semi-empirical methods that implemented a simplified three level model were also shown to provide additional insight into the mechanisms governing 2PA events [12]. Several groups published works investigating the
structure-activity relationships (SARs) responsible for the 2PA characteristics.
The conjugated chromophores selected as the subjects of this study are presented in
Scheme 1. Theoretical models of these were derived by truncation of the aliphatic
chains and replacing them with to methyl groups in the original experimental
structures. The abbreviations of the model molecules and the systematic names of the
corresponding experimentally studied ones are: BzFBz: 2,7-Bisbenzothiazolyl-9,9didecylfluorene; BzFDp: (7-benzothiazol-2-yl-9,9-didecylfluoren-2-yl)diphenylamine;
DpFDp: 9,9-didecyl-2,7-bis(N,N-phenylamino)-fluorene; BzPFPBz: 2,7-Bis[4-(9,9didecylfluoren-2-yl)vinyl]-phenylbenzothiazole; DpPFPBz: {7-[2-(4-Benzothiazol2ylphenyl)vinyl]-9,9 didecylfluorene-2yl}diphenylamine. These compounds were
experimentally synthesized and characterized by Belfield et al. as a model compounds
for possible applications in two photon microfabrication, two photon photochemical
transformations, non-destructive 3-D multiphoton fluorescence imaging, and photodynamic therapy [7, 12, 13]. They found large (600GM) cross-sections for BzFBz while
studying the design of rigid-rod polymers while 2PA cross-sections of the polymers
were reduced by aggregation [14]. Compound BzFBz additionally exhibited a large
fluorescence quantum yield. The good chemical, thermal, and photochemical stability,
combined with desirable one- and two-photon absorption and luminescence properties,
stand out as characteristics of this chromophore as a promising material for two-photon
based technologies [15]. Compound BzFDp has been previously implemented for in
vivo 2PA biomedical imaging applications, as a fluorophore dye used for staining rat
cardiomyoblast cells (H9c2), by Belfield et al. due to its high photostability, fluorescence quantum yield, and two-photon absorption cross-section over the tunable range
of commercially available Ti:sapphire lasers [16]. Additionally, BzFDp has been
investigated as a potential 2PA free-radical photo-initiator for three-dimensionally resolved polymerization, resulting in intricate micro-fabrication and imagining [17].
In semi-empirical wave function theory studies of 2PA active organics have been
carried to a varying degree of success. The efforts put forward in these studies have
circled around INDO (intermediate neglect of differential overlap) semi-empirical
Hamiltonian models for molecular geometry optimizations and the implementation of
the INDO Hamiltonian coupled to a MRD-CI (multi-reference double configuration
interaction) formalism in the description of ground and excited states. The description
of these states were then used to calculate ground and excited state energies, dipoles
and transition dipoles [18] which in turn were implemented in the sum over states
formalism (SOS) to calculate linear or nonlinear material response.
Recently, Time Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) was successfully
used to simulate 2PA electronic spectra in large conjugated molecules [19-21]. The
coupled electronic oscillator (CEO) formalism performed well, after it was shown that
the density matrix formulation of the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equations allows
treatment of adiabatic TD-DFT on the same footing as the TDHF theory to an arbitrary
order in the external perturbation [22]. This approach was shown to achieve superior

182

S. Tafur et al.

accuracy for 2PA excitation energies, when compared to semi-empirical wave function
theory methods. The tools used for implementation of the third order CEO at TD-DFT
level are detailed below.
An alternative approach to using CEO in the framework of TD-DFT is to use state
to state transition dipole moments calculated within TD-DFT, using second and third
order response functions, and implement them in the SOS formalism [23, 24]. Difficulties that arise in the implementation of SOS are governed by the description/accuracy of the state to state transition dipole moments and excited state energies
predicted by DFT. Cronstrand et al. and Kamada et al. present the possibility of using
few states models derived from SOS to calculate the 2PA cross-section and arrive at a
mechanism for 2PA [25, 26].
Of the compounds in Table 1, BzFDp and DpFDp have been previously studied
theoretically by Hales et al. using INDO-MRD-CI with geometries optimized with an
AM1 semi-empirical Hamiltonian. All their calculations were carried out on isolated
molecules and showed a strong qualitative and quantitative agreement with experimentally generated spectra [12]. The three-level model developed in their study provided
further insight into the mechanisms governing the nonlinear activity of 2PA active chromophores in relation to the description of the molecular states. A second study carried
out by Day et al. implemented linear and quadratic response density functional theories
to calculate the photo-physical properties of D-π-A molecules including BzFDp. Their
comparison of a two-state approximation and with calculation of 2PA via the SOS
method with the inclusion of higher energy states drew a conclusion that the inclusion of
higher energy states was necessary in the description of 2PA [27, 28].
In this contribution we obtain approximate state-to-state transition dipole moments
i
μ nm
within a TD-DFT formalism by implementing the a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff
approximation (ATDA, introduced in Ref. [29]), as an approximation to second order
DFT, and employ them to identify the essential states governing the 2PA process. We
i
also validate ATDA results by using these μ nm
to evaluate the resonant 2PA crosssections with sum over state models (SOS) and compare them to CEO results as well
as experimental values.

2 Theory
Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TD-DFT) was recently combined with the
Coupled Electronic Oscillator (CEO) formalism to simulate 2PA electronic spectra in
large conjugated molecules [19, 30]. These and other 2PA predictions using TD-DFT
[31] were shown to achieve quantitative agreement with experiment and higher-level ab
initio predictions. In this contribution we also use an alternative Sum Over States (SOS)
i
approach, calculate state-to-state transition dipole moments μ nm
using the a posteriori
Tamm-Dancoff approximation and employ them to identify essential states governing
i
the 2PA process. We also validate ATDA by using these approximate μ nm
to predict
resonant 2PA cross-sections with the SOS model and compare them to CEO results as
well as experimental values.
In the 2PA-transition matrix approximation the 2PA cross-section is given by [25]:

3 Computational Details
The chromophore molecules selected for this study are presented in Scheme 1. They
were derived from experimentally studied ones by truncation of the aliphatic chains to
methyl group. All molecular structures were optimized at HF/STO-3G theory level,
which favors planar geometry of conjugated molecules and was shown [31] to give
the best agreement for the bond lengths as compared to the results of X-Ray diffraction experiments for stylbene and its three derivatives. The optimized geometries were
confirmed by the absence of imaginary frequencies in the following normal mode
calculations. The single point energy and transition dipole calculations were performed at the TD-B3LYP/MIDIx level.

Transition density matrices for the lowest 24 excited states, as well as Kohn-Sham
operators on these transition densities were printed out. Contributions of the second
and third derivatives of the exchange-correlation potentials into Kohn-Sham operators, and operators on the pair combinations of transition densities were neglected.
Commercially available computational program Gaussian98 [32] was modified as
described in previous studies [19] in order to enable this printout. The frequencydependent orientationally averaged first- and third-order polarizability tensors were
generated from the generated matrices using (1) and expressions implemented in CEO
program [33]. The habitual empirical linewidth of 0.1 eV was used for both 1PA and
2PA. To analyze the electronic structure of the excited states we used natural transition orbitals (NTO), which diagonalize the transition density matrix, and give the best
representation of the electronic excitation in single-particle terms [34]. Graphical software XCrysDen [35] was used to plot NTOs.

4 Results and Discussion
We present 2PA resonant energies and cross-sections in Table 1. For two of the
molecules, the profiles obtained with both SOS and CEO formalisms are presented in
Fig. 1, along with linear spectra, and natural transition orbitals.

The SOS and CEO results (marked by solid lines on 2PA spectra in Fig.1) are in
excellent quantitative agreement with each other, which provides a validation for the
ATDA/SOS method. Predicted 2PA profiles also agree well with experimental ones.
Experimental measurements of their spectral properties were reported in [14-16, 36].
While for most molecules agreement between resonant maxima is better than 0.1 eV,
in the case of DpPFPBz theoretical bands are red-shifted relative to experimental

ones by approximately 0.44 eV (55 nm). This can be explained by greater conformational flexibility of the longer conjugated chain, and blue shift of the absorption spectra for non-planar conformations. Overall, agreement with experiment validates the
use of TD-DFT as a part of rational design strategies directed toward new and improved two-photon absorbing materials.

5 Conclusions
We report theoretical study of five conjugated chromophores experimentally shown to
have large two photon absorption cross-sections. We use the third order response formalism within Time Dependent Density Functional Theory to calculate frequencydependent second order hyperpolarizability in both the sum over states and coupled
electronic oscillator formalisms to describe 2PA cross-sections. While CEO expressions
do not lend themselves easily to a qualitative analysis, SOS ones can be simplified to
essential state models and employed to identify 2PA resonant states and interpret the
relationships between electronic structure and 2PA profiles.
We also use Natural Transition orbitals to compare the electronic structure of the
linear and two-photon absorbing states. State to state transition dipole moments, necessary for SOS expressions are calculated with the a posteriori Tamm-Dancoff approximation and used to describe two-photon processes. Numerical values of the
cross-sections obtained in SOS and CEO were found to be in good quantitative
agreement with each other. This is the first time that TD-DFT/CEO and ATDA-DFT/
SOS methods have been compared for the calculation of 2PA spectra. Both CEO and
SOS results are in good agreement with experiment. This validates the use of
TD-DFT as a part of rational design strategies directed toward new and improved
Two-Photon absorbing materials for bioimaging and optical data storage.
