Abstract

H(2-n)X(n)A=Te (X=H, F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si and Ge; n=0-2), the novel heavy congeners of formaldehyde, have
been studied in the gas phase using MP2/def2-TVZP and BP86/def2-TVZP methods. Emphasis has been laid
on the bond strengths and the standard heats of formation ( f°) of the mentioned telluro-ketones to reveal
their thermodynamic stabilities and further assist in their isolations. The bond strengths have been evaluated in
-bond energy and the bond dissociation enthalpy, D°, using isodesmic reaction
schemes. The methodology employed has satisfactorily reproduced the bond strengths and the
f° of
formaldehyde and silanone. The findings from this work indicate that the D° of the F2A=Te (A=C, Si and Ge)
molecules are comparable to that of H2C=O and thus their respective stabilities are expected to be equivalent to
that of formaldehyde. Besides, the fluorinated telluro-ketones are predicted to possess a unique thermodynamic
stability since they have the most exothermic
f° in their respective series while the H2A=Te ketones have the
most endothermic
f°. In addition, the silanetellones are found to be thermodynamically more stable than
their corresponding telluroformaldehyde and germanetellone analogs. Since reported data for H(2-n)X(n)A=Te
(X=H, F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si and Ge; n=0-2) is non-existent in terms of the thermodynamic data, the findings
of this work should supplement the literature with reliable information.

1. Introduction
The chemistry of molecules with a double bond between carbon and heavier group 16 elements has been
studied extensively and most of their structures and properties have been systematically elucidated so far [1,2].
reactive double bond as
compared to their carbon analogs [3]. However, the recent synthesis and isolation of monomeric heavy ketones
[4-11], and their subsequent characterizations provide incentives for the existence of relatively simple yet
relatively energetic heavy ketones.
Telluroformaldehyde (H2C=Te) was first stabilized by coordination to transition-metal centers by Roper et al.
in 1983 [12,13] but the synthesis and isolation of tellurium containing heavy ketones are still elusive.
Following our interest in telluro-ketones, we reported the structures, ionization potentials, electron affinities,
singlet-triplet gaps and the Kohn-Sham HOMO-LUMO gaps of X2A=Te and XYA=Te (A=C and Si and X,
Y=H, F, Cl, Br, I and CN) molecules [14,15]. The kinetic and thermodynamic stabilities of these novel entities
have always been questioned. Hoffmann et al. [16
calculated molecules for which there is as yet no experimental evidence, are much expected and a degree of
realism in what is calculated would help allay the skepticism of experimental communities. In this light, we
studied the energetic favorability of the unimolecular isomerization and decomposition reactions of H2A=Te
and HFA=Te (A=C, Si and Ge) molecules on their singlet state potential energy surface using the second order
Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) [17]. Telluroformaldehyde, silanetellone, and germanetellone were
found to be kinetically and thermodynamically more resistant to the unimolecular reactions explored, than the
corresponding lighter chalcogen analogs. Besides, the ground state telluro-ketones were predicted to be viable
molecules, as they have no imaginary vibrational frequencies and their lowest vibrational frequency is always
>100 cm-1.
Accurate thermodynamic data of small molecules are invaluable to their progress in every aspect of chemistry
[18]. Hoffmann et al. [16] even reported that the thermodynamic stability governed by free energy changes,
bility criterion. The standard heat of formation ( f°), is one of the thermodynamic
property that modern computational chemistry can address most directly using well tested methods such as the
Gaussian-n (Gn) methods [19-23]. Following the quest for developing new approach to improve the accuracy
of the computations of thermochemical properties, Kruse et al. [24] proposed the B3LYP-gCP-D3/6-31G(d)
model of chemistry. In addition, Sousa and co-workers [25] found that the G3(MP2)//B3LYP prediction for the
heat of formation of 6,7-dihydro-4(5H)(4.19 kJ/mol) when compared with experimental data. However, these methods are not applicable for tellurium
containing molecules due to the non-availability of basis sets for Te atom. Recently, Berezovskaya et al. [26]
successfully confirmed the experimental thermodynamic data of molybdenum-tellurium oxides, theoretically,
by performing the density functional theory (DFT) with the BP86 functional and ab initio (MP2) computations
in conjunction with def2-TVZP basis sets [27,28]. Another important quantity to assess the inherent stability of
R2M=X (M=C, Si, Ge, Sn and Pb; X=O, S, Se and Te) molecules is the M=X bond dissociation energies (BDE)
[7,29]. In this context, Suzuki et al. [7

B3LYP/TZ(d,p) level with the procedure proposed by Schleyer and Kost [30]

ketones was reported to

turn indicated the high reactivity of the heavy ketones towards any kind of addition reaction [7].
In the present research, we seek to study the thermodynamic stability of H(2-n)X(n)A=Te (X=H, F, Cl and Br;
A=C, Si and Ge; n=0-2), by predicting their standard heats
f°). In addition, to gain more
confidence on the reactivity and thermodynamic stability of the mentioned novel telluro-ketones, the A=Te
bond diss
-bond energies are also predicted.
2. Computational methods
Quantum chemical computations were performed using Gaussian 09 program package [31] by means of the
resources provided by GridChem Science Gateway [32]. Formaldehyde and silanone as well as the H(2n)X(n)A=Te (X=F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si and Ge) molecules were fully optimized in the gas phase using the
second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) [33] and the DFT at the BP86 level of theory [34,35].
The def2-TVZP triple split valence basis sets [27,28] with a polarization function and small core ECP functions
for Te atom were employed for computations. Vibrational frequency analyses were performed and the
stationary points were properly checked to identify them as true minima.
The bond dissociation energy (D°) of the ketones was obtained from the difference in enthalpy at 298 K
between the H(2-n)X(n)A=E (X=F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si and Ge) molecules and those of the triplet H(2-n)X(n)A
species and the atom E formed via the dissociation represented as reaction (I):
H(2-n) X(n) A=E(g)

H(2-n) X(n) A (g) + E(g)

n=0-2

(I)

The -bond energies of the H(2-n)X(n)A=E molecules were calculated by adopting the procedure of
Schleyer and Kost [30 ] using the isodesmic reactions (II) and (III):
H(2-n) X(n) A=E(g) + H(4-n) X(n)(g) + EH2 (g)

Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) [36-38] analysis of some of the scrutinized ketones was performed using the MP2/

3. Results and discussion
This section comprises a systematic analysis and discussion of the bond strengths (in terms of E , E , and D°),
NBO results and standard heats of formation ( f°) of H(2-n)X(n)A=E (X=H, F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si and Ge;
E=O and Te; n=0-2). All these molecules were optimized as neutral ground state structures with no imaginary
vibrational frequencies.

their characterizations. Table 1 reports the predicted values of bond dissociation enthalpy, E and E in

knowledge of the energies required to break bonds and energies released upon their formation is fundamental to
understand chemical processes. The energy required for homolytic bond cleavage at 298 K corresponds to the
bond dissociation enthalpy of a molecule, D°. Interestingly, E and E bond energies estimates are also
important quantities that characterize the bond strength of heavy ketones.

Upon critical analysis of the bond energies predicted in Table 1, the following points of interests can be noted:
1) Generally, the DFT-BP86 results are in better accordance with the literature data collected.
2) A carbonThis is the energetic basis of the stability of compounds bearing the C=O moiety. The observed values of

substantial gain in energy. According to the predicted E
bond cleavage varies as A=C >
A=Ge.
The A=Te (A=C, Si and Ge) double bonds are weaker than two of the corresponding single linkages. The
relationship between the homolytic A=Te bond cleavage (y) and the E (x) depicted in Figure 2, is
described by the equation, y = 1.457x + 18.60. Thus y is approximately 1.5x and the ratio of the A=Te

5)

The MP2 computations reveal that the C=Te bond dissociation of telluroformaldehyde is about 35
kcal/mol less than that for H2C=O and the corresponding energy difference between H2Si=O and H2Si=Te
is 97.8 kcal/mol with H2Si=O being more stable. On the other hand, the D° of H2Ge=O and H2Ge=Te are
almost comparable.

6)

The E(
estimates for H(2-n)X(n)A=E (X=H, F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si and Ge; n=0-2) roughly corresponds
to the respective D° of the ketones.
In most of the cases, the predicted E , E and D° of H2A=Te (A=C, Si and Ge) molecules increase upon
substitution of the H atoms by halogens. Moreover the D° of F2A=Te (A=C, Si and Ge) are comparable to
that of H2C=O and thus their respective stabilities are also equivalent to that of formaldehyde.
2A=Te (A=C, Si and Ge) are smaller than their corresponding
lighter chalcogen analogs, the A=Te doubly bonded compounds are synthetically accessible if one can find
an appropriate synthetic methodology, since our previous work [17] predicted that the telluro-ketones are
more resistant towards unimolecular decomposition reactions, in comparison with their analogs comprising
the A=E (E=O, S and Se) moiety.

3.2 The Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) Analysis
The bond strength and the stabilities of the scrutinized telluro-ketones can be quantitatively considered and
evaluated within the framework of the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) theory [36-38], according to which the
electronic population of a molecular system should be distributed over a set of localized oneLewis-type picture of the electronic system. In this context, the delocalization effects are evidenced by small
occupancies of the set of anti-bonding orbitals, the stabilizing effect of such delocalization interactions being

811

812

quantitatively obtained as second perturbation estimates of the corresponding bonding-anti-bonding
interactions.
Tables 2 and 3 represent the selected results from the natural population analysis and the second order
perturbation stabilization theory analysis, respectively. The NBO results confirm that structure of the H2A=Te
(A=C, Si and Ge) molecules, comprise of AH ATe ATe and two lone pairs of electrons on the tellurium atom.
One of the lone pairs on tellurium, LP(1)Te, has mainly s character while the second lone pair is purely of p
character. The BD(1) A-Te (A=C, Si and Ge) from Table 2 corresponds to the A-Te bond since the occupancy
of their respective p-orbital is 99%. It is noted that in the C-Te bond of H2C=Te, the contributions of the carbon
atom to the p orbital, is only about 9% lesser than that of the tellurium atom (45.18% C and 54.82% Te) whereas
in the Si-Te and Ge-Te bonds the atoms contribution to the orbital is significantly shifted towards tellurium
(about 73% Te in both cases). Moreover the electrons for H2Si=Te and H2Ge=Te are better described as
_
_
+
+
Si _Te and Ge _Te . This is in agreement the atomic partial charges (e) which are q(C)= -0.61 and q(Te)=
+0.24 in H2C=Te while q(Si)= +0.84 and q(Te)= -0.39 in H2Si=Te and q(Ge)= +0.79 and q(Te)= -0.39 in
H2Ge=Te. Apparently, the H2C=Te is less reactive towards nucleophiles and thus more stable than the Si and
Ge containing analogs.
The A-H bonds are found to be polarized since the antibonding AH orbitals have a greater wavefunction
coefficient at the carbon as compared to the hydrogen. Therefore, the overlap with the tellurium p-electrons is
relatively effective. The relatively higher stabilization energies associated with the interactions of the AH
orbitals, indicate that the - overlap contributes to the stability of the molecule. Besides, upon studying Table
3, it is noted that the second order perturbation stabilization is dominated by the donation of electrons from the
lone pair electron of tellurium, LP(2)Te, to the antibonding A-H orbitals. Furthermore the populated, bonding
A-H and A-Te (A=Si and Ge) orbitals behave as electron donors to the antibonding A-H and A-Te orbitals as
described in Table 3. The leading donor-acceptor interactions are responsible for some stabilizing effect on the
telluro-ketones.
3.3 Heats of Formation (

f°)

Table 4 reports the standard predicted heats of formation ( f°) of H(2-n)X(n)A=E (X=H, F, Cl and Br; A=C, Si
and Ge; E=O and Te; n=0-2). Chemical equation (IV) and the MP2/def2-TVZP method have satisfactorily
f° of H2C=O, -26.05±0.42 kcal/mol [43] and of H2Si=O, -23.50 kcal/mol [44]. Thus
there is a level of confidence in the estimation of the enthalpy of formation of the telluro-ketones. Upon
analyzing the predicted heats of formation from Table 4, it can be noted that the heats of formation of the
silanetellones are more exothermic than the corresponding telluroformaldehydes and germanetellones. In
addition, the F2A=Te (A=C, Si and Ge) molecules have the most exothermic heat of formation of their
respective series while the H2
f°. This unique thermodynamic stability
of the fluorinated telluro-ketones relative to the other ketones of the group, are in perfect agreement with the
trend observed for the predicted bond dissociation enthalpies in Table 1.

4.0 Conclusions
The E , E , the bond dissociation enthalpy and the standard heat of formation of H(2-n)X(n)A=Te (X=H, F, Cl
and Br; A=C, Si and Ge) molecules are reported for the first time. Our computations furnish reliable data as
there is a good agreement between the predicted and literature data for formaldehyde and silanone. The
silanetellones are found to be thermodynamically more stable than their corresponding telluroformaldehyde and
germanetellone analogs. This conclusion is supported by the significant E , E and D° values as well as the
highly exothermic heat of formation of the silanetellones. In addition the NBO results of H2Si=Te also
predicted a distinctive stability through the leading donor-acceptor interactions as reported in Table 3. Another
remarkable observation is that the fluorinated telluro-ketones are thermodynamically more stable than the other
ketones in their respective series. We hope that the findings of this research work will be useful to
experimentalists in the quests for stable monomeric heavy ketones.
