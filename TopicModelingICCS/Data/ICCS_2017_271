computational methods exist to examine protein target and drug interactions, often with a huge tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy, with the accuracy still being very dependent on the system being
studied. This study looks at a multi-tiered approach of using a more efficient method to do an initial
virtual screen of a chemical library and a theoretically more accurate method on a top-scoring subset
from the initial screen. The test protein under investigation is lymphocyte-specific kinase LCK, an
SRC-family protein implicated as a drug target in many cancers and also known to have toxic effects
when unintentionally targeted. We have built models of several conformations, performed a first tier
of molecular docking calculations using benchmark data, and done initial development of second tier
calculations using molecular mechanics energies combined with generalized Born and surface area
continuum solvation (MM/GBSA). This significant research will help alleviate the current economic
burden of developing new pharmaceuticals by innovatively utilizing massive computational power
and address important public health concerns by providing safer and more affordable drugs.
SRC-family proteins consist of conserved SRC homology (SH) domains starting from the Cterminus, SH1 (kinase, catalytic domain), SH2 (phosphotyrosine recognition region), SH3 (prolinemotif recognition region), followed by a unique domain. Crystal structures of the LCK SH1, SH2,
SH3, and combined SH2 and SH3 domains exist but not of all three complexed together. Several
studies have evaluated the use of homology modeling and molecular docking for kinase drug design
(Rockey & Elcock, 2006; Tuccinardi, Botta, Giordano, & Martinelli, 2010). To our knowledge, no in
depth computational modelling efforts have been done to generate three-dimensional structures of
LCK conformations (active and inactive) including all three SH domains, all of which have been
targeted in drug discovery (Lee et al., 2010; Scapin, 2002; Zellefrow et al., 2006). In this study we
build models of LCK, test them for usefulness in docking studies using a benchmark set of active and
decoy compounds, and set-up an automated workflow to increase accuracy of docking calculations
using MM/GBSA (Graves et al., 2008; Greenidge, Kramer, Mozziconacci, & Wolf, 2012; Rastelli,
Degliesposti, Del Rio, & Sgobba, 2009; Zhang, Wong, & Lightstone, 2014). The plan is to use a
multi-tiered approach of calculations allowing to screen massively large chemical libraries. The first
step will be virtual screening with the very efficient but not as accurate molecular docking. Top
scoring hits from this step will be used in an MM/GBSA screening. Here we report some initial
findings using MM/GBSA as a second tier screening.

Figure 1: Graphical depiction of entire workflow

2 Methods
Multiple homology models are built to represent the active state, the inactive state, and the DFGout inactive state. Molecular dynamics is performed on each model and snapshots are selected from
the trajectory using RMSD based clustering of each frame. Docking is performed using the Database
of Useful Decoys - Enhanced (DUD-E) compounds (Mysinger, Carchia, Irwin, & Shoichet, 2012) and
enrichment plots are generated for each conformation. Then select sets of compounds and structures
are rescored using MM/GBSA. The entire workflow is shown in Figure 1. Information on how to run
each step of the workflow can be found at https://github.com/Xiaofei-Zhang.

early enrichment is shown.

2.1 Modeling
The LCK structure was generated using the UniProt primary sequence of human LCK (accession
number P06239-1; (Koga et al., 1986; Perlmutter et al., 1988)) as input for the SWISS-MODEL
Alignment Tool (Arnold, Bordoli, Kopp, & Schwede, 2006). Only residues 65 (or 67 depending on
the PDB template) to 509 were used, as these correspond to the SH regions discussed above. Four
models were built as described in the following. 1) Based on PDB structure 1QCF (Schindler et al.,
1999). This structure is of HCK and chosen based on sequence identity. This model is of the inactive
state. 2) Based on PDB structure 2SRC (Xu, Doshi, Lei, Eck, & Harrison, 1999). This structure is of
c-SRC, a related protein in the SRC-like family. This model is also of the inactive state. 3) Based on
PDB structure 1Y57 (Cowan-Jacob et al., 2005). This structure is of c-SRC in the active state. 4)
Based on PDB structure 1QCF (Schindler et al., 1999) for the structure as a whole and then the
coordinates for the kinase domain are swapped with that of 2PL0 (Jacobs, Caron, & Hare, 2008).
2PL0 is a structure of the kinase domain of LCK with imatinib bound. This model is of the inactive
state with a DFG-out conformation. Sometimes residues at the C-terminus were excluded, including
507, 508, and 509. The C-terminus was extended using Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004). Added
residues were then assigned the most stable rotameric configurations based on the Dunbrack library in
Chimera (Dunbrack, 2002). Protonation states of residues were identified using Protoss (Bietz,
Urbaczek, Schulz, & Rarey, 2014).

2.2 Ensemble Docking
In order to do ensemble docking, molecular dynamics are first done on the resulting LCK models.
The homology model was prepared using the combined CHARMM22 proteins/CHARMM27 nucleic
acids topology and parameter files (MacKerell Jr et al., 1998). Phosphorylation of TYR 505 was
accomplished using the par_all27_prot_na.inp and top_all27_prot_na.inp preparation files (Feng,
Philippopoulos, MacKerell, & Lim, 1996). MD simulations were run using NAMD 2.10 (Phillips et
al., 2005). Before production runs, the system was subject to 400 steps of minimization, 3000 steps of
Berendsen thermostat/barostat equilibration, 100 steps of further minimization, and 3000 steps of
Langevin thermostat/barostat equilibration. Then, one 100 ns production run was performed for each
structure using Langevin thermodynamics. All time steps were 2 femtoseconds (fs), and frames from
the production run were saved every 2 picoseconds (ps). Periodic boundary conditions and Particle
Mesh Ewald (PME) electrostatics were used for all above MD procedures with an electrostatics cutoff
of 12 Å. Seven to eight snapshots from the 100 ns production trajectory were chosen for each model
based on clustering results from GROMOS (Christen et al., 2005).
Active and decoy compounds for LCK were obtained from DUD-E (Mysinger et al., 2012).
Docking was performed using the AutoDock Vina (Trott & Olson, 2010) docking engine and
VinaMPI (Ellingson, Smith, & Baudry, 2013), a virtual screening tool that allows one to perform a
massive number of docking calculations using high performance computing resources. Scripts were
used for automated preparation of pdbqt files. The binding site was determined using the position
where imatinib, a known inhibitor of LCK is bound in a crystal structure (PDB ID: 2PL0 (Jacobs et
al., 2008)). After docking, ranked lists of compounds, in which the top of the list has compounds

1225

Xiaofei Zhang et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1222–1231

1226	

predicted to bind the best, are generated using the docking score for each selected snapshot of each
cluster.

2.3 MM/GBSA
Docking scores from Vina have a small range and therefore a large number of compounds have
the same score. Instead of rescoring an exact percent of each ranked list a cut-off energy value is
chosen to have a list of compounds for rescoring that is the top 4-5% of each list. Prior to MM/GBSA
calculations, minimizations on the protein-ligand conformations predicted from docking structures
were performed using AMBER 12 and AmberTools (Case et al., 2005; Pearlman et al., 1995).
Antechamber, parmchk and tleap tools were used in order to generate parameter files for the ligands.
Complexes were then solvated in tleap using TIP3P explicit waters and 0.15 M KCl. The system was
then subject to 2000 steps of minimization. The protein was held fixed for the first 1000 steps, while
everything was mobile in the last 1000 steps. MM/GBSA calculations were then performed on the
post-minimization structure for each complex. MM/GBSA is performed on the snapshots that come
from the two largest clusters representing conformations in which the protein remained in the longest
during MD simulations and from one shorter lived conformation that had a better docking enrichment
than other conformations as this conformation may be important for drug binding. Multiple ways of
combining MM/GBSA scores from multiple docking poses were evaluated. Parameters were set to
output 20 docking poses, but sometimes less than 20 poses are generated if they are not significantly
different. Because of the best early enrichment and similar results using other models and clusters, the
average of the best 5 scores from processing all generated docking poses is used in all following
MM/GBSA calculations.

3 Results
The DUD-e active and decoy datasets were docked to each snapshot extracted from the MD
trajectories for each model and enrichment plots are given in Figure 2. The figures only display the
top 10% of the ranked compounds as we are interested in improving early enrichment in order to
create experimental test sets that are highly enriched with active compounds. The total AUC for each
cluster is given in the legend though. It can be seen that the snapshot from the first cluster (longest
lived conformation) never has the best AUC. All the models have snapshots that have better than
random enrichments. However, the 2PL0 model only has one snapshot that gets better than average
enrichment overall.
The MM/GBSA results are given in Figure 3. The MM/GBSA calculations are only done on the
top 4-5% of compounds from each cluster. This is because of the computational time to do the
calculations and to test whether or not it can be a step in a multi-tiered approach that increases the
enrichment on subsets of data slightly enriched in previous steps. A docking curve is included on the
plot for comparison. The line given here is an average between the maximum and minimum docking
values obtained from placing all actives before and after the decoys with the same energy. The 2PL0
model gets the best improvement using MM/GBSA and 1QCF has consistently better enrichment
using MM/GBSA over docking. The performance of MM/GBSA over docking for the 2SRC and
1Y57 models is not as good and at times is actually worse.
To further test the worth of ensemble docking, different binding calculations, and the use of
multiple models, we investigated the number of unique actives found using different clusters, models,
and methods which can be seen in Figure 4. The Venn diagrams in the left-most box shows the
overlap of compounds identified in the top 10% of different clusters for each model and method. It
can be seen that identified actives are most often specific to a particular snapshot. A union is done for
the list of actives identified in each cluster and the overlap of actives identified within different

models is given in the top right box. Then a union is done for the list of actives identified in each
model and the overlap of actives identified with different methods is given in the bottom right.

4 Discussion
Protein kinases, one of the largest families of proteins in higher eukaryotes, have over 900 protein
products and contribute to a diversity of cellular processes (Anamika, Garnier, & Srinivasan, 2009).
Protein kinases transfer a phosphate group from a bound ATP molecule to another protein substrate
and regulate the majority of cellular pathways and signal transduction. Since kinase activity is so
integral for normal cellular function, the deregulation of kinases has been implicated in many disease
states, especially in cancers. Additionally, due to the high similarity in both sequence and structure
between many kinases, kinase selectivity is a huge challenge for drug discovery. This in turn leads to
off target effects that may be extremely toxic if drugs additionally interact with kinases that are
normally expressed and not implicated in the given disease in which the drug is intended to relieve.
The SRC family are nonreceptor tyrosine kinases and include c-SRC, LCK, HCK, FYN, BLK,
LYN, FGR, YES, and YRK. The lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) is critical in T
cell development and activation and is expressed through most of the T cell lifespan and at a
somewhat constant rate through their development (Palacios & Weiss, 2004). LCK has implications,
as suggested above, as both a drug target and also a serious off-target in which to avoid unintended

interactions. In fact, LCK is the kinase agreed upon by several pharmaceutical companies in a
consensus minimal toxicity screen. They link LCK activation to T cell activation and LCK inhibition
to T cell inhibition and severe (SCID)-like immunodeficiency which is characterized by devastating
deficiencies in cellular and humoral immunity (Bowes et al., 2012; Goldman et al., 1998). LCK is a
protooncogene (Abraham, Levin, Marth, Forbush, & Perlmutter, 1991) and overexpressed in Burkitt
(Jücker, Abts, Eick, Lenoir, & Tesch, 1991), non-Hodgkin’s B cell lymphoma (Knethen, Abts, Kube,
Diehl, & Tesch, 1997), and lymphocytic leukemias (Majolini et al., 1998). High expression of LCK in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia is linked with lymphocytic cell survival and thus studies suggest using
LCK specific inhibitors for the treatment of progressive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Talab, Allen,
Thompson, Lin, & Slupsky, 2013). It has also been shown that inhibiting LCK enhances the ability
for glucocorticoids to treat lymphoid malignancy, reversing glucocorticoid resistance (Harr et al.,
2010). As many anticancer therapeutics are associated with severe adverse reactions and kinases are
implicated in many cancers, a better understanding of the interactions of drugs with the entire kinome
would give great insight for more efficacious and safe therapies.
Four models of LCK are investigated in this study. Although there are experimental structures for
the kinase domain and the SH1 and SH2 domains of LCK, there are no experimental structures of all
three of these domains intact. In order to have a more complete structure to obtain more accurate
dynamics of the protein and have structures to eventually study alternate binding sites that have been
implicated in kinase drug discover, homology models were built using structures of similar proteins
with all three domains intact. The 1QCF is of the inactive state using HCK as a template based on
sequence identity. The 1Y57 model is of the active state using c-SRC as a template since not many
active structures exist for similar proteins. The 2SRC model is also of the inactive state using c-SRC
as the template to be consistent with the template for the active model. The 2PL0 model is of the
inactive state in a DFG-out conformation. A clustering of public human protein kinase structures has
suggested that the catalytically active structure is similar among kinases and that there are two
frequently observes inactive states called the “DFG-out” and “C-helix-out” states. In the DFG-out
state an Asp sidechain that is part of an Asp-Phe-Gly (DFG) motif is rotated out of the ATP binding
site making a larger pocket. In the C-helix-out state the αC helix is shifted away from the ATP
binding site making a larger pocket. While other structures of inactive SRC-family kinases adopt the
C-helix out conformation, a structure of the LCK kinase only domain bound with imatinib, an
effective treatment of chronic myeloid and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Lee et al., 2010), suggest
that the inactive state of LCK may adopt the DFG-out state (Jacobs et al., 2008). This would support
the finding that imatinib selectively inhibits LCK among SRC-family kinases (Lee et al., 2010) along
with other kinases shown to adopt the DFG-out inactive conformation. However, there are currently
no experimental structures for the combined three SH domains for LCK in the active state or locked in
the inactive state to help support this.
Using the best enrichment from any cluster and average enrichment over all of the clusters, the
order of performance of each model with docking scores is, from best to worst, 2SRC, 1QCF, 1Y57,
and 2PL0. This could indicate that the active compounds preferentially target the inactive state of the
protein which is normally in the C-helix-out conformation. However, it may sometimes exist in the
DFG-out conformation, but less and/or different active compounds bind to this conformation. Most
models have some improvement with the MM/GBSA calculations except for 2SRC which actually
has decreased performance. Since this model was best performing by docking calculations, it seems
that this model is well suited for docking and that methods are definitely model dependent. The
greatest improvement by far is with the 2PL0 model. This could be because the active compounds
identified in docking truly do bind to the DFG-out conformation and MM/GBSA performed well at
rescoring these active compounds to this conformation.
Finally, to test the usefulness of using different conformations, models, and methods, we analyzed
how many unique compounds are identified with each variation. It can be seen in Figure 4 that each
variation gives information on different active compounds. Most of the identified actives are common

	

Xiaofei Zhang et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 1222–1231

with both methods, but a large number of different actives are identified with each method, with
MM/GBSA recovering more. If you use multiple ways of coming up with a set of compounds to test,
you will also add to your false positives, and could likely get the same number of positive active
compounds by just increasing the percent of compounds experimentally tested from an initial
screening. However, using the approach here may provide insight into how the drug is interacting
with the protein and provide useful information further down the drug development pipeline.

5 Conclusions
Although the MM/GBSA results do not always out perform the docking results, we show here that
different variations in the drug screening process provide unique results which can be used to better
understand the biological mechanisms underlying the drug interactions. Of the four models
investigated, two of them consistently get better results and two get varying results using MM/GBSA.
Future directions of this work include further tuning of the MM/GBSA calculations. Since the
MM/GBSA calculations were done on the set of compounds with the best docking score for each
cluster, the set of compounds with MM/GBSA scores is not consistent across clusters. Future work
will involve calculations to screen a larger, consistent set of compounds to test if combining
information across clusters can improve scores. Also, a third tier of increased theoretical accuracy,
such as with density functional theory is being discussed.
