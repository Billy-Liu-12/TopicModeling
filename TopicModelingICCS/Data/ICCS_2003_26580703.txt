Abstract. With the explosive popularity of the Internet, the number of
accessible web servers has proliferated as well. Subsequently, malicious
attacks on these servers via viruses have become more prevalent. Due
to the self-propagation and self-duplication nature of these viruses, such
attacks can congest the network quickly, aggravating the already limited
bandwidth available and curtail service provided by the server, eventually
leading to denial of all services. The IIS, in particular, has been gravely
aﬀected by such Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Hence, various methods
to prevent such attacks from aﬀecting the network and server have been
researched and proposed. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of
worm virus attack traﬃcs, by extracting and analyzing virus attack logs.
With the use of various statistical methods, we show that worm attack
patterns show self-similarity with Hurst parameter H. Our purpose is to
use this characteristic in annulling the negative eﬀects of worm attacks.

Introduction

The number of the web servers has proliferated with the explosive popularity of
Internet, especially with the advent of the World Wide Web (WWW) and its
various services. Simultaneously, computer virus attacks on web servers over the
Internet have also increased. Due to viruses’ charateristic to self-propagate, the
number of attacking packets of viruses tend to increase exponentially, eventually leading to network congestion. Web servers, the IIS in particular, are usual
victims of such Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. It is imperative to recognize
the pattern of such virus attacks in order to take measure to defend from such
attacks.
It has been well known that network traﬃc shows self-similarity. It is also
well known that the WWW traﬃc shows self-similar charateristics[1]. However,
there have been little research on self-similar characteristics of traﬃc generated
by viruses that attack web servers. So, we analyzed the viruses’ requests that
attack web servers and measured whether the distribution of those requests seems
to be self-similar. The requests of viruses are a subset of the total requests to
web servers and the distribution of the total requests for web servers are selfsimilar. Hence, checking to see whether the distribution of the requests of viruses
that attack web servers are self-similar is an interesting endeavor, as if it is so,
this characteristic could be used to defend against such attacks. We analyzed

and measured the requests of the worms which attack the IIS using the logs
made by the Apache web server. We were ablt to verify that the distribution
of worms’ requests are self-similar with self-similarity parameter H, that is, the
Hurst parameter,.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews related works. Section 3 introduces self-similarity and summarizes statistical tests
for self-similarity. Section 4 describes worm viruses’ properties and attacking
pattern. We analyze the real data of logs of attacking web server in Section 5
and conclude with directions for future research in Section 6.

Related Works

There are a considerable number of statistical studies about traﬃcs of network
and WWW [1][2]. Early studies are about the self-similarity of network traﬃcs,
e.g. LAN, WAN, etc. [2][3], and later studies are about the self-similarity of
WWW traﬃcs [1], video stream traﬃcs [4], wavelets [5], etc. For viruses, vaccines are made in general by analyzing occurrence day, properties, and factors
of danger, and a real state of worms, recently run actively, is researched about
the ways of attacks and recovery [6][7]. Therefore, the work presented here is
diﬀerent from existing studies that serves as a means to cure the viruses in that
the study of traﬃc patterns of worm’s attacking web servers is presented as a
startng point to safeguard servers from work attacks. There are two basic related
topics that relate to our research: fractal and self-similarity.
2.1

Fractal

Fractal is something that has characteristics of self-similarity and recursiveness
[8]. Fractal’s characteristic can be derived from a Fractal diagram. A Fractal
diagram is similar to its sub-diagram and its area is ﬁnite but its circumference
is inﬁnite.
2.2

Self-Similarity

Self-similarity follows the self-similarity and recursiveness properties of a Fractal. A self-similar object is also similar to its subset from a statistical view. It
manages a time process or a time series with time parameter t as shown in
ﬁgure 1. Figure 1 shows a sort of network traﬃc and it is similar to a Fractal
diagram with the change of the scale of time unit. This characteristic is called
Self-similarity.

The Mathematics of Self-Similarity

We will summarize the mathematical and statistical techniques regarding selfsimilarity that will be used to analyze the traﬃc patterns of worm attacks.

Mathematical Foundation of Self-Similarity

Stationarity and second-order self-similarity are theoretical basis underlining
self-similarity. This subsection describes the mathematical and statistical foundations of stationarity and the derivation of self-similarity [9].
Stationarity and Second-order Stationarity. We denote the time series as
follows.
X(t) is time series, where t ∈ N and N is a natural number.
We denote the time series with a cumulative parameter of time t as Y (t). We
will then reserve X(t) to be the increment process corresponding to Y (t), that
is,
X(t) = Y (t) − Y (t − 1) .

(1)

For traﬃc modeling purposes, X(t) has to be stationary, which means
that the behavior and structure of X(t) are the same as one that is shifted
in some time. X(t) is strictly stationary if (X(t1 ), X(t2 ), · · · , X(tn )) and
(X(t1+1 ), X(t2+1 ), · · · , X(tn+1 )) has the same joint distribution for all n, tn , k ∈
Z. Hence, when we denote Xk as the k-shifted time process or time series, X
and Xk are said to be equivalent in the sense of ﬁnite-dimensional distributions,
and we denote it as follows.
X =d Xi .

(2)

Stationarity is too strict to implement in real processes, henceforth a weaker
form of stationarity is used in general and is called second-order stationarity.
Second-order stationarity is weaker than stationarity, and it requires the autocovariance function as follows.
γ(r, s) = E [(X(r) − µ) (X(s) − µ)] .

(3)

When γ(r, s) has to satisfy the translation invariance as follows.
γ(r, s) = γ(r + k, s + k)

(for all r, s, k ∈ Z) .

(4)
2

Suppose that there are r, s which are ﬁnite, and we set µ = E[X(t)], ρ =
2
E[(X(t) − µ) )] for all t ∈ Z. And also assume µ = 0, then γ(r, s) = γ(r − s, 0)
by stationarity, and it is denoted the autocovariance by γ(k).
We deﬁne X (m) , the aggregated process of X at aggregation level m, to
formulate scale invariance as follows.
X (m) (i) =

1
m

m×i

X(t) .

(5)

t=m(i−1)+1

That is, X(t) is partitioned into nonoverlapping blocks of size m, their values
are averaged and i is used to index these blocks. We denote γ (m) (k) to be the
autocovariance function of X (m) . Under the supposition of this second-order
stationarity, we can deﬁne the second-order self-similarity.

706

Second-order Self-similarity. X(t) is second-order self-similar with Hurst
parameter H if
ρ2
2H
(6)
((k + 1) − 2k 2H + (k − 1)2H ) .
2
where γ(k) is the autocovariance function of X(t), ρ2 is the variance of X(t)
and H is Hurst parameter. And X(t) is asymptotically second-order self-similar
when X(t) satisﬁes the following.
γ(k) =

lim γ (m) (k) =

m→∞

ρ2
((k + 1)2H − 2k 2H + (k − 1)2H ) .

(7)

Distributional Self-similarity. Consider the cumulative process Y (t) mentioned in section 3.1. Y (t) is self-similar with self-similarity parameter H
(0 < H < 1), that is, the Hurst parameter, denoted H-ss, if
Y (t) =d a−H Y (at)

(∀ a, t,

a > 0, t ≥ 0) .

(8)

That is Y (t), and its time scaled and normalized version have the same
distribution. Suppose Y (t) has these ﬁnite variances as follows.
E [Y (t)] = 0,
E Y 2 (t) = ρ2 |t|2H ,
ρ2
|t|2H − |t − s|2H + |s|2H
γ(k) =
2
Thus, Y (t) can be deﬁned as follows.
Y (t) =d tH Y (1)

(Y (t) =d a−H Y (at),

And also suppose X(t), we can show X
X (m) =

t = 1, a = t) .

(9)

as follows.

m

X(t)

i=1
−1

= m (Y (m) − Y (0))
=d m−1 mH (Y (1) − Y (0))
= mH−1 X .
Therefore, if Y (t) shows H-self-similarity and has stationarity increments,
denoted H-sssi, then its increment process X (m) satisﬁes the following.
X (m) =d mH−1 X

(10)

And X(t) is exactly self-similar or asymptotically self-similar if
lim =d mH−1 X

m→∞

(11)

for all m, m ≥ 0. In this paper, we say that X is self-similar with parameter
H when X satisﬁes the following.
Xt =d m−H

And also, a time series X is self-similar with parameter H if it and X (m) have

H has to satisfy the following.

Statistical Tests for Self-Similarity

This section presents statistical methodologies for self-similarity. These statistical methodologies are variance-time plot, R/S plot, periodogram, etc. [1].
Variance-time plot. var(X (m) ), the variance of X (m) for large number m, is
plotted against m on a log-log plot. Suppose β is an approximate slope of the
plotted distribution, and H satisﬁes H = 1 − β/2. Then X (m) is self-similar with
parameter H if 12 < H < 1.
R/S plot. The rescaled version X (m) by R/S is plotted against n on a log-log
plot. R and S are denoted as follows.
S(n) = var(X (m) ),
R(n) = [max(0, W1 , W2 , · · · , Wn ) − min(0, W1 , W2 , · · · , Wn )]
Wk = (X1 + X2 + · · · + Xk ) − kX(n),
k = 1, 2, · · · , n
Thus, H is the estimated slope of the graph on a log-log plot, and X (m) is
self-similar with parameter H if 12 < H < 1.
Periodogram. The periodogram is plotted on a log-log plot. A periodogram
can be formulated as follows.

I(λ) =
2πN

N

Xj eijλ

(14)

j=1

where λ is a period and N is the number of series. Suppose β is an approximate slope of the plotted distribution, and H satisﬁes H = 1 − β/2. Then, X (m)
is self-similar with parameter H if 12 < H < 1.

Worm Attacks against the Web Server over the
Internet

Worm attacks against general servers as well as web servers have increased
tremendously. In particular, the Internet Information Server (IIS) [10] is the
most popular target of these web server attacks. IIS is a product of Microsoft
and runs on the Windows operating system. Hackers frequently choose the IIS as
their target due to its weak security. Though IIS provides security measures as
fast as possible, new attacks continue to appear as rapidly as these new measures
are provided.
A typical attack method of a virus is to infect the system and attack the ﬁle
system. However, in recent years, the attacks are inﬂicted so that the infected
system also becomes an attacker inﬂicting harm to neighboring systems or
thereby congesting the network itself. Virus attacks on web servers also take this
form, infecting all of clients connected to the infected web server or attacking
the web server by a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. For example, Code Red
and Nimda Worm(W32/Nimda worm) are a couple of the more well known
notorious ones. Particularly, the Nimda worm, which appeared later than Code
Red, acts intelligently by searching the back door, which was made by the
Code Red virus. The attack patterns of the Nimda worm are described as follows.

The attack logs between line (1) and line (4) are attempts to search the
back door made by the Code Red virus and the other logs are to attack the
weakness of the directory traversal.

Characterization of Worm Attack Traﬃcs

We used log data that was made by the Apache web server of the Department of
Computer Engineering, Hongik Univ. This section describes information of log
data and the web server system, and explains the results of the data analysis.
5.1

Collection of Worm Attack Traﬃc Logs

The almost attacks against web servers are concentrated onto the MS Windows
and IIS, and cannot attack UNIX systems and the Apache web server [11]. The
failed worm virus attacks are written on the log ﬁles of the Apache web server,
thus we could collect a large amount of logs. The size of raw log data is 343MB

Traﬃc Characterization of the Web Server Attacks of Worm Viruses

709

and the size of attack data is 13MB. The web server system runs on the Apache
version 1.3.9 on the SUN SPARC station-10 using UNIX System V release 4.0
(SunOS 5.5). The duration for gathering the log data is from 10/1/2001 00:00
to 2/28/2002 24:00.
5.2

Self-Similarity of Worm Attack Traﬃcs

Figure 1 shows the distribution of the log data at time unit 1, 10, 100, and
1000 of worm attack traﬃc patterns. The x-axis is for time and y-axis is for the
number of attacks at time x. We can see that the distributions of each time unit
are all similar in Figure 1. It seems to shows that the distribution pattern of web
server attacks is self-similar.

Fig. 1. The measured frequency of worm attacks over time domain.

Figure 2 shows a variance-time plot. The dotted line is the value of the
variance and the solid line is the approximate line calculated by the method of
least squares. We found the value of β on a log-log plot to be 0.65 and the value
of parameter H to be 0.67.
Figure 3 shows a R/S plot. In Figure 3, concentrated plotting of dots express
the value of r/s, and the value of n on the x-axis is the same as the value of m

at X (m) . The slopes of the two lines above and under the dots are 0.5 and 1,
respectively, showing that H is between 0.5 and 1. The real value of parameter
H is 0.57.
Finally, Figure 4 shows a periodogram. The dots represent the values of the
periodogram, and the line among dots is the approximate line identiﬁed by the
least squares method. The value of the slope of β is 0.11, and so the value of
parameter H is 0.94.
All three methods shown that parameter H satisﬁes the condition 12 < H < 1.
Therefore we may safely conclude that the attack pattern of worm viruses is selfsimilar with parameter H.

Conclusions and Future Works

In this paper, we have analyzed the request distribution of attacking web servers
by worm viruses. From the fact that most of the worm attacks are concentrated
on the IIS of Windows platforms, we could collect logs of worm attacks on the
Apache web servers on UNIX systems. These logs were analyzed to obtain the
characteristics of the attacks. We used statistical methods, e.g. variance-time
plot, R/S plot and periodogram to test for self-similarity. We found the request
distribution of worm attacks is self-similar with parameter H. Therefore we can
determine worm attacks and defend against such attacks by using the value of
parameter H.
For the future works, we plan to consider the possibility of detecting worm attacks in real time by using parameter H, thereby blocking or taking appropriate
action to such attacks as it happens.
