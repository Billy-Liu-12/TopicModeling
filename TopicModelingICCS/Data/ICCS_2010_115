Abstract
Artiﬁcial neural networks have been recognized as an important technique in microwave modeling and optimization. This paper gives an overview and recent developments on the knowledge based neural modeling techniques in
microwave modeling and design. The knowledge based artiﬁcial neural networks are constructed by incorporating
the existing knowledge such as empirical formulas, equivalent circuit models and semi-analytical equations in neural
network structures. The existing knowledge reduces the complexity of neural network model. This combination
requires less training data and has better extrapolation performance than classical neural networks. The advantages of
using knowledge based neural network modeling are demonstrated with two microwave modeling applications such as
characteristic impedance modeling of thin-ﬁlm microstrip line and parametric modeling of the diﬀerential via holes.

1. Introduction
The recent developments in computer aided design tools have increased model reliability and accuracy for
RF/microwave design [1, 2, 3, 4]. These developments have additionally brought in complex mathematical
relationship necessary in realizing RF/microwave device modeling. These complex but accurate models need much
more time compared to equivalent circuit models.
Nowadays the accurate and fast models begin to take crucial role for statistical analysis and yield optimization.
Artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) modeling [5, 6, 7] oﬀers a useful tool for RF and microwave modeling and design
due to the simple mathematical relations which reduce the computational burden. ANN modeling only needs inputoutput pairs obtained from detailed physical/EM simulation models or measurements and generate approximate
results depending on their training set and topological structure. Training data must be provided to characterize
the component to be modeled over a desired range of operation and for diﬀerent combinations of geometrical and
physical model inputs. Large amount of training data is usually needed to improve model accuracy. Generating large
amount of training data could be time consuming for microwave problems. Consequently, knowledge based modeling
strategy facilitates to reduce the need of large set of training data using existing knowledge during microwave modeling
process.
In RF/microwave design, vast amount of knowledge are available such as empirical formulas, equivalent circuit
models, and semi-analytical equations. Knowledge based modeling has incorporated neural network modeling with

these existing knowledge. In this approach, the existing knowledge and ANN structure is combined to create an overall
model [8, 9, 10, 11]. The existing knowledge is used to reduce the complexity of the new model to be developed. This
hybrid structure provides more accurate models than ANN models and oﬀers less computational burden compared to
detailed physical/EM simulation models.
This paper summarizes recent developments about knowledge based approach. First of all, knowledge based
modeling will be generally discussed and the several methods related to this technique such as diﬀerence method,
knowledge based neural network, prior knowledge input, space mapping neural network, and prior knowledge input
with diﬀerence will be discussed in detail throughout Section 2. Finally the modeling applications in microwave
engineering will be presented to show the advantages of using knowledge based techniques in Section 3.
2. Overview of knowledge based modeling techniques
ANN [2, 5, 6] has emerged as a powerful technique for modeling general input-output relationship as shown in
ﬁg.1(a). ANN has been widely utilized for modeling purpose in many disciplines such as RF/microwave design,
control, communication, pattern recognition, signal processing, etc. [2]. The main reason for ANN being such
popular among other modeling techniques is that ANN needs only input-output information without any knowledge
about the physical model. ANN modeling process and explanatory numeric example are shown in ﬁg.1(a) and ﬁg.1(b),
respectively. In RF/microwave design, accurate models of active/passive components can be obtained through detailed
physical/EM simulation models but they are computationally intensive, so these are called ﬁne model. In contrast,
empirical formulations or equivalent circuit models have less computational burden but they are not as accurate as ﬁne
model, so these are called coarse model. Mathematical ﬁne and coarse model examples are selected to explain model
structure as shown in ﬁg.1(b). Let (x f , Y f ) and (xc , Yc ) be input-output vectors of ﬁne and coarse models, respectively.
The relationship f between x f and Y f can be nonlinear and multi-dimensional. In addition input-output relationship of
the ﬁne model is much more complex than the coarse model’s ( fc ). In this case, these relationships can be represented
by
(1)
Y f = f (x f )
Yc = fc (xc )

(2)

ANN is well suited for time consuming models of detailed physical/EM structures (ﬁne model). Input-output variables
are selected considering the physical structure and the data set necessary for training of ANN are also obtained from

physical/EM simulations or measurements. Training phase of ANN is represented by dotted line and error value is
equal to diﬀerence between ﬁne and ANN responses as shown in ﬁg.1(a). Bold box represents ﬁnal ANN model for
test phase as shown in ﬁg.1(a). Let ANN model be represented by
YANN = fANN (x f )

(3)

where YANN represents ANN responses obtained from ANN model represented by fANN as shown in ﬁg.1.
Although ANN modeling techniques provide eﬃcient strategy for this area, designers would like to add their
special experience and available knowledge of the physical/EM models. Knowledge based modeling oﬀers some
opportunities to exploit existing knowledge to improve modeling eﬃciency. The aim of choosing this technique is to
get better extrapolation and utilize less training data for modeling [2]. There are various approaches in knowledge
based modeling strategies and many of them will be introduced in following subsections.
2.1. Diﬀerence method (DM)
The diﬀerence method [12, 13] is one of the earlier methods utilizing knowledge based concept. The target
response of diﬀerence method is the diﬀerence between ﬁne model and coarse model (existing approximate model)
responses. The coarse model imposes general knowledge behavior of the ﬁne model, thus extrapolation performance
and generalization capacity of diﬀerence method increase while the number of training set decreases. In ﬁg.2(a),
training phase and ﬁnal model of diﬀerence method are denoted as the dotted line and the bold box, respectively.
Input-output relationship of diﬀerence method is represented by
Y f ≈ YDM = Yc + fANN (x f )

(4)

Yd

where YDM represents response of diﬀerence method, Yd is the diﬀerence between ﬁne and coarse model responses
as shown in ﬁg.2. The advantages of diﬀerence method are clearly shown in ﬁg.2(b). Due to simplifying complexity
of input-output relationship, not only complexity of ANN topology but also number of training set can be reduced
depending on the coarse model.

2.2. Knowledge based neural network method (KBNN)
Knowledge based neural network as shown in ﬁg.3 is a modeling approach combining microwave empirical or
semi-analytical information with ANN learning process with internal modiﬁcation of ANN structure [14, 15]. The
microwave existing knowledge is embedded into ANN internal structure instead of nonlinear activation function which
provides a general approximation for all problem types while microwave knowledge is speciﬁc and its behavior is only
focused on modeling problem. There are six layers in the structure, namely the input layer, the knowledge layer, the
boundary layer, the region layer, the normalized region layer and the output layer. The input layer is composed
of external inputs to the model. The knowledge layer contains knowledge neurons whose activation functions are
empirical/semi-analytical functions. The boundary layer can incorporate knowledge in the form of problem-dependent
boundary functions. The region layer contains neurons to construct regions from boundary neurons. The normalized
region layer contains rational function-based neurons to normalize the output of region layer. The output layer consists
of second-order neurons combining outputs of the knowledge neurons and normalized region neurons. Knowledge
based neural network model enhances neural model accuracy, especially generalization and extrapolation capacity
and reduces the need for a large amount of training data.
2.3. Prior knowledge input method (PKI)
Prior knowledge input method as shown in ﬁg.4 was proposed in [13]. The coarse model responses are used
as extra inputs to ANN in addition to ﬁne model inputs. This extra knowledge enables ANN to learn input-output
relationship more easily than a pure ANN structure. As shown in ﬁg.4(a), input-output relationship is represented by
Y f ≈ YPKI = fANN (x f , Yc )

(5)

where YPKI is the ﬁnal model responses obtained from ANN model with extra inputs. Since the coarse model provides
general knowledge about ﬁne model behavior, ANN also consider the ﬁne model characteristic to provide an eﬃcient
model. ANN generates feasible response not only in training region but also in extrapolation region through extra
knowledge. Training and test phases are shown in ﬁg.4(a). Explanatory simple example for modeling is shown in
ﬁg.4(b).

2.4. Space mapping neural network method (SMNN)
Space mapping neural network [16, 17, 18, 19] method as shown in ﬁg.5 establishes a mathematical link between
input space of ﬁne and coarse models. Inputs of the coarse model are changed to satisfy more accurate results
than coarse model and less computational burden than ﬁne model via input mapping. This mapping is constructed
using ANN structure through its nonlinear behavior. The ﬁne model generally consists of EM simulator or direct
measurements while the coarse model typically consists of empirical functions or equivalent circuit models. The

mapping structure and input-output relationship are represented by
Y f ≈ YS MNN = fc ( f p (x f ))

(6)

YANN

where YS MNN is the ﬁnal model responses obtained from the coarse model. Mapping f p uses fANN to construct
mathematical link from x f to xc as shown in ﬁg.5(a).
The parameter extraction process takes a crucial role to improve the performance of modeling. Inputs of the coarse
model corresponding to target response are obtained from coarse model optimization using the process as shown in
ﬁg.5(a). Space mapping neural network combines the computational eﬃciency of coarse model with accuracy of ﬁne
model using nonlinear input mapping. Mapping structure for numeric example is shown in ﬁg.5(b).
2.5. Prior knowledge input with diﬀerence method (PKI-D)
Prior knowledge input with diﬀerence as shown in ﬁg.6 is developed [9] to exploit advantages of two knowledge
based methods, prior knowledge input and diﬀerence method. The extra knowledge obtained from coarse model is
utilized besides inputs of the ﬁne model. ANN construct nonlinear mapping from extended input space with coarse
model response to diﬀerence between ﬁne and coarse model responses. In this model as shown in ﬁg.6(a), the extra
prior knowledge and the diﬀerence target ensure more accurate ANN and less complex mathematical relationship
comparing to pure ANN structure. As shown in ﬁg.6(a) input-output relationship is represented by
Y f ≈ YPKI−D = Yc + fANN (x f , Yc )

(7)

Yd

where YPKI−D is the ﬁnal model responses obtained from summation of the coarse model and ANN responses. fANN
is ANN model with extra inputs to obtain diﬀerence Yd between Y f and Yc as shown in ﬁg.6(a). The training and test
phases of this model are shown in ﬁg6(a). The numeric example to explain modeling structure is shown in ﬁg6(b).
Since PKI-D method combines prior extra knowledge within less output range through twice knowledge utilization,
it introduces very eﬃcient strategy both modeling and output correction [11] for CAD applications.

3. Microwave modeling applications
In this part, two microwave applications will be examined to demonstrate modeling performance of knowledge
based modeling techniques. First, prior knowledge input method, diﬀerence method and prior knowledge input with
diﬀerence method will be used for characteristic impedance modeling of thin-ﬁlm microstrip line. Second, space
mapping neural network method will be used to obtain S-parameters for diﬀerential via holes.
3.1. Characteristic impedance modeling of thin-ﬁlm microstrip line
The structure of thin-ﬁlm microstrip line [20] is illustrated in ﬁg.7. The characteristic impedance of thin-ﬁlm
microstrip line [9] is modeled via changes in parameters: conductor thickness (t), conductor width (w) and substrate
height (h). Hence, the model uses these parameters to obtain characteristic impedance (Ω). The ﬁne model response
corresponding to the characteristic impedance of thin-ﬁlm microstrip line is obtained using simulator called TraceSim
and the coarse model response is obtained using the empirical formula obtained from equivalent circuit model for
thin-ﬁlm microstrip line [20]. Characteristic impedance modeling is examined to demonstrate the performance of
knowledge based modeling techniques such as, prior knowledge input method, diﬀerence method and prior knowledge
input with diﬀerence method. In this application, multi layer perceptron (MLP)-ANN with single hidden layer is used.
MLP-ANN trained with 10 and 50 data uses 20 hidden neurons in order to model knowledge based techniques. The
comparisons of the errors obtained from MLP, PKI, DM, PKI-D and coarse model are illustrated for 25 test data.
Training and test data intervals are shown in table1. As shown in table1, test data produce extrapolation performance
of these techniques for some parameters. Test errors and average test errors are shown in ﬁg.8. The test results
show that knowledge based techniques generate a more eﬃcient model than conventional ANN model in terms of
extrapolation and data usage.
3.2. Diﬀerential via holes modeling
The SMNN technique is applied to the broadband and parametric modeling of the diﬀerential via holes on the
multilayered printed circuit board. Diﬀerential via hole in multi-layer circuit is considered as 26 layers [21]. At high
signal speed, the signal integrity problems will emerge because of EM eﬀect in the via hole. Therefore, an accurate

and parametric via model is so essential to take into account EM eﬀects in the via hole. In the ﬁrst part of SMNN
model, inputs of ANN mapping contain six geometrical variables of diﬀerential via holes, such as diameter of via
holes (Dh ), diameter of pads (D p ), width of anti-pads (Wa ), length of anti-pads (La ), length of via holes (Lh ), length
of stubs (L s ) as shown in ﬁg.9. The outputs of ANN consist of ﬁve independent circuit elements in the equivalent
circuit. Parameter extraction process is used to ﬁnd input variables in equivalent circuit corresponding to ﬁne model
responses. Training and testing data are generated from EM simulator (HFSS). The comparison results obtained by
testing geometry for SMNN, EM simulation and measurement are shown in ﬁg.10.
4. Conclusion
We have presented an overview for new developments of knowledge based modeling techniques in RF/microwave
modeling and design. ANN modeling provides eﬃcient strategy for microwave modeling and design. Nevertheless,
ANN model needs large amount of training data to ensure suﬃcient model accuracy. Large amount of data
involve more usage of expensive ﬁne model. If it is possible to obtain knowledge about detailed physical/EM
simulation models or measurements, knowledge based techniques can be utilized to provide better extrapolation and

generalization performance than conventional ANN structure. Use of knowledge based techniques have been shown to
reduce the amount of training data needed for ANN model development. This is particularly useful when input-output
pairs obtained from ﬁne model are time consuming. Moreover knowledge based strategy facilitates the combination
of diﬀerent kind of models at the same time, providing better accuracy and speed for microwave design process.
