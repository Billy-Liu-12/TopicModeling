title of papers, patents, university foundations, sci-tech projects etc. We note that traditional multiword entity recognition is not applicable to our compound NER problem duo to two causes: First,
compound named entities often span multiple words or entities in long distances and have huge structural
differences. Second, compound entity is very sparse in Internet, as there are very little texts containing
the same compound entity. Thus, it is impossible to locate compound entities through statistical learning
algorithms. This paper tries to give the first and practicable approach on this problem. Figure 1 gives
our weak supervised framework from community division perspective to achieve the recognition of
compound entities. First,we use traditional POS tagging to label the basic entities among the raw texts.
Second, we run rough extraction by regular expression produced by context pattern which collocate
with compound entities. Third, we map the matched ordered words and basic entities to a undirected
weighted “word-graph” network like figure 2. Then, we find the optimal dividing of network and verify
wether each divided community constitute a compound entities. Finally, we verify each community of
ordered words and preliminary entities wether consists of a compound entities.
Research on NER starts at 1990s. Prior NER work mainly focus on identifying the names of persons, organizations, locations etc. There exists burgeoning specific NER tasks such as query log NER [3],
biomedical NER [14, 2], chemical NER [9], social network events NER [5, 4, 7] etc. Our work is also
related to NLP task of quality phrase (muti-word semantic unit) mining [6] and word sequence segmentation. Earlier works of mutiword phrase segmentation use predefined POS patterns or annotations
to learn rules on POS-tagged dataset [8, 12]. Those types of methodology is not generic in domains
and dependant on expensive manual notation, which make it challenging to their widespread application. Despite great efforts have been made on multiwords named entities recognition and segmentation,
most of them focus on simple entities or sci-tech terms on specific domains and heuristic rules. The
problem of recognizing compound entities in hybrid domains consisting of multi-entities, noun phrases,
conjunctions, which has complicated structure and longer length, is still far from being solved.

Our Approach
Template Extraction

We use Gibbs sampling to compute each word’s topic distribution p(z = k|w) in Equation 1 iteratively.
(t)
(k)
Its each step is updated by the new nk and nm , which is sampled from multinomial distributions
generated by Dir(
α + nk ) and Dir(β + nm ). We take the highest probability of words p(w|z = k)
in each topic k as the template words when Gibbs sampling algorithm converge. We use these template
words to scan the left context reversely from compound entities and right context from forward direction.
The matched template words constitute the regular expression for context templates.

Text splitting and Segmentation Validating

In section 2.1, although compound entities are extracted roughly by mean of regular expression templates. Extracted texts are still likely mixed with unrelated contents. So more accurate extraction is
needed for further splitting compound entities. We map the text tagged with words and basic entities
to a undirected “word graph”.To obtain the optimal division, we introduce the modified concept of
modularity. The definition of network modularity is :
Q(S) =

1 
ki kj 
δ(γ(i), γ(j))
)δ (γ(i), γ(j)), where δ  (γ(i), γ(j)) =
(Aij −
2m
2m
|seg(i, j)|

(2)

i,j∈S

where A
ij is the weight of edge ij from node i to node j. ki is the total weight sum of node i.
m = 12 ij Aij . m denotes the sum of weight for the entire word graph network. γ(i) is the index that community i belongs to. δ(γ(i), γ(j)) is the Kronecker delta function that measures the node i and j are belongs to the same community. If γ(i) = γ(j), then δ(γ(i), γ(j)) = 1, otherwise
δ(γ(i), γ(j)) = 0. Considering the original community modularity didn’t take into account the effect
of segment’s length in the same community, we introduce the modified Kronecker delta δ  (γ(i), γ(j)),
which normalized by length of the community segment. Here we use |seg(i, j)| to represent the length
of segment which wi and wj collocate in. In order to satisfy the limitation that community division does
not breach the sequential relation of original text, we use the linear word graph community division
algorithm to solve the division problem. We use three type of edge weight between word wi and wj :
special marker based weightAsm (wi , wj ), wikipedia term based weightAwt (wi , wj ) and POS2Vector
based weightAp2v (wi , wj ). As mentioned above, the weight between two nodes is a quantification of
the tightness between those two words or entities. For two words w1 and w2 , the weight between them
is defined as :Aij = (Asm (wi , wj ) + Awt (wi , wj )) × Ap2v (wi , wj )
Special Marker Based Weight: In most texts, special markers in pairs, such as quotation marks,
are used to emphasize or note some special phrases that may consist of multiple words. Thus, two
words in the same pair of special markers should be given greater weight. We define the special marker
based weight between wi and wj as: Asm (wi , wj ) = eDs (wi ,wj ) × Issm (wi , wj ) , where Ds (wi , wj )
represents the word distance from one to the other in s, and Issm (wi , wj ) is boolean function which
indicates whether wi and wj are in the same pair of special markers in s.
Wikipedia Term Based Weight: As compound entities usually contain Wikipedia terms, in this
wj in s, we define the Wikipedia term based weight
paper for a segment s and two words wi and

between wi and wj as: Awt (wi , wj ) =

w∈s

|s |−



I(w)

w∈s

I(w)+1

× I(wi ) × I(wj ) where s is a segment of s that

lies between wi and wj . Boolean function I(w) indicates whether word w is a Wikipedia term. This
implies that the value of Awt (wi , wj ) will be higher if there are more Wikipedia terms between wi and
wj in s.
POS2Vector Based Weight: As stated in Observation 4, some POSes rarely occurs in compound
entities. The main idea of computing such POSes’s distance is embedding each POS type into latent
vector space and measuring the POS2Vector based weight between two words based on the cosine
similarity for the vectors of their POS types. For any two words wi and wj , we define the POS2Vector
based weight between wi and wj as the embedding similarity of POSes trained by POSes series corpus.
We use dynamic programming algorithm [13] to make linear segmentation on input series. To determine
whether given segments are sci-tech compound entities, we use indicative words for validation. Relaxing
the restrictions on the construction of indicative words set (denoted as W) will cause over-matching
for compound named entities, and tightening the restrictions will lead to low recall rate of compound
entities. We define the problem of constructing indicative words as follows. Let W denote set of a
words that constitute all the compound entities and R denote set of b compound entities. We construct

a binary a × b matrix M , where element mij = 1 if word wi ∈ W occurs in compound entities rj ∈ R
. We want to find the minimum set G(M ) ⊆ W , where ∀r ∈ R should contain at least one word in
G(M ). F (M ) denotes the scale of indicative word set. We use dynamic programming algorithm to
solve the NP-hard problem.
w = min{F (M  wi ) | 1 ≤ i ≤ a} F (M ) = F (M  w) + 1, G(M ) = G(M  w) ∪ {w} (3)
wi

We introduce the binary operator M  wi to represent removing corresponding row i and all the column
j where mij = 1. The final result of G(M ) is W we desire.

Experimental Results

To our knowledge, there are no available benchmark datasets for our proposed compound entity recognition. We collect 1119 university foundations in various academic fields supported by the National
Natural Science Foundation of China in 2014. We use those compound entities to get the result of indicative words set (denoted as W) and obtain the embedding POS2Vector. We collect 1869 web texts
that each contains one or several sci-tech projects names that won the National Science and Technology
Progress Award between 2005 and 2014 (NSTPA) and 5022 corpus from Wanfang patent. Each of them
contains one or several sci-tech compound entities. Due to the heavy cost of manual annotation, we
only label 681 texts of NSTPA (NSTPA-681) as the baseline dataset for comparison and utilize 10-fold
cross-validation for the train/test split. We also collect 5022 text from Wanfang patent database which
each of them contains at least one compound entities (wPatent) and 766 web texts that each of them
do not contain any compound named entity from Sougou Lab Data [10] (SOUGOU).
Gibbs sampling parameter: We first select 234 members of corpus from NSTPA-681, 679 members from NSTPA and 486 members from wPatent to learn and generate context templates. We manually confirm 32, 103 and 49 template words from the selected datasets respectively, which means the topic number K of the LDA model is set as 32, 103 and 49 on selected dataset. We use
perplexity
[1] to quantify the quality of our estimation. Perplexity is defined as perplexity(D) =

log(p(−

}, where Nm is the number of words in each piece of corpus. A lower perplexiexp − { m−1

ty score denotes better generalization performance in practice. We choose the best of α and β as 0.0001
and 0.00001 on NSTPA and wPatent from lowest perplexity and run 5000, 5000 and 4000 iterative
steps on three dataset respectively until converge to get the template.

Table 1 shows the experimental results of GenericSegVal and bidirectional LSTM approach on our
experimental sets. We can find that GenericSegVal gives exciting results on classifying compound
entities. Specifically, GenericSegVal achieves 72.4% recall rate, 76.92% precision rate and 74.59% F1 measure on NSTPA-681. The results of our GenericSegVal approach are much higher than that of the
bidirectional LSTM approach. Metrics on other datasets are also satisfying. It is important to note that
GenericSegVal is weak-supervised and we don’t need to manually label too many training samples.

Conclusions and Acknowledgement

This paper proposes a generic and weak-supervised framework named GenericSegVal to address the
problem of compound NER in hybrid academic domains. GenericSegVal consists of four components:
POS tagging, template extraction, text splitting and segment validating. We reduce the best split of
a text to the problem template extraction and maximizing the modularity, and design LDA Gibs sampling a dynamic programming algorithm to address the problems. Experimental results on classifying
compound entities show that GenericSegVal surpasses bidirectional LSTM approach. This work was
supported by in part by the National Key Research and Development Program of China under Grant
No.2016YFB0801003 and National Science Foundation of China under Grant No.61602342.
