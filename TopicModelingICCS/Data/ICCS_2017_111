1 Introduction
Hybrid directional couplers are prominent microwave components, finding diverse applications in
balanced-type circuits such as power amplifiers (Malo-Gomez et al., 2009; Wincza and Gruszczynski,
2011), mixers (Lin et al., 2008; Shahroury and Wu, 2008) or antenna feeding systems (Wincza and
Gruszczynski, 2016; Lin et al., 2013) to name just a few. The most representative examples of hybrid
(that is offering an equal power division between the output ports) couplers include branch-line
couplers (Mongia, Bahl and Bhartia, 1999) and rat-race couplers (Xu, Wang and Lu, 2011). For circuit
implementation realized in planar technologies, the branch-line couplers are typically chosen over the
rat-race couplers as the output arms of the latter devices are separated by an isolated port (Muraguchi,
Yukitake and Naito, 1983). The drawbacks include an increased design complexity as well as an
elevated estate area consumption, both resulting from the necessity of using crossovers (normally
realized as hybrid couplers in a back-to-back configuration) to comply with requirements of planar
technologies (Wong and Cheng, 2011). The classic textbook design formulas for the branch-line
couplers provide a perfect matching and isolation of the circuit as well as an even power split with a
90-degree phase difference between the outputs (Pozar, 1998). However, this ideal circuit operation is
only attainable at a single frequency (typically the center of the functional bandwidth) and deteriorates
with the departure from the operating point. In a basic one-section circuit configuration, branch-line
couplers offer an acceptable performance over an inherently narrow band of about 10% (Mongia, Bahl
and Bhartia, 1999). The latter is due to the modular architecture of the discussed type of directional
couplers, which is primarily based on quarter-wavelength transmission lines. Another downside of
such a circuit topology is a large footprint area, which becomes a particular issue for space-limited
applications of the lower microwave spectrum. The aforementioned problems have encouraged
continued efforts to obtain compact branch-line coupler design solutions with a wideband operation
(Chun and Hong, 2006; Yao, 2010; Lee and Lee, 2012; Ariolla, Lee and Kim, 2011). Size reduction of
the structure under development is typically accomplished by replacing conventional lines of the
original device with slow-wave lines with intricate geometries (Lee and Lee, 2012). Unfortunately,
this raises issues related to the selection (or development) of proper simulation models for accurate
(yet feasible) circuit performance evaluation. On one hand, electromagnetic (EM) computational
models are reliable, but expensive. On the other hand, equivalent circuits are merely capable of
delivering a rough approximation of a design solution. The given design problem becomes even more
challenging when considered from the wideband application standpoint. In general, broadband
transmission characteristics are available using multi-element slow-wave structures so that the
corresponding design task in not only associated with adjustment of (continuous) geometry
parameters, but—most importantly—with determination of the (discreet) number of duplicated slowwave unit elements. The very problem has been previously approached by using surrogate-based
optimization with kriging interpolation models (Kurgan, Koziel and Bandler, 2016). The development
of multi-dimensional data-driven models—fairly accurate over a wide-ranged parameter space—is a
challenging task itself and typically requires an additional fine-tuning, which adds notably to the total
computational design cost.
This work presents the effectiveness of applying the co-simulation models—combining the
accuracy of EM analysis and cost-efficiency of circuit simulation—in the process of expedited and
reliable design optimization of multi-element slow-wave structures to be used as the key building
blocks of compact wideband hybrid couplers. Our methodology, involving a trust-region gradient
search with Jacobian estimation embedded in a surrogate-based optimization scheme, is used here to
obtain nine design solutions at a moderate CPU cost. The final design with the smallest circuit area
requires no further fine-tuning.

2 The Design Problem: Variable-Topology Broadband Coupler
This work aims at addressing the design problem of broadband equal-split branch-line couplers
with compact footprints. The miniaturization concept applied here is based on the decomposition of a
reference structure (typically, an analytical or numerical design solution of an ideal circuit model) and
replacement of its building blocks with electrically equivalent, but shortened transmission lines
featuring a slow-wave effect (Kurgan, Filipcewicz and Kitlinski, 2012).
Here, the original circuit model is an ideal two-section branch-line coupler shown in Fig. 1. It
consists of low- (ZL) and high-impedance (ZH) quarter-wavelength transmission lines. As indicated by
the results reported in (Kurgan, Koziel and Bandler, 2016), the device under discussion offers an
infinite number of solutions that satisfy the following requirements for an ideal hybrid branch-line
coupler: (i) an even power division between the direct and coupled ports at the operating frequency f0,
(ii) matching and isolation better than –20 dB at f0, and (iii) a –90° phase difference between the
coupled and direct ports at f0. For the purpose of our further considerations, we hand-pick a specific
design solution for that structure using a design chart of (Kurgan, Koziel and Bandler, 2016), namely,
ZL = 34 Ω and ZH = 116.19 Ω.
The principal stage of the miniaturization procedure adopted here is finding suitable slow-wave
substitutes for the conventional transmission lines that constitute the original coupler. This way the
performance of the reference circuit can be maintained by satisfying design requirements imposed on
its building blocks. As thoroughly discussed in the literature (Kurgan, Filipcewicz and Kitlinski,
2012), designing of low-impedance slow-wave structures for wideband operation is particularly
difficult due to a large number of parameters describing their geometrically intricate layouts, the
necessity of using a multi-element topology instead of an inherently narrowband single-element one to
provide an enhanced bandwidth as well as a high computational cost of the corresponding EMsimulated models. To this end, we consider a cascade of a variable number of slow-wave unit elements
with additional feeding line sections placed at both ends (see Fig. 2). The proposed low-impedance
slow-wave line is sufficiently described by a vector of eight continuous geometry parameters xc = [l1 l2
l3 w1 w2 w3 w4 g]T and a discreet multiplication factor n. One should observe that the arrangement of
the low-impedance lines in the original circuit ensures that the dimensions of the target compact
coupler are dependent exclusively on xc, provided that the high-impedance lines are simply folded to
the interior of the structure.
The goal of the design procedure is to find values of xc and n that minimize the coupler area and
provide proper electrical parameters of its building blocks (in particular, an appropriate impedance and
electrical length).

3 Design Optimization Procedure
In this section we outline a procedure developed to handle the design optimization task discussed
in Section 2. The fundamental issue is low-cost optimization of cascaded slow-wave structures as
fundamental building blocks of the compact wideband couplers (cf. Section 2). It should be
emphasized that the procedure is focused both on explicit size reduction of the coupler footprint area
and, at the same time, on satisfying electrical performance parameters. At the level of the cascaded
slow-wave structure these are the characteristic impedance and its phase shift. The entire optimization
process is repeated for all considered multiplication factors (from 2 to 10) in order to identify the
overall best coupler topology.

3.1 Low-Fidelity Models for Cascade Optimization
One of our primary goals is to conduct the design optimization process in a computationally
feasible manner. To accomplish this, we utilize a surrogate-based optimization paradigm (Koziel and
Leifsson, 2016). The main challenge is the design of a cascade of slow-wave compact cells that
substitutes for low-impedance lines of the original wideband coupler. Here, we develop a cosimulation coarse model c of the discussed cascade as shown in Fig. 3. It is implemented in Keysight
ADS (ADS, 2011) and contains five duplicated cells, with feeding lines placed at each end. The cells
are represented as EM-simulated data components included in the co-simulation model of the cascade.
The benefit of using the co-simulation model is that its computational cost is the same as the cost
of evaluating a single cell, which is considerably lower than the cost of EM analysis of the entire
cascade. Clearly, due to the fact that cross-coupling effects between the cells are neglected in the cosimulation model, a correction is needed to improve its accuracy and use it in the design process.

3.2 Formulation of the Objective Function
There are three major objectives of the design procedure. These are as follows (here, xc denotes a
vector of geometry parameters of the slow-wave cascade, cf. Section 2):
1. Reduce the overall footprint area of the coupler A(xc);
2. Obtain a required phase shift of –90° between the input and the output of the cascade at the
operating frequency f0;
3. Maintain the maximum return loss level of –30 dB for the cascade, over the bandwidth of
interest.
The goal is to design area-efficient counterparts for the components of the original coupler circuit
of Fig. 1, fulfilling the above-listed requirements. Here, the focus is on design of the cascaded slowwave structure, due to its computational demands, however, the design optimization of the folded
high-impedance branch is accomplished in a similar manner (excluding the first objective). One

1487

should note that the high-impedance branch is geometrically simple so that the corresponding EM
model is sufficiently cheap to be used directly. All of these goals can be achieved by minimizing the
following objective function:
U ( x) 
A( x)  1[( P( xc )  90) / 90]2  2[max( S ( xc )  30,0) / 30]2

(1)

where P(xc) and S(xc) are the cascade phase shift (at f0) and its return loss (over a frequency band of
interest), respectively, evaluated from EM-simulated cascade model f. The first penalty term in (1)
enforces a required value of –90 for the transmission phase; the second term contributes to the main
objective in case the return loss requirement is violated; k, k = 1, 2, are penalty coefficients.

3.3 Optimization Algorithm
The coupler design problem is formulated as a nonlinear minimization task of the form

Here, we solve it iteratively using a trust-region (TR)-embedded (Conn et al., 2000) gradient search

The model Lc(i) is defined as

being linear expansions of P and S at xc(i). Here, the Jacobians Jc.P and Jc.S are estimated through finite

we choose relatively large values of hk such as 10–2), whereas hk = [0 … 0 hk 0 … 0]T with hk on the
kth position.
Note that although the low- and high-fidelity cascade models c and f are misaligned, they are
normally well correlated so that the Jacobian estimation using low-fidelity model can be considered as
reliable. It should also be noted that each iteration of (3) requires just one EM simulation of the
cascade.

impedance approaches ZL.

4 Results and Discussion
The design problem outlined in Section II is addressed here by following the proposed
methodology detailed in Section III. The development of a compact coupler with a wideband
operation and minimized layout area is divided into two parts. The primary task is to adjust the
designable parameters of the variable-topology low-impedance slow-wave structure of Fig. 2 so that
the coupler layout area is minimized with simultaneous ensuring of proper electrical parameters, that
is, the characteristic impedance ZL and –90° phase shift. These objectives are accomplished by
executing (3)–(6) for each considered n (here, n ranges from 2 to 10). The final compact coupler is
selected as the one with the smallest layout area among all obtained design solutions. The secondary
task is to adjust geometry parameters of the folded high-impedance branch by completing objectives
(2)–(3) from Section 3.2. This can be done directly using conventional optimization algorithms as the
corresponding EM problem is not computationally demanding.

For solving the design example described in this section, we choose the Taconic RF-35 dielectric
substrate with effective permittivity of 3.5 and substrate height of 0.762 mm. The operating frequency
for the original coupler circuit and its small-size versions is set to f0 = 1 GHz. In addition, we use
microstrip technology for all circuit implementations. For comparison purposes, a microstrip
realization of the original two-section branch-line coupler at f0 = 1 GHz occupies an excessive estate
area of 91.7 mm × 51.0 mm (4677 mm2).
All simulation models utilized within the proposed design method are implemented in CST EM
simulation environment (CST, 2013) with fine accuracy settings. The present design example as
described above requires the development of several EM models, in particular: a slow-wave unit
element model, slow-wave cascade models (for each considered n; nine models in total), and a
compact coupler model (for n that minimizes coupler layout area). An average simulation time of the
above listed models (calculated as the mean of all conducted simulations) is, approximately, 85, 770,
and 1750 (all in seconds), respectively. The lower and upper bounds l/u for the design space of xc,
together with the starting point xc(0) are collected in Table I.
We repeat the proposed design optimization procedure for all considered values of n. The obtained
numerical results are shown in Table II. Note that the scale of miniaturization included in the
comparison is calculated based on to the 4677-mm2 layout size of the original coupler microstrip
realization. The numerical cost of acquiring the results of Table II corresponds to 95 simulations of the
high-fidelity EM model of the compact coupler with three-element low-impedance cascades (note that
the smallest coupler layout area is reached with n = 3). A detailed breakdown of the design cost of
low-impedance slow-wave structure optimization is presented in Table III, where Nc and Nf stand for
the number of simulations pertaining to c and f models, respectively, while Rf represents the compact
coupler model for n = 3.

The secondary stage of the design procedure involves obtaining a folded high-impedance branch
that matches the low-impedance design solution with the smallest layout area (n = 3). Taking the case
of n = 3 independently, the entire design cost of obtaining the compact coupler corresponds to 11.18 Rf

evaluation). This result has been obtained efficiently when compared to a direct EM optimization of
the compact coupler with 12 designable parameters (8 for the low-impedance line and 4 for the highimpedance branch), whose estimated design cost is 150 Rf.
The frequency characteristics as well as the layout of the final compact coupler are depicted in Fig.

optimization methodology is very accurate, as no additional CPU-expensive design closure is
required. The final coupler shown in Fig. 4(b) occupies a small circuit area of 28.3% of the original
coupler microstrip realization. It also illustrates a high performance, that is, an even power split at the
operating frequency (|S21|, |S31| = –3.02 dB) and a –90.0° phase difference between the coupled and
direct output ports at f0. In addition, the couple offers a wide fractional bandwidth of 31.1%
(calculated for the return loss and isolation ≤–20 dB).

5 Conclusion
This work presents a reliable design methodology for broadband hybrid couplers whose topologies
are adjusted in the process of coupler layout minimization. The application of accurate, yet
computationally cheap co-simulation models and surrogate-based optimization enables keeps the
numerical expenditure at a low level. The final coupler offers a small size and a high performance,
without additional fine-tuning.
