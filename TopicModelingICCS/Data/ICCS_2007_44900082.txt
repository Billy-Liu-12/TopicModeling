Abstract. There are three types of urban size distribution: primate city
distribution, rank-size distribution and the medium distribution between
them. In order to avoid the defect of data, the paper uses both the
population and built-up district area data of above county level cities
in Guangdong Province in 2002 and 2004. The results prove that urban
size of the urban system in the province follows rank-size distribution. In
analyzing the value and the change of Zipf exponents, we point out the
characteristics of the size distribution of urban system in the province.
The paper also conducts spatial distribution analysis for urban system
in Guangdong Province. Power law distribution is also observed, and
value of the exponent belongs to the same range of value with those
in the size distribution analysis. The diﬀerences of focal point between
fractal dimension (the inverse of Zipf exponent) and power law exponent
(prevailing in complex network analysis) are ﬁnally discussed.
Keywords: Power law distribution, urban size distribution, urban
spatial distribution, complex networks.

Introduction

Guangdong Province is situated in the south of China P.R.C, adjacent to Hong
Kong and Macao, with a total area of 1,797.57 hectares. According to the National Census report of the year 2005, there are 91.85 million permanent residents
in Guangdong Province at 0:00, November 1st of the year 2005. Compared with
the 86.42 million of that in the year 2000 in the ﬁfth National Census, the population is increased by 5.43 million, amount for 6.28%, increasing 109 million per
year and the annual grow rate is 1.23%. Until the end of 2004, there are totally
21 prefecture-level cities, 23 county-level cities, 41 counties and 3 autonomous
counties in Guangdong Province.
Since 1995, Guangdong accelerated its steps in urbanization. At the end
of 2005, the urban population of Guangdong Province reached 55.73 million,
amount for 60.68% of the total population. However, there is great diﬀerence
among diﬀerent region in the province. The Pearl River Delta has high urbanization level with prominent urban cluster appearance, while for other regions

in the province, especially the northern mountain area, gaps are large compared
to the former. The new development of city systems in Guangdong needs to be
analyzed scientiﬁcally by using international common practice.

Urban Size Distribution Model and Spatial Distribution
Model

Zipf distribution. We know that the larger the city, the smaller the amount,
while small cities are huge in quantity. In 1949, G. K. Zipf [1] suggested the ranksize rule, which measures the city size distribution in a city system in terms of
the relationship between the size and the rank of the city, and argued the power
law distribution between the two variables
PR = P1 /R.

(1)

In formula (1),PR denotes the population of the city, P1 the population of the
largest city theoretically, and R the rank of city with PR . More generally, the
Zipf’s law can be denoted as
Pi = P1 · Ri−q ,

(2)

where Pi denotes the population of city i, P1 the population of the largest city,
Ri the rank of city i, and q is a constant.
Pareto distribution. If we use a population yardstick r to depict the size
of cities, and let P (r) denote the probability of S > r (i.e., a city having a
population above r), P (s) denote the probability of city size distribution, then
we get
∞

Pr ∝

P (s)ds.

(3)

r

If for any λ > 0, P (λr) ∝ λ−a P (r), where λ denotes the proportion of scale,
the scaling exponent, then we get the Pareto distribution of city size [2]
Pr ∝ r−a ,

(4)

where P (r) is the cumulative percentage of cities above threshold r.
If the total quantity of cities is N0 , let P (r) = N (r)/N0 , then (4) can be
rewritten as
(5)
Nr ∝ C · r−D ,
where N (r) is the cumulative quantity of cities, and C is a constant [2].
Compared with Hausdorﬀ dimension formula, we know D (equals α) is the
fractal dimension [3], [4]. Expression (5) is equivalent to the general form the
Zipf formula
(6)
P (K) = P1 K −q .
In formula (6), K denotes the rank of cities, q the Zipf exponent. Theoretically,
q = 1/α has the fractal dimensional properties, therefore it is called the Zipf
dimension.

Here r is an yardstick, N is the total amount of cities, dij represents the

If there is scale invariance in the spatial distribution of urban system, then
C(λr) ∝ λD C(r),
C(r) ∝ rD ,

where D is the fractal dimension of the urban spatial distribution.
Formula (9) suggests that in an urban system, the frequency for distance
between cities to be below r follows power law distribution. D represents the
extent of diﬀerences in the distance between cities, or the extent of balance in
the urban system spatial distribution.
Here follows the analysis of size distribution and spatial distribution of Guangdong urban system.

Size Distribution of Urban System in Guangdong
Province and the Search for the Exponent
Calculation Method and Data Source

Calculation method. There are two ways to measure the urban size. One
is to measure the size of urban population. In China, the urbanization level is
generally measured by the proportion of non-agricultural population in the total
population in the city, so the non-agricultural population is generally used to
measure the urban size. Another method is to use the built-up district area as
the measure.
The traditional rank-size distribution always uses the former method. Empirical studies show that research based on the more stable non-agricultural
population data can better reﬂect urban size and its growth speed. However, the
defects are also obvious. In the case of cities which have more ﬂoating population

The Study of Size Distribution and Spatial Distribution of Urban Systems

85

than that of the permanent residents, such method can hardly reﬂect actual situation. For example, the ﬂoating populations in Shenzhen and Dongguan take
large proportion of the total population. In statistical data from the sampled
National population survey of 2005, for Shenzhen in 2004, the non-agricultural
population is 1.6477 million, with registered population 1.6513 million, while
the actual population (including ﬂoating population) in the city reached 8.2775
million. Therefore, merely using non-agricultural population may have high inaccuracy. The built-up district area appears stable in the development of a city,
and it can better reﬂect the scale of the city since its statistics are less interfered
by other factors. For this reason, some foreign scholars used the built-up district
area in the rank-size analysis to study the development of urban cluster. When
applying the rank-size rule to analyze the development of built-up district in
Berlin, Schweitze etal pointed out that urban clusters are composed of many
built-up districts with diﬀerent area, and that the area and the rank of the city
follows rank-size rule [6].
Considering the applying contexts and advantage of both methods, based on
the current population situation in Guangdong Province, we use both methods
to analyze the urban size distribution in the province, and the results are then
compared.
Data source. The study focuses on the above county-level cities in Guangdong
Province in 2002 and 2004. Data are collected from the Guangdong Statistical
Yearbook. The population data concern the registered non-agriculture population. Because the built-up district areas of below prefecture-level cities are not
recorded, we only use the data of above prefecture-level cities in the analysis,
not including the counties and towns administrated by them.
3.2

Characteristics of the Distribution and the Exponents

According to the data collected, cities are ranked by their urban populations and
built-up district areas, respectively. The results are log-log plotted in Fig. 1 and 2.
From the ﬁgures, we see that all the distributions can be ﬁtted by a straight line.
Using formula
ln P (K) ∝ −q ln K,
(10)
we can get the Zipf dimension q, see Tab. 1.

From the analysis above, it is proved that the urban sizes of Guangdong
Province follow size-rank distribution in terms of both urban population and
built-up district area, and Zipf exponents are all below 1. From 2002 to 2004,
the population index increased, while the area index decreased.

Spatial Distribution of Urban System in Guangdong
Province and the Search for the Exponent

The spatial distribution of major cities takes the above prefecture-level cities in
Guangdong Province. In consideration of the particularity of the administrative

division in Foshan, two districts administrated by it (i.e., the Sanshui district
and the Shunde district) are treated as cites. Then there are totally 23 cities.
In studying the spatial distances between cities, the Googly-Earth Satellite
software is used to measure the accurate distances between city i and j, denoted
by dij , which are ﬁlled into a 23 × 23 symmetric matrix. By assigning r with
the multiple of 30 (i. e., r = 30, 60, 90, · · · , 720 kilometers), we may obtain a
series of corresponding C(r) following formula 8, as listed in Tab. 2. The data
are plotted and ﬁtted on a log-log scale (see Fig. 3).

The Implication for the Power Law Distribution of
Guangdong Urban Systems

According to existing research, all the early observed urban rank-size distributions have q = 1, and urban size distributions in many developed countries
have dimensions approaching 1. While for developing countries, the dimensions
are far from 1. That’s why the science of urban planning takes 1 as the natural or

88

J. Yang, D. Zhuang, and M. Kuang

ideal Zipf exponent. Therefore, whether q equals 1 should be used to assess the
rank-size distribution.
From Tab. 1, we obtained the q, R and D values for the size distribution of
urban system in Guangdong Province. In terms of the science of urban planning,
the distribution of population is more ideal than that of the built-up district area.
The urban population distribution is getting more reasonable, while that of the
built-up district area has an opposite tendency.
In terms of the complex network studies in recent years[7], cumulative power
law exponent between 1 and 2 results in the coexistence of small amount of largesized nodes and large quantities of small-sized nodes. When the value is below 1,
there are quite a few large-sized nodes. In the case of study for Guangdong urban
systems, the distribution follows the former. That is, a few large cities coexist
with a large amount of small cities.
The fractal dimension of Guangdong urban system spatial distribution D is
1.07, even smaller than that of the population. It suggest that the variance of
urban spatial distribution is greater than those of the size distributions measured
by population and built-up district area.
From 2002 to 2004, the power law exponent of population distribution is
increasing with that of the built-up district area distribution decreasing, suggesting the trend for the variance of population size to decrease and that of the
built-up district area size to increase. The distribution exponent of population
to approach 1 suggests the evolution trends for the population size distribution
to getting closer to those in the developed countries and regions.

Conclusion and Discussion

To summarize, both the urban size and the spatial in Guangdong Province follow
power law distribution, with the accumulative power law exponent between 1
and 2. It suggests the self-organized critical state [8] of urban distribution in the
Guangdong urban systems, with prominent fractal characteristics, and with the
coexistence of a handful of large cities with large amount of small cities.
Because ﬂoating populations are not included in the study (without access to
obtain the data), there must be errors in the conclusion. Therefore, size distribution considering built-up district area should also be combined in the analysis.
We previously pointed out that the Zipf exponent q is the inverse of Pareto
exponent (i.e. D), and Pareto distribution has the same implications with cumulative degree distribution in complex network. In complex network studies,
networks with cumulative distribution exponents between 1 and 2 are concerned
most, because their robust yet fragile feature can be signiﬁcant in practice. However, in the science of urban planning, whether the Pareto exponent (i.e. D)
equals 1 is concerned most(compared with urban systems having D between
1 and 2, they have more large size cities). The practical signiﬁcance and theoretical context of this diﬀerence, and why urban systems with D = 1 are the most
reasonable need more further research to be done.
