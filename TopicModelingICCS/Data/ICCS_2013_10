Abstract
The generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM) and twin support vector machine (TWSVM) was
proposed by Mangasarian and Jayadeva respectively, which aroused the interest of academia for its less computation cost and
better generalization ability. They use the nonparallel hyperplane classiﬁers to solve the classiﬁcation problem. Diﬀerent
from traditionally local or global TWSVM methods, a new Twin SVM algorithm called Local and Global Regularized Twin
SVM (TWSVMLG) is proposed in this paper. A global regularizer was imposed across local models to smooth the data
labels predicted by those local classiﬁers and avoid overﬁtting risk for the local classiﬁers. The classiﬁer could get stronger
discriminating ability when exploring local and global information than traditional algorithms. Finally some experimental
results are presented to show the eﬀectiveness of our algorithm.
Keywords: Twin SVM; Local regularization; Global regularization; Classiﬁcation.

1. Introduction
Standard support vector machines (SVMs) was ﬁrst introduced by Vapnik in 1990’s [1, 2, 3] , which are
based on the structural risk minimization (SRM) principle of maximum margin, dual theory, and kernel trick
originated from statistical learning theory. SVMs has achieved excellent generalization performance for pattern
classiﬁcation and regression problems ect [4, 5]. In the past few years some nonparallel hyperplane classiﬁers
such as the generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM) and twin support vector machine
(TWSVM), were proposed by Mangasarian [6, 7] and Jayadeva [8] respectively, which weren’t based on the
maximum margin principle. Unlike SVM, they are to ﬁnd the optimal separating hyperplane between the positive
and negative examples, TWSVM seeks two nonparallel proximal hyperplanes such that each hyperplane is closest
to one of two classes and as far as possible from the other class. TWSVM solves two smaller QPPs while SVC
solves one larger QPP, which has a faster training speed than SVC.
Many TWSVM algorithms have been greatly improved till now, such as least squares twin support vector
machines (LSTSVM) [9]. For linear kernel or nonlinear kernel, the solutions of LSTSVM could both reduce two
sets of linear equations instead of solving two quadratic programming problems along with two sets of linear
equations in TWSVM. Reduced kernel techniques was used so that LSTSVM could classify large datasets with

faster training time than TWSVM. Other developed methods like Twin bounded support vector machines (TBSVM) [10], which makes some improvements on TWSVM and proposes a modiﬁed version that the structural
risk minimization principle is implemented by introducing the regularization term.
All the methods above were global learning machines, which train the classiﬁer using the whole dataset as the
training set and ignore the correlation between pairs of points, resulting in need of improvement of generalization. Meanwhile, many classiﬁer has been introduced based on local regularization in recent years, such as [11],
[12],[13] ect. The local assumption that the half of the data information lurks in the nearest local neighbors that
can be found by k-nearest neighbor relations lurking in points has been proved by by theoretical study [17]. Kinds of experimental study were also certiﬁed that the local classiﬁer could have better classiﬁcation accuracy and
generalization than the global classiﬁer [18],[19],[20]. The local learning algorithm was also applied in TWSVM,
like localized GEPSVM (LIPSVM) [21] and localized TWSVM (LCTWSVM) [13], which was based on the same
local assumption.
The local learning algorithms concerning above aim to train the classiﬁer system by using only useful local
information of the dataset. However, despite great empirical and experimental results due to its powerful discriminating ability on local regions, only exploiting the local information of the dataset is not good enough because
that a local classiﬁer is usually small and the local classiﬁers ignore to consider the local correlation among other
local regions. Furthermore, another problem for the local classiﬁer is lack of robustness due to the overﬁtting
phenomenon in it. This motivates rush toward new classiﬁers to overcome the above two problems. In this paper,
we propose a new Twin SVM algorithm based on local and global regularization (TWSVMLG), which combined
the results of all these local classiﬁers with a global smoothness regularizer. The idea of incorporating both local
and global information into label prediction is inspired by the recent works on semi-supervised learning [14], [15],
clustering [16], classiﬁcation[20].
In our proposed algorithm, we ﬁrst divide the whole space into a set of local regions on each of which a
local classiﬁer is learned using its neighborhood. Then a global regularizer across local regions is imposed to
smooth the data labels predicted by those local classiﬁers. The overall classiﬁer combining the local and global
regularization will show comparable classiﬁcation performances with other Twin SVM algorithms. The essence
of our idea as a framework can also be extended to other learning problems, such as regression problem ect.
In the next section, we review the related work including TWSVM, TBSVM, Localized Twin SVM ect.
TWSVMLG will be discussed in Section 3. Section 4 deals with experimental results and Section 5 contains
conclusions.

2.1. TWSVM
The TWSVM algorithm ﬁnds two nonparallel hyperplanes to slove classiﬁcation problem, instead of a single
hyperplane as in the case of conventional SVMs [8]. The essence of TWSVM is that two nonparallel planes are
constructed, one is positive hyperplane and the other is negative, so that the point of +1 class is as close to the
positive hyperplane as possible meanwhile the point of −1 class is as close to the negative hyperplane as possible.
The two nonparallel hyperplanes are obtained by solving two QPPs of smaller size compared to a single large QPP
solved by conventional SVMs. For linear classiﬁcation problem, the optimization formulation of TWSVM can be
written as follows:

where ci , i = 1, 2 are the penalty parameters, ξ− = (ξ p+1 , · · · , ξ p+q )T , ξ+ = (ξ1 , · · · , ξq )T are error variables.The
nonparallel proximal hyperplanes are obtained by solving two other primal problems for nonlinear classiﬁcation
problem.
2.2. TBSVM
In order to solve the problem of TWSVM that only the empirical risk is considered, an improvement has been
proposed in [10] that the structural risk minimization principle is implemented by adding the regularization term
with the idea of maximizing some margin, which will be considered in this paper.

2.3. Localized Twin SVM
The algorithm combines locality and searches for two nonparallel hyperplane. For a given test point x0 , its knearest neighbors among the training set were retrieving, and then two optimal separating nonparallel hyperplanes
only over this k-neighbourhood were constructed. The optimization problem of k-neighbourhood of the test point
x0 could be described as following:

In this way, xrx (i) is the point of the whole training set in the nearest j-th position in terms of distance from x0
and the thus j < l ⇒ ||Φ(xrx0 ( j) ) − Φ(x0 )|| ≤ ||Φ(xrx0 (l) ) − Φ(x0 )||, while xrx0 (i)+ means the point in the nearest i-th
position of subset of the whole training set which all are class +1. For k = n, Localized Twin SVM becomes the
conventional Twin SVM. Certainly, We can easily promote the algorithm to the nonlinear classiﬁers.
3. TWSVMLG
In this section we introduce our new Twin SVM algorithm based on local and global regularization (TWSVMLG) to to overcome the drawback of the Localized Twin SVM classiﬁer. First we divide the entire region into L
local regions. Suppose that there are Nk+ points in class +1 and Nk− points in class −1 for the k-th local region.
In general, there should be two hyperplanes (w+k · x) + b+k = 0 and (w−k · x) + b−k = 0 for each local region. We
assume that there are two global hyperplanes (w+ · x) + b+ = 0 and (w− · x) + b− = 0 on the whole space which are
regularized as well as best approximates the local hyperplanes on each local region. For simplicity,, we suppose
w+
w+
x
that (w+ )∗ = + ,(w+k )∗ = +k ,x∗ =
, (w+ )∗ , (w+k )∗ , x∗ ∈ R(n+1)×1 .

b
bk
So (w+k · x) = 0, (w−k · x) = 0 as the locally hyperplane for the k-th local region and (w+ · x) = 0, (w− · x) = 0 as
the globally hyperplane for the whole region. We introduce the following regularization term Ω(w+ , w+l ) on each
local region as a criterion to depict the diﬀerences between them:

Ω(w+ , w+l ) =

where S l = N1l Nj=1
x jl (x jl )T , similarly can be obtained, Ω(w− , w−l ) = N1l (w− − w−l )T S l (w− − w−l ). With the above
regularizer on each region, then we can get the following two optimization problems:

where Ci > 0, i = 1...4 are the balance parameters.Since the correlation matrix S l is positive semi-deﬁnite matrix
so that it can be can be factorized into S l = QTl Ql where Ql ∈ Rd ×(n+1) with d = Rank(S l ). The dimensionality
of this subspace is Rank(Ql ) = Rank(S l ) which does not necessarily agree with that of its ambient space Rn+1 but
can be much smaller than d.
The derivation of the dual problem for (7) is given as follows. Let v+l = Ql (w+l − w+ ), we have
w+l S l x = w+l QTl Ql x = (v+l + Ql w+ )T Ql x = v+l Ql x + w+l S l x

We could extend the linear formulation into kernelized nonlinear version by introducing a mapping Φ from
the input space Rn+1 to another space with the inner product (Φ(x) · Φ(y)) = κ(x, y) as kernel function. So we
deﬁne Xl = √1c [Φ(x1l ), ..., Φ(xNl l )] is the matrix with each mapped sample in the l-th local region as its column
1
vector, and we have S l = XlT Xl . Therefore it is easy to get the dual problem of (7) for nonlinear version can be

4. Numerical Experiments
In order to verify the availability of our method TWSVMLG, we compare it with other conventional SVMs.
All algorithms are implemented in MATLAB (R2009b) and carried out experiments on a PC with Intel(R) Core
(TM) i5-2400 CPU @ 3.1GHz 3.09GHz 3.23GB Memory.
We conducted experiments on several publicly available benchmark datasets [23]. For all the methods, the
2
RBF kernel K(x, x ) = exp( − x−x
) is applied, the optimal parameters di , i = 1, 2 in TWSVM, ci = 1, ..., 4
σ
in TBSVM,ci = 1, ..., 4 in TWSVMLG along with σ are tuned for best classiﬁcation accuracy in the range
2−8 , 2−7 , ..., 28 , the optimal parameter L in TWSVMLG is obtained in the range [10, 100] with the step 10. The
model selection is performed by 5-fold cross-validation in terms of accuracy.
Table 1 shows the linear kernel comparison of TWSVMLG versus C-SVC, TWSVM, TBSVM. This result
shows that our new method TWSVMLG has comparable accuracy with LCTSVM , and higher accuracy rate than
conventional SVM, TWSVM and TBSVM in most datasets. However, the training speed of LCTSVM is very low
for the reason that decision functions need to be rebuilding for each new test point. So this algorithm’s practicality
is poor in spite of its great performance.

As previously mentioned,the inner products appear so that the kernel trick can be applied directly in our algorithm, we can easily solve the nonlinear cases rather than rebuild new algorithm in TWSVM, TBSVM,LCTSVM.
Table 2 shows the comparison of classiﬁcation accuracy for the nonlinear cases of ﬁve algorithms on ﬁve UCI datasets. Table 2 discloses that the accuracies of nonlinear TWSVMLG are comparable results with other
algorithms.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, we presented a new algorithm called Local and Global Regularized Twin SVM (TWSVMLG).
We ﬁrst pre-construct a number of local models of the training set and build the decision functions in each local
model with a global regularization. Our classiﬁer not only exploits the local information of the dataset but also
consider the local correlation among each local region. Furthermore, the global regularizer was imposed across
local models to smooth the data labels predicted by those local classiﬁers and avoid overﬁtting risk for the local
classiﬁers. From numerical experiments, we can notice that TWSVMLG has comparable or better performance
with other conventional SVM methods from the perspective of generalization ability. Our method can easily
extend this linear formulation into kernelized nonlinear version by introducing a mapping Φ from the input space
Rn+1 to another space . Further work may include how to extend local and global regularization to solve other
problems.
