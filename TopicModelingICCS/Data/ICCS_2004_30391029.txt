Abstract. In this paper a three-dimensional (3D) thermal simulations of basic
integrated circuit (IC) components are presented. The layout of the real Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) generated in CAD CADENCE software was loaded into the CFD-ACE environment, where 3D thermal simulations were done. The influence of many heating points was considered in
simulations. Comparison among several cooling conditions was also made and
presented in the paper. Also the importance of logic circuits thermal simulations
in case of their thermal parameters estimation, an approximation of potentially
thermally unstable areas, and a redesigning of a logic circuit due to its thermal
strength are shown in this paper.

1 Introduction
A constant development in microelectronics causes that new, till now not observed
problems have appeared during simulation process. One of the hot topics for IC designers is appropriate analysis of thermal phenomena, which appear in VLSI circuits.
Nowadays, more than half of IC fatal failures is caused by overheating a semiconductor structure or not efficient enough heat transfer in a device itself. This is only
one of many reasons why thermal analysis has become one of the most important research directions in modern microelectronics. A miniaturization and an increase of the
circuit integration degree influences strongly on an increase of the power density generated inside the IC and also on a deterioration of cooling conditions (Fig. 1).

All kinds of problems accompanying heat generation and abstraction became multiplied in multilayer integrated circuits. In such ICs, layouts must be designed much
more precisely than in a single layer IC. Although in this paper a single layer ASIC
components were tested, the presented thermal optimization path is valid for all ICs.

Thermal simulator is becoming an important CAD tool, which allows designer to
validate the structure, estimate the time life of the structure and also implement real
(changed by the increase of the temperature) electrical parameters. The complexity of
modern layouts makes impossible importing data for the thermal analysis manually,
so one of the most required elements of such simulator is layout converter, which task
is to extract from the 2D layout the 3D structure that is loaded into the simulator. The
conversion of this methodology is described in first part of this paper.
The differential equation of thermal conduction cannot be solved analytically for
such a complex structure as IC. Only numerical methods (e.g. finite differences or finite elements) can be used for solving this equation. Problems connected with proper
mesh generation are the most important issue, which has strong influence on accuracy, correctness and usefulness of thermal simulation results. On the one hand too
sparse mesh is the cause of incorrectness and possibility of an omission points of high
temperature, on the other, too dense mesh causes numerical problems (convergence
and accuracy problems), and also strongly extends simulation time. Due to complexity of the analyzed structures and also determinable compute power of a computer, the
simulation time cannot be too long, if a practical application of such simulation is
considered.
Another problem is an accurate boundary conditions definition, which is strongly
connected with IC cooling (most often convection is the most important phenomenon,
but sometimes also radiation must be considered), and also precise modeling heat
generation inside the structure. Simulator must be a specialized tool, which allows designer for generating the most optimal mesh, defining boundary conditions equal to
the real cooling conditions in the designed IC, and also proper definition of the heat
source. These problems are considered in second part of this paper.
Nowadays, nearly all IC are designed to decrease the usage of semiconductor area.
Such approach is the reason of designing projects in which heat sources are placed
very close to each other. These wrongly routed heat sources become the hottest areas
of a chip (so called hot spots), and are responsible for the thermal strength of the
whole circuits. The thermal simulation allows to estimate, where such spots are
placed in the logic circuit layout, and what is the temperature of these spots in a function of a power release. Redesigning of the layout by spreading hot spots effects in
larger, but far more thermally resistant circuit [5]. These problems are considered and
discussed in third part of the paper, on the example of a NAND gate and a operational
amplifier.

2 Exporting Layout to CFD-ACE
A layout generated in CADENCE environment is usually saved in CIF or GDSII format. Data written in GDSII file are used in a silicon foundry to prepare masks used in
production process. The format of data contains list of geometrical figures (most often
rectangles), their coordinations and layer type. Such GDSII file cannot be directly imported into CFD-Micromesh software, due to lack of information about typical thickness and placement of each layer [1,2,3]. These supplementary information must be
saved in technology file, which contains names of all layers used in the project (it

should be remembered, that GDSII file does not contain any information about passivation layers), and also conversion table allowing for ascription GDSII layer number
to CFD-Micromesh layer name. Exemplary conversion table used during simulation is
presented in Tab. 1.

3 Mesh Generation, Boundary Conditions, and Heat Generation
A proper mesh selection is a complicated process. There is an optimal number of
mesh nodes, which is a compromise among simulation time, convergence of solution
and also accuracy of results. The mesh generation is the important process during
model creation, although it is also the most time and effort consuming procedure[3,7].
Authors ran series of simulations for the same heating and cooling conditions, but
for models of different mesh densities. Also additional surfaces in Z-direction were
added. The total number of mesh nodes is presented in Tab. 2

The most crucial element of every thermal simulation is the proper selection of cooling conditions. Heat is being removed from the IC in three different ways:
- heat conduction in the semiconductor structure and packaging contact area
- heat conduction in metal wires connecting semiconductor structure and pins
- convection from upper IC surfaces
Complex IC thermal simulation should include heat distribution in both semiconductor structure and packaging, but due to time consumption of such estimation,
model dimensions and also mesh density of the structure, usually the whole simulation is reduced to semiconductor area.
If only a small part of the IC is considered, also side walls boundary conditions
should be set. The best solution in that case is to define adiabatic boundary conditions, which is similar to a situation, when simulated structure is surrounded by comparable structures of the same temperature. This is the worst condition case, so the
behavior of the logic gate in severe situation can be predicted.
Authors had chosen cooling conditions, that allowed for decreasing simulation
time, and also increasing the computations convergence, an isothermal or adiabatic
condition at the semiconductor structure – package contact, and convectional (linear)
at the passivation – air surface (Fig. 2).
An appropriate heat generation model is the most fundamental part of a properly
run thermal simulation. Unfortunately, it is impossible to build an electro-thermal
simulator for ICs. Although size and efficiency of heat sources inside the IC can be
estimated easily during designing process, it is impossible to define every heat source
separately; some global rules must be accepted. It is assumed that inside the IC, the
basic heat generation area is MOS transistor channel. In CFD-ACE environment, heat
source can be easily defined as a boundary condition for one of walls or interfaces of
the model. In that case every MOS channel in the IC layout can be easily defined as a
heat source. An interface between POLY1 and diffusion always matches transistor
area, so these interfaces can be automatically defined as heat sources. The drawback
of such solution is a uniform distribution of the heat in every MOS transistor. Although some transistors switch more frequently than others, every device is treated
uniformly, so every transistor is a source of the same power density.

The thermal analysis of basic IC elements demands high level of attention to detail
in modeling heat sources allocation. The most unsuitable method of simplifying the
model and increasing calculations is averaging generated power on larger area in order to attain omit some structure details (e.g. transistors’ channels). As an example, a

NAND gate was simulated with three different heat sources. In the first case the heat
source was defined properly – only in transistors’ channels, in the second case (shown
in Fig. 3) heat source was spread in whole diffusion area, in the third case the whole
gate surface was defined as a heat source.

Fig. 3. Diffusion areas defined as a heat source

Further averaging is the source of loosing information about the temperature distribution and also the computed maximum temperature is much reduced. It is impossible
to estimate the resistance of the circuit to the thermal breakdown.
In Tab. 3 comparison of results obtained during NAND gate simulations for three
different heat emission areas is presented. Enlarging the heat emission area (to decrease the complexity of the model) is the reason of decreasing the maximum temperature in the structure.

As it was mentioned in “Mesh Generation” section, three different mesh were used
during simulations (Tab. 4 and 5). In Fig. 4 (right) the exemplary mesh is presented.

During simulations two kinds of cooling conditions were considered (isothermal
condition for lower surface, and convection k = 40 Wm-2K-1 and Hs = 108 Wm-2 for
upper surface or adiabatic condition for lower surface, and convection k = 4000 Wm2 -1
K and Hs = 105 Wm-2 for upper surface. A graphical representations of simulations
results for the first cooling conditions are presented in Fig. 5.

Comparing results presented in Tab. 4 and 5, it can be found, that sparse mesh was a
source of serious numerical errors. When the density of the mesh achieved some crucial value, on the one hand simulations results became nearly unchangeable, but on
the other, if the mesh density was still being increased, simulation time was increasing
drastically. It was obvious, that implementing very dense meshes was unbeneficial.
The most optimal mesh for examined NAND gate model was a structure containing
19 surfaces and 200 cells for each surface.

The opamp device was simulated for the same cooling conditions as the NAND
gate. Simulation results are presented in the Fig. 6. In the successful simulation
opamp model consisted of 39392 nodes and 60717 cells.

5 Logic Gates Designing Due to Their Thermal Strength
As could be expected, transistors’ channels are the hottest areas on the surface of a
NAND gate. Due to the fact that NMOS channels are placed close to each other, this
area can be treated as the hot spot for this gate. In case of larger heat emission, and
bad cooling conditions, this spot is potentially thermally unstable and can be easily
overheated (although the temperature difference between NMOS and PMOS channels
is only 0.5K, more important than the temperature itself is the power density, that is
emitted from the NMOS area).
For some applications, in which the minimum chip area is not a crucial parameter,
it is much more profitable to redesign the basic logic gate to achieve more uniform
heating of all chip’s area. The comparison between maximum temperatures obtained
for standard and redesigned NAND gates simulations is presented in Table 6.

As can be seen, although the redesigned hate is slightly larger, the maximum temperature achieved in simulations is 0.5K less than in standard gate (Fig. 6). The temperature distribution on the surface of the redesign gate is presented in Fig. 9.
The very similar situation can be also found for the opamp structure. In the structure
optimized for minimal layout area, heat is generated unequally in the structure. All
transistors are grouped in one area and become the hot spot for this device (Fig. 7).
Redesigning the structure (e.g. placing transistors on both sides of the capacitor) will

1036

K. Slusarczyk, M. Kaminski, and A. Napieralski

make the structure a little bit larger, but the thermal strength of the structure will be
much more increased.
Logic gates that are thermally optimized should be used in all areas of the IC structure, which are potentially thermally unstable. Electrical simulations should be an integral part of a layout design, according to estimated power emission in different basic components, it is possible to select logic gates, which should be optimized also
thermally.

6 Conclusions
In this paper a full 3D thermal simulations of basic elements of the real ASIC IC were
presented. Such simulations allow for very detailed analysis of thermal phenomena
inside of the IC structure. The method for automatic transformation of the ASIC layout from the CADENCE environment into the CFD-ACE environment 3D model was
also presented in this paper. The obtained model was extremely accurate comparing to
the real silicon structure The implementation of the heat sources into the ASIC modeling quite simple and no advanced knowledge is necessary.
Although the heat generation model that was used during simulations was much
simplified (heat was generated evenly in the transistor channel), results obtained in
simulations can be used as a basis for redesigning the IC. It can be assumed, that such
full 3D thermal simulation can be necessary not only during designing process of the
simple ASICs (such as sigma-delta ADC), but far more complicated IC structures as
microprocessors or multilayer chips (where not only many heat sources, but also heat
transfer problems have to be taken into account) or even power devices.
Due to thermal simulations of basic layout components it is possible to optimize
thermally basic logic gates in order to decrease the maximum heat release in the ASIC
structure. Redesigned elements, which thermal strength properties are enlarged, can
be used in all potentially thermally unstable or insufficiently cooled devices.
