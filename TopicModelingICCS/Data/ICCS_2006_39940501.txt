Abstract. Operational risk is one of the most important risks for Chinese commercial banks, and brings huge losses to Chinese commercial banks recent
years. Using the public reported operational loss data from 1997 to 2005 of
Chinese commercial banks, we simulate the operational loss distribution, find
that loss frequency can be seen as Poisson distribution and the logarithm of loss
is normal distribution. In accordance with the confidence level required by
Basel II, aggregated loss distributions and operational Value-at-Risks (OpVaR)
are calculated by Monte Carlo Simulation. Comparing with the real loss, this
result is credible. We also calculate the economic capital by the VaR99.9 , and it
maybe help the banks to allocate appropriate their economic capital.

1 Introduction
Operational risk has gradually become an area of risk management in global banking.
The increase of sophisticated and complex banking practices have raised the needs for
an effective operational risk management and measurement system both to regulators
and financial industry. In the aspect of definition, the Risk Management Group
(RMG) of the Basel Committee and industry representatives have agreed on a standardized definition of operational risk[1], i.e. “the risk of loss results from inadequate
or failed internal processes, people and systems or from external events”. This definition, which includes legal risk and excludes strategic and reputation risk, relies on the
categorization of operational risks based on the underlying causes[2].
Operational risk is mainly triggered by human error, system malfunction, and
operational procedure mistake or control invalidation. It may result in huge loss of
financial institutes. There are some well-known cases such as the Barings’ bankruptcy in 1995, the $691 million trading loss at Allfirst Financial[3], LTCM,
Natwest, and Allied Irish Bank[4], and the $140 million loss at the Bank of New
York due to September 11th.

Due to the growth of e-commerce, large-scale mergers and acquisitions, the enrichment of financial service products, and the use of more highly automated technologies, the probability of operational risk is increasing [5].
There have been several operational losses recently in Chinese commercial banks,
such as the cheating case in Heilongjiang branch of Bank of China, the 4 billion loan
deceived in Kaiping, etc.. The Chinese financiers and researchers have paid high
attention to banks’ operational risks, but there have no effective measurements to
operational risk[6]. It is critical to improve the operational risk management of Chinese commercial banks.
Many of the operational risk models [7-8] such as Advanced Measurement Approaches (AMA), function correlation approach, causal models and Bayesian models,
actuarial models, etc., are restricted for applying to the Chinese commercial banks by
lacking of credible internal loss database. As the Monte Carlo simulation can overcome the deficiency of data by effective simulation and producing relative exact data,
we use Monte Carlo Simulation to get OpVaRs and economic capital estimates for
operational risk, this can help banks improve internal control and spur banks improving operational risk management.
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we discuss the simulation method
we used; section 3 describe the original data; section 4 presents the simulation results
and analysis, including the testing of the distribution of the historic operational loss
data, and calculation on the operational economic capital, and the result analysis; The
last past concludes the paper and introduces some future research directions.

2 The Simulation Method
Two parameters are commonly used to describe operational risk: the frequency and
the loss amount. If the loss frequency and the loss amount follow certain distributions,
and the statistical distribution of frequency and the loss are stable, we can use historic
loss data to estimate their distribution and operational loss.
We use Monte Carlo simulation compute the frequency and the loss distributions[9]. Different OpVaRs are then simulated. The steps of the method are described
as follows:
Step1. Collect historic loss data of operational events; estimate the loss frequency
and the loss, Normal distribution, uniform distribution, Poisson distribution
and exponential distribution are tested to find a most suitable distribution;
Step2. After generating the frequency distribution, we generate 1000 random numbers approximate to the distribution, representing the events for 1000 simulated periods.
Step3. For each period, generate required random number of loss (that is, if the
simulated events for period k is X, then simulate X losses) and add them to
get the aggregated loss for the period.
Step4. Run steps 1 to 3 ten times and take the average OpVaR as the final result.

3 The Data Set
We have collected operational losses of Chinese commercial banks from 1997 to
2005 by public report, such as the website of National Audit Office of the P.R.C.,
website of china banking regulatory commission, finance news of banks cases and

others, which counts 45 loss events, including 8 major commercial banks. Table 1 is
describing the number events of each year, and Fig.1 is the histogram of loss events.

4 Simulation Results and Analysis
4.1 Testing on the Loss Frequency Distribution and Loss Distribution
The loss varies significantly and most losses are under 5 million Yuan, so we test 11
curve regressions to simulate the loss distribution, and find that the logarithmic fits
the data best. The result of curve estimations is shown in table 2, Fig. 2 is the logarithmic value of Fig.1; the software we used is SPSS 11.5.

Based on table 1 and Fig. 2, we estimate the loss frequency distribution and loss
distribution, test the normal distribution, uniform distribution, Poisson distribution
and exponential distribution separately to find a most suitable distribution, and use the
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test to reject or accept the null hypothesis that the data
originate from the selected distribution with the estimated parameters. Table 3 shows
the result.

The results indicate that normal distribution and Poisson distribution fit the logarithmic of loss and loss frequency better than all other distributions. As shown in table
3, the loss frequency distribution is approximately 5 events per year. Considering the
historic logarithm of loss distribution, the skewness is -0.354, while the standard deviation of skewness is 0.354, then the data can be regarded as symmetry, the kurtosis
is -0.231, so we can conclude that the logarithm of single loss distribution follows
normal distribution.
4.2 The Losses Under Different Confidences
After we get the single loss distribution, we can calculate the OpVaRs under different
confidences, table 4 shows the result.

Then we can compute the aggregated loss in a one-year period, the steps are:
Step1: Generate the Poisson random variables n1 , n2 ,L , n1000 ;
Step2: If

ni = ki , then generate ki normal random variables, add them up and re-

sult is the loss this period;
Step3: Run steps 1 to 2 ten times and take the average as the value;
Step4: Using the 1000 potential loss to get the operational loss.
The aggregated loss is simulated, and we get some important statistical data, the
mean of the loss per year is 4659.799 million Yuan, while the standard deviation is
1246536.699.
As the new Basel Committee[10] required that the regulatory capital that covers the
operational risks over a one-year period within a confidence interval of 99.9%, we
compute the VaR99.9 , and other typical points of confidence level are shown as table 5:

4.3 Result Analysis
4.3.1 There is Huge Potential Operational Loss in Bank System
Most losses are not huge and there are 802 losses under 5 billion Yuan, there are 900
events below 10 billion Yuan, but there may be very huge loss a year and the biggest
loss we simulated is 176 billion, which can do harm to the survival of the banks.
4.3.2 The Loss Severity Affects the Aggregate Loss Distribution Much
Although the aggregate loss distribution is generated by the loss frequency and loss
severity, the influence of the two distributions on the aggregate loss distribution is not
equal, from table 4 and table 5 we can conclude that loss frequency distribution only
affect the aggregate loss distribution slightly, especially for the tail distribution, and
the higher frequency in one year, the less influence to aggregate loss; While the loss
severity affect the aggregate loss distribution much more, which makes the curve of
aggregate loss distribution is somewhat like the single loss distribution.
4.3.3 The Proposed Operational Economic Capital
Our purpose is not only to work out the aggregate loss distribution of operational loss,
but also use it to help determine the approximate operational economic capital of
Chinese commercial banks. Based on the results in 4.2, we can calculate the operational economic capital of Chinese commercial banks:
Economic capital = VaR99.9 -mean = 16707593-465979.9 =17141613.1 (Ten thousand)
So according to the new Basel committee’s suggestion, Chinese commercial banks as
a whole, should prepare 171.42 billion Yuan for operational loss.
4.3.4. The method and results are comparatively credible.
We present a simulation method and get some results to the operational risk, to verify
the result. The result is tested by two ways.
The first way is to use the aggregate loss distribution to map the 1000 periods to 9
periods and then comparing them with the real loss from 1997 to 2005. Table 5 shows
the detail.

The simulated result is almost the same with real time, for example, the simulate
result shows that there is only one year’s losses between 5 to 10 billion if the period is
9 years, and the real data is 1. This comparison study shows that the simulation results
are pretty good.
Second, since we simulated 1000 random data of loss frequency, according to the
theoretical result, there is about one number bigger VaR99.9 , or about 10 numbers
bigger than VaR99.9 , etc.. Table 6 shows the 4 group compared results.

Although there is no number bigger than the VaR99.9 , the biggest one in our simulation is 176.07135 billion, which is very close to the VaR99.9 (176.07593 billion).
The other three also accord with the theoretical result very well. It shows the simulation is reasonable.

5 Conclusions
Many operational models can’t be used to measure operational risk efficiently for
Chinese banks since Chinese commercial banks having little operational loss data and
it is critical to quantify the operational loss. In this paper, we present a simulation
method to the Chinese commercial banks as a whole, find that the logarithmic of loss
follows the normal distribution while the loss frequency follows the Poisson distributions. We calculate the OpVaRs, and compare them to the real loss data per year. The
results show that our method is comparatively reasonable and creditable, and the
supervision capital we calculated may help the regulators to determine the operational
economic capital.
Since the loss data is small, our simulation may be not exactly correct. If we have
more operational loss data, we will re-calculate the certain bank’s operational losses,
and test more models such as the Multiple-Criteria Programming [11,12], Support
Vector Machines[13] to find more suitable model. The model proposed in
this paper may be also used in general bioinformatics, any antibody and any antigen.
This is our further work.
