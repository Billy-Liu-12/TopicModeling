Abstract
Contemporary engineering design relies heavily on computer simulations. The structures and systems considered in many
engineering disciplines are far too complex to be described accurately using simple theoretical models; using simulations is often
the only way to adequately assess the performance of the design. Unfortunately, high-fidelity simulations are computationally
expensive so that their use in an automated design process based on conventional optimization algorithms is often prohibitive.
Despite the availability of faster computers and more efficient simulation software: growing demand for improved accuracy and
the need to evaluate larger and larger systems effectively diminishes the benefits of this increase in computing power. One of the
most promising ways of alleviating these problems are surrogate-based optimization (SBO) techniques which are capable of
reducing the number of expensive objective function evaluations in a simulation-driven design process. In SBO, the direct
optimization of the expensive model is replaced by iterative updating and re-optimization of its cheap surrogate model. Among
proven SBO techniques, the methods exploiting physics-based low-fidelity models are probably the most efficient. This is
because the knowledge about the system of interest embedded in the low-fidelity model allows constructing the surrogate model
that has good generalization capability at a cost of just a few evaluations of the original model. In this paper, we review one of
the most recent techniques of this kind, the so-called shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP). We discuss the formulation of
SPRP, its limitations and generalizations, and, most importantly, demonstrate its applications to solve design problems in various
engineering areas, including microwave engineering, antenna design, and aerodynamic shape optimization.
Keywords: Microwave engineering, aerodynamic optimization, surrogate modeling, space mapping, shape-preserving response prediction.

1. Introduction
The computer simulation is one of the most important tools in contemporary engineering and science. Starting from
small devices such as electronic devices and circuits, through complete systems such as aircraft, to large-scale
phenomena (e.g., climate models), simulation is used to evaluate the performance and validate the designs. Commercial
simulation packages have matured and the computing resources are cheaper and in abundance. Yet, in many cases,
accurate, high-fidelity simulation is computationally expensive, to the extent that its use in the design process, e.g., by
employing it in an automated design optimization loop, may be prohibitive. The primary reason is that conventional
optimization algorithms, both gradient-based [1] and derivative-free [2] require large number of objective function

evaluations. In some cases, the use of adjoint sensivity [3] can alleviate this difficulty; however, this technique is not
always available through commercial simulation packages. On the other hand, design automation becomes a necessity
in all situations where simple theoretical models are no longer capable to adequately account for complex interactions
between the system components and, therefore, yield nothing but an initial approximation of the optimum design that
has to be tuned further in order to meet the given performance requirements.
on parameter studies guided by engineering experience. This combination is often sufficient to obtain satisfactory
designs in reasonable time; however, it is far from being an automated process.
Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) [4], [5] is probably the most promising approach to alleviate the difficulties
discussed in the previous paragraph. In SBO, direct optimization of the expensive high-fidelity simulation model is
replaced by iterative updating and re-optimization of its computationally cheap representation, the surrogate. Because
of shifting the optimization burden into the surrogate, the overall design cost can be greatly reduced. The high-fidelity
model is referenced rarely, to verify the prediction produced by the surrogate and to improve the latter. Various SBO
methods differ mostly in the way the surrogate is created. There is a large group of function approximation modeling
techniques, where the surrogate is created by approximating sampled high-fidelity model data. The most popular
methods include polynomial approximation [5], radial basis function interpolation [6], kriging [7], support vector
regression [8], and neural networks [9]. Once created, approximation models are very fast, however, a large number of
training samples and a high CPU cost of gathering the simulation data are necessary to ensure reasonable accuracy.
Furthermore, the number of samples grows exponentially with the dimensionality of the design space (the curse of
dimensionality). Depending on the model purpose, this initial computational overhead may (e.g., multiple-use library
models) or may not (e.g., one-time optimization) be justified.
Another approach to surrogate-based optimization is by correcting an auxiliary low-fidelity (or coarse) model. Lowfidelity model is a reduced-accuracy but faster representation of the system of interest. This can be obtained in various
ways, such as by using simplified-physics, leaving out certain second-order effects, or describing the system on a
different physical level (e.g., equivalent circuit versus full-wave electromagnetic simulation in case of microwave
components). In many areas, engineers have been using such simplified models for decades: before the computer era
they were the only way to conduct the design process. Because of the fact that the low-fidelity model contains certain
knowledge about the system of interest, physics-based surrogates offer good generalization capability and can be set up
using a limited number of training points, which is their biggest advantage over purely approximation models. Several
techniques have been proposed to exploit physics-based surrogate models in the SBO process, including the
approximation model management optimization (AMMO) framework [10], space mapping (SM) [11], manifold
mapping [12], and simulation-based tuning [13]. Many of these methods are based on correcting the low-fidelity model
output (response). If the correction is realized to ensure both zero- and first-order consistency [10] between the
surrogate and the high-fidelity model, the SBO process is provably convergent to the high-fidelity model optimum [13]
when embedded in the trust-region framework [14]. In some cases (with a notable example of SM), the correction can
be done by introducing a shift or an even more complex mapping between the parameter space of the low- and highfidelity models.
One of the recent techniques exploiting physics-based low-fidelity models is the shape-preserving response
prediction (SPRP) technique [15]. This method, originally developed in microwave engineering area [15], has been
applied to problems in antenna design [16] and aerodynamic design [17]. SPRP is a parameter-less method where the
surrogate model response is constructed by tracking the changes of the low-fidelity model response when moving from
a certain reference design to another one, and applying these changes (represented by translation vectors) to a reference
response of the high-fidelity model. The SPRP surrogate exploits the knowledge embedded in the low-fidelity model to
a larger extent than, e.g., SM, and, therefore, its generalization capability is usually better than that of SM [15]. In this
paper, we review the SPRP technique, its basic and generalized formulations, and attempt to give an intuitive
explanation of its efficiency. We also illustrate its operation and performance using several design examples from
various engineering disciplines.

3. SPRP for Microwave Design Optimization
In this section, we demonstrate the use of SPRP for the design optimization of microwave components. Consider
the dual-band bandpass filter [21] (Fig. 3(a)). The design parameters are x = [L1 L2 S1 S2 S3 d g W]T mm. The fine

0.7 GHz, 1.1 GHz
1.6 GHz and 2.0 GHz
1.75 GHz
2.2 GHz. The coarse model is implemented in Agilent ADS [23] (Fig. 3(b)). The initial design is x(0) = [16.14
17.28 1.16 0.38 1.18 0.98 0.98 0.20] T mm (the optimal solution of c). The following characteristic points are
selected to set up functions F and R: four points for which |S21| = 20 dB, four points with |S21| = 5 dB, as well as 6
additional points located between 5 dB points. For the purpose of optimization, the coarse model was enhanced by
tuning the dielectric constants and the substrate heights of the microstrip models corresponding to the design variables
L1, L2, d and g (original values of r and H were 10.2 and 0.635 mm, respectively) [15]. The filter was optimized using
two versions of SPRP, a regular one and SPRP enhanced by input SM (cf. Table 1). Figure 4 shows the initial fine
model response as well as the fine model response at the design obtained using the shape-preserving response
prediction method.

4. SPRP for Antenna Design
In this section, we illustrate the use of SPRP for the design of antenna structures. As an example, consider an
antenna shown in Fig. 5 [24] where x = [l1 l2 l3 l4 w2 w3 d1 s]T are the design variables. Multilayer substrate is ls × ls
(ls=30 mm). The antenna stack (bottom-to-top) comprises: metal ground, 0.813 mm thick RO4003, microstrip trace (w1
= 1.1 mm), 1.905 mm thick RO3006 and a trace-to-patch via (r0 = 0.25 mm), driven patch, 3. 048 mm thick RO4003,
and four patches at the top. The antenna stack is fixed with four M1.6 bolts at the corners (u = 3 mm). Metallization is
Feeding is through an edge mount 50 ohm SMA connector with the 10 mm × 10 mm × 2 mm
flange.
The design objective is |S11| 10 dB for 3.1 GHz to 4.8 GHz. Realized gain not less than 5 dB for the zero zenith
angle is an optimization constrain over the frequency band. The initial design is xinit = [ 4 15 15 2 15 15 20 2]T mm.
Both the high-fidelity model f (2,334,312 mesh cells at the initial design, 160 minutes of the evaluation time) and
the low-fidelity model c (122,713 mesh cells, 3 min of the evaluation time) are simulated using the CST MWS
transient solver [25]. Here, the first step is to find the rough optimum of c, x(0) = [ 4.91 15.15 15.07 2.56 14.21
14.23 21.07 2.67]T mm. The computational cost of this step is 82 evaluations of c (which corresponds to about 1.5
evaluations of the high-fidelity model). Figure 6(a) shows the responses of f at xinit and x(0), as well as the response
11 dB for 3.1
of c at x(0). The final design x(4) = [ 5.21 15.38 15.57 2.58 14.41 13.73 21.07 2.067] T mm (|S11
GHz to 4.8 GHz, Fig. 6(b)) is obtained after four iterations of the SPRP-based optimization. The gain of the final
design is shown in Fig. 6(c) which illustrates that the maximum of radiation points along the zero zenith angle
closely over the bandwidth of interest. The total design cost corresponds to about 10 evaluations of the high-fidelity
model (Table 2).

5. SPRP for Aerodynamic Shape Optimization
The SPRP technique is illustrated here on the aerodynamic design optimization of airfoil sections at transonic
flow conditions [17]. Consider the NACA four-digit airfoil with the shape defined by three parameters: m (the
maximum ordinate of the mean camberline as a fraction of chord), p (the chordwise position of the maximum
ordinate) and t/c (the thickness-to-chord ratio) [26]. The design variable vector is x = [m p t/c]T. Figure 7 shows
examples of three NACA four-digit airfoil shapes.
The computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models are implemented using the ICEM CFD [27] grid generator and the
FLUENT [28] flow solver. The high-fidelity model f is a two-dimensional steady-state Euler analysis with roughly
400,000 mesh cells and an overall simulation time around 67 minutes. The low-fidelity model c is the same as the highfidelity one, but with a coarser mesh (roughly 30,000 cells) and relaxed convergence criteria (100 flow solver
iterations). The ratio of simulation times of the high- and low-fidelity model is roughly 80.
In aerodynamic shape optimization, the SPRP technique is applied to the pressure distribution (Cp(x)) on the
airfoil surface [17]. Figure 8 shows the pressure distributions of two different designs obtained by the low-fidelity
model. Shown are the characteristic points (red circles) and the translation vectors (blue lines) at important areas of
the distributions. The application of the translation vectors to the high-fidelity model distributions is shown in Fig. 9.

The design objective is to maximize the section lift coefficient (Cl(x)) subject to constraints on the section drag
coefficient (Cdw(x)) and the non-dimensional cross-sectional area (A(x)). The problem is formulated as minimization
and g2(x) = Amin A(x
of the high-fidelity model f(x) = Cl(x) subject to g1(x) = Cdw(x) Cdw.max
Cdw.max = 0.0041 is the maximum drag and Amin = 0.065 the minimum cross-section. The free-stream Mach number is

Due to unavoidable misalignment between the pressure distributions of the high-fidelity model and its SPRP
surrogate, it is not convenient to handle the drag constraint directly, because the design that is feasible for the
surrogate model, may not be feasible for the high-fidelity model. This problem is alleviated by implementing the
drag constraint through a penalty function. More specifically, the objective function is defined as
H (C p ( x))

Cl.s (C p ( x))

Cdw.s (C p ( x)) 2 ,

(5)

where Cdw.s = 0 if Cdw.s Cdw.s.max and Cdw.s = Cdw.s Cdw.s.max otherwise. The cross-sectional area constraint is
handled directly. We use = 1000 in the numerical study. Here, the pressure distribution for the surrogate model is
Cp = Cp.s, and for the high-fidelity model Cp = Cp.f. Also, Cl.s and Cdw.s denote the lift and drag coefficients for the
surrogate.
The optimization problem is solved by the direct optimization of the high-fidelity model using the pattern-search
algorithm, as well as by the SPRP algorithm. The results are presented in Table 3. It can be seen that both
approaches are able to meet the design goals and produce similar optimized airfoil shapes. The direct approach
requires 120 high-fidelity model evaluations (Nf). The SPRP algorithm requires 330 low-fidelity model evaluations
(Nc) and 11 high-fidelity ones, yielding a total cost of less than 18 equivalent high-fidelity model evaluations.

To meet the design goals, the optimizer does three fundamental shape changes: (1) the maximum ordinate of the
mean camber line (m) is reduced, (2) the location of the maximum ordinate of the mean camber line (p) is moved
aft, thus increasing the trailing-edge camber, and (3) the thickness-to-chord ratio (t/c) is reduced. Shape changes (1)
and (3) reduce the shock strength and, thus, reduce the drag coefficient. The associated change in the pressure
distribution reduces the lift coefficient. However, shape change (2) improves (or recovers a part of) the lift by
opening up the pressure distribution behind the shock. These effects can be seen in the pressure distribution plot in
Fig. 10(a), and the Mach contour plots in Figs. 10(b) and (c).
6. Conclusion
A review of shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP) and its applications to solving simulation-driven design
problems in various engineering disciplined has been presented. SPRP exploits the knowledge embedded in the lowfidelity model of the structure under consideration in order to predict the response of the expensive high-fidelity
model. As a result, SPRP is capable of yielding a satisfactory design at a low computational cost as demonstrated
using several examples involving design problems in electrical and mechanical engineering.
