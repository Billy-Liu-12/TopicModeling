Abstract. Semi-Lagrangian two-time-level finite difference scheme for
hydrostatic atmospheric model is considered. Approximation of the
gravitational waves in implicit-explicit manner allows to keep balance between
extended stability and required accuracy. Both are assured by implicit
discretization of the fast principal vertical modes and explicit approximation of
the slow secondary gravitational waves. Numerical experiments with actual
atmospheric data are carried out to define the most efficient implicit-explicit
separation, which produces the accurate forecasts at the less computational cost.

1 Introduction
Semi-Lagrangian (SL) approach has been proved to be an efficient alternative to
Eulerian one because it allows to circumvent the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL)
criterion related to advection velocity, requiring only solution of trajectory equations,
which represent the systems of ODE decoupled at each grid point and solved
efficiently by iterative algorithm [7,15]. If, additionally, gravitational terms of
hydrostatic atmospheric model are discretized with sufficient degree of implicitness,
then time step of SL schemes can be chosen on the base of accuracy considerations
[7,15]. This is great advantage of such schemes because more straight explicit and
implicit discretizations are computationally expensive: explicit approximation
requires very small time steps due to fast gravitational waves and implicit
approximation requires solution of nonlinear PDEs at each time step.
The choice of the level of implicitness of gravitational terms in SL schemes can be
based on considerations of efficiency, including the accuracy of forecasting fields and
minimization of computational cost. The most direct approximation is implicit, which
is used in the majority of the SL schemes [7,15]. It allows to use a great time steps,
but it is not the most efficient way because the 3D linear algebraic systems of the high
order M × N × L (where M, N and L are the number of points in horizontal and
vertical directions) should be solved at each time step. There is a chance to avoid
these hard computations by separating the spectrum of gravitational waves. It is well
known that highest internal barotropic modes of the vertically decoupled hydrostatic
equations contain the gravitational waves with the smallest amplitudes and slowest
velocities of propagation [8]. Such waves are secondary and do not impose any
relevant restriction on time step and, consequently, they can be discretized in explicit

manner on a coarse grid. This way, implicit part can be reduced to K separate 2D
linear systems of the order M × N , where K is a small as compared to L. Thus, the
computational cost can be reduced if the slow gravitational waves are discretized
more explicitly and coarsely.
A similar approach has been used in a three-time-level SL model [3]. The reported
results showed strong points of developed scheme for time steps up to 40 min. In the
last decade, motivated by results of McDonald [10] and Temperton and Staniforth
[16] for shallow water equations, numerical modelers started to substitute tree-timelevel SL schemes by two-time-level ones, which allow to achieve the same accuracy
with even larger time steps [9,11,17]. In this paper we apply the modified technique
of [3] to two-time-level scheme with objective to increase time step up to 60 min with
no loss of forecast accuracy.

2 Semi-Lagrangian Implicit-Explicit Time Discretization
Primitive equations in time coordinate t , horizontal Cartesian coordinates x, y and
vertical coordinate σ = p p s can be written as follows [7]:

d t u = f 0v − Gx + N u , d t v = − f 0u − G y + N v ,

(1)

Gln σ = − RT , d t P = − D − σ! σ , c p d t T = RT0 ⋅ (d t P + σ! σ ) + c p N T ;

(2)

N u = ( f − f 0 )v − R (T − T0 )Px , N v = −( f − f 0 )u − R(T − T0 )Py ,

(3)

c p N T = − R(T − T0 )(σ! σ − D − σ! σ ) .

(4)

Here, u , v and σ! are horizontal and vertical velocity components, D = u x + v y is
the horizontal divergence, P = ln p s , p and p s are the pressure and surface pressure
respectively, T is the temperature, G = gz + RT0 P , z is the height. Nonlinear and
variable coefficient terms are grouped in N u , N v , N T . Individual 3D derivative is

d t ϕ = ϕ t + uϕ x + vϕ y + σ!ϕ σ

, ϕ = u , v, P, T

and the following parameters are used: f is the Coriolis parameter with the mean
value f 0 , g is the gravitational acceleration, R is the gas constant of dry air, c p is
the specific heat at constant pressure, T0 = const is the reference temperature profile.
Hereinafter the subscripts t , x, y, σ denote the partial derivatives with respect to
indicated variable.
Let us split solution of (1)-(2) into two steps. The first SL step consists of solution
of the advective part of the prognostic equations
d t r = V , r = (x, y, σ ) , V = (u, v, σ! ) .
These equations are efficiently solved by Robert's iterative algorithm [14,15], which
assures the second order of accuracy and converges under limitation on time step
expressed in the terms of the wind derivatives [13,15]:

),

For fine grid with horizontal meshsize about 50km and 20 vertical levels it gives
maximum time step about 1 hour.
The other terms, including gravitational waves, are considered on the second step
u t = f 0 v − G x + N u , vt = − f 0 u − G y + N v ,

(5)

Pt = − D − σ! σ , c p Tt = RT0 ⋅ (Pt + σ! σ ) + N T .

(6)

Implicit discretization of all the gravitational terms ( G x , G y , D , σ! σ , σ! σ ) is the
most traditional approximation in SL models [7,15,17]. It gives rise to the following
time difference equations:

where τ is the time step, superscript n + 1 denotes the values at the new time level

The nonlinear terms are evaluated by extrapolation to the half way time level t n +1 2 :

N n +1 2 = 3N n − N n −1 2 , N = N u , N v , N T .
The scheme (7)-(9) is of the second order of accuracy and linear analysis shows that it
is absolutely stable. However, it requires the solution of 3D elliptic problem at each
time step [11,17].
Another way of approximation of gravitational terms is explicit. For example,
forward-backward time differencing gives:
uˆ n +1 − u n

waves and c grav ≈ 350 m s is the propagation velocity of the fastest gravitational

waves. This condition implies the use of the small time steps about 3 min on a fine
horizontal grid with h g = 50km . However, the algorithm of solution at each time step
is very simple because this scheme is actually explicit.
Finally, let us consider implicit time differencing for essential fast gravitational
waves and explicit one for secondary slow waves. To this end, we should apply
vertical transform to separate the different types of the gravitational waves. First we
eliminate functions P, T and σ! from (6) to obtain prognostic equation for G :
c p (σG t ln σ

)σ

= R 2 T0 D − c p R(σN T )σ .

(13)

Then, we use the vertical expansion of the functions

where S k (σ ) are the first K eigenfunctions of the differential vertical structure
equation
c p (σS ln σ )σ = −λ −1 RS
or its discrete analogues, that is, the eigenvectors of the difference vertical structure
equation on vertical K-level grid. Using (14) we can rewrite equations (5), (13) in the
following form for each vertical mode k
u t k = f 0 v k − G x k + N u k , vt k = − f0uk − Gy k + Nv k , G t k = − c k2 D k + N G k ,

where c k = RT0 λ k and N G = λ k R((σN T )σ

(15)

)k . It was shown in [5] for differential

vertical structure equation and in [4] for difference equation that all eigenvalues λ k
are positive and have zero limit point as k approaches infinity. Fig.1 shows the values
of c k as function of the mode number k for 20-level Lorenz staggered vertical grid.
The results for homogeneous grid and actual grid (with concentration of the levels in
boundary layer and higher troposphere) are presented.
Now we can apply different approximation to the fast and slow gravitational
waves. The first I principal vertical modes are approximated implicitly with second
order of accuracy

(21)

Let us note that although systems (15) are coupled through nonlinear terms, both
schemes (16)-(18) and (19)-(21) can be solved separately for each k because nonlinear
terms are treated explicitly. This approach generates stability condition in the
form τ ≤ 2 h g c I +1 , where c I +1 is the maximum gravity-wave speed of the modes
treated explicitly.
If discrete vertical transform is applied, implicit approximation (16)-(18) of all the
vertical modes will result in the scheme (7)-(9) and explicit approximation (19)-(21)
of all the modes will give forward-backward scheme (10)-(12).

3 Numerical Experiments
In this section we present the results of the experiments with different configurations
of the vertical approximation. At each time step, the explicit approximation (19)-(21)
is solved by direct formulas: first G kn +1 are found from (21) and then u kn +1 and v kn +1

136

are elementary solved from (19) and (20). The implicit approximation (16)-(18) is
reduced to 2D Helmholtz equation for G kn +1 :

where ritght-hand side is combination of the values at the time level t n . This equation
is solved by multigrid method, which is fast solver for such kind of the problems. Its
optimal versions require O(MN ) arithmetic operations, where M and N are the
number of points in horizontal. We apply BOXMG algorithm [2,6] based on Galerkin
type of discretization, which allows to use spatial grids with arbitrary number of the
points with no less of the convergence speed of iterations. Numerical experiments
showed that optimal version of the BOXMG algorithm for equation (22) consists of
using the V-cyclic method with two cycles for the first two vertical modes and one
cycle for others. One four-color Gauss-Seidel point relaxation sweep is performed on
any grid both before dropping down to the next coarser grid and before interpolation
to the previous finer grid. As initial guess for iterations we use G kn . After G kn +1 is
found, the u kn +1 and v kn +1 are calculated by elementary solution of (16), (17).

Fig. 2. Time step and computational cost of the implicit-explicit schemes

24-hour integrations of the primitive equations were carried out for different
number of the vertical modes approximated implicitly. Fig. 2 shows time step used in
these experiments (chosen in accordance with stability criterions) and computational
time cost (in percent of the forecast time of the forward-backward scheme (10)-(12))

as functions of the number of the implicitly treated vertical modes. The required
computational time for one forecast computed by implicit approximation (7)-(9) is
also shown. The last integration is less expensive than that with implicit solution of all
vertical modes by formulas (16)-(18). The former requires solution of the 3D elliptic
equation but does not need application of vertical tranform, while the latter uses
vertical transform and fast MG solvers for a set of 2D elliptic problems. Although
multigrid solution of 3D equation is more expensive than fast solution of the
decoupled set of 2D equations, the additional computational charge due to vertical
transform is too hard. Since both schemes have absolutely stable adjustment step, that
is, their maximum time step is about 60 min as defined by advective step, the scheme
(7)-(9) required less computational time than (16)-(18) with I=K. Nevertheless, some
versions of the implicit-explicit algorithm are more computationally efficient than the
standard algorithm (7)-(9). For example, implicit treatment of 7-9 vertical modes
gives certainly more efficient algorithm.
To evaluate forecasting ability of the above schemes we carried out integrations
based on actual atmospheric data. The horizontal domain of 5000x5000 km 2 centered
at Porto Alegre city ( 30 0 S , 52 0 W ) was covered by uniform spatial grid C with
meshsize h = 50 km (we use Arakawa-Mesinger nomenclature of spatial grids [12]).
The initial and boundary conditions were obtained from objective analysis and global
forecasts of National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

It is well expected that after certain period of integration the forecast results will be
determined in high degree by boundary conditions. Therefore the standard evaluation
time for the regional models is limited to 24 or 36 hours of integration [1]. In Fig. 3

138

we present the root-mean-square differences in meters between 24-h forecasts and
analysis at pressure level 500hPa. This is standard measure of quality of short-range
weather forecasts for geopotential fields [1]. Each scheme was run with appropriate
time step chosen in accordance with stability criterions. Based on this results we can
conclude that the most efficient algorithms are obtained when implicit-explicit
algorithm with 7-9 implicit modes is used.
