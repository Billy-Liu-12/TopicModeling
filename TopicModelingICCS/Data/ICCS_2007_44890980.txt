Abstract. Energy consumption, economic development level, population
growth, and climate change and so on all have close relations with environment
pollution. Based on the statistical data of Anhui province in China from 1987 to
2004, this paper analyzes the direct and indirect influences of energy
consumption, total output value of industry, population, temperature and
precipitation on environment pollution. The results show production pattern of
industry and consumption of electric power are main reasons of environmental
pollution.
Keywords: Energy consumption, Environment pollution, Multi-path analysis
model, Anhui province.

1 Introduction
With society and economy developing, environment pollution becomes more and
more serious, and, in some degree, begins to threaten economic development, human
healthy and social security. Most of existing studies are about the influences of single
social or economic factor on environment, and emphasize on the relationship between
economic growth and environment pollution level, i.e. different expressive forms of
Environmental Kuznets Curve, rarely relating to multi-factor influences on
environment or direct and indirect influences on environment through effect factors.
Since there are various factors which affect environment, such as the increase of
energy consumption, the enhancement of industrialization, the growth of population,
and the change of climate and so on, environment is a systematic engineering.
Treating energy, economy, population, climate and environment as a whole, the
multi-path analysis model is used in this paper to make a case study of Anhui
province, China, analyzing direct and indirect influences of energy consumption, total
output value of industry, population, temperature and precipitation on environment
pollution as well as the interaction among each factor. The result of this paper can
provide scientific foundation for coordination between regional economy and
environment and policy-making of regional environment.

2 Methods
When there are many variables, one independent variable can act on dependent
variable not only through direct effect, but also through indirect effect by acting on
other dependent variables. Path analysis is combinational analysis of regression
equation which is the supplement and development of correlation analysis [1]. It can
reduce coefficients of simple correlation into many parts, and show both direct and
indirect influences of independents on dependent [2].
Based on data coming from “Anhui statistics yearbook”, “Anhui energy statistics
yearbook” of 1988-2005 and other references [3], this paper will use path analysis
model to analyze the direct and indirect influences on environment pollution in Anhui
province from 1987 to 2004. Detailed processes and formulas which can be consulted
in reference [4] are omitted.
In our calculation, dependent variables including total waste water discharge,
industrial solid waste discharge and total waste gas discharge are used to show
environment pollution situation. The following 7 indexes are used as independent
variables which affected environment: quantity of population(X1), consumption of
electric power(X2), consumption of petroleum(X3), consumption of coal(X4), total
output value of industry(X5), temperature(X6) and precipitation(X7).

3 Results
The main results can be observed from Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3, in which TII
represents total indirect influence and PII represents proportion of indirect influence.

From our calculation, we find that consumption of three kinds of energy has a great
influence on the pollution situation of atmosphere environment. Table 1 shows that
the direct influence of total output value of industrial on waste water discharge is
relatively high, and its path coefficient is -0.9143, very close to its correlation
coefficients. The following is the quantity of population. Consumption of electric
power and consumption of coal have the greatest indirect influences on waste water
discharge through industry production and population quantity.

Population quantity, consumption of electric power, consumption of petroleum,
consumption of coal and total output value of industry all have great influences on
industrial solid waste discharge, the coefficients are 0.8117, 0.8571, 0,6690, 0.8490
and 0.8636 respectively, all positive. Since quantity of population, consumption of
petroleum and total output value of industry all have small direct influences on
industrial solid waste discharge, with path coefficients 0.0074, -0.6815 and 0.2054
respectively(Table 2), their indirect influences on industrial solid waste discharge are
great. The reason is that industrial solid waste discharge increases as the demand of
electric power goes up which is caused by population growth, consumption of
petroleum and industry production.

In Table 3, the indirect influence of quantity of population and consumption of
petroleum on waste gas discharge is high. Their correlation coefficients are all
positive, and path coefficients are -1.3508 and -0.1439 respectively. Consumption of
electric power has a great indirect influence on waste gas discharge, followed by
consumption of coal. Coal is the main energy for economic development. Industry
production, fire power station and daily life of residents all request large amount of
coal, so consumption of coal is the main reason of air pollution in our country.
Enhancing efficiency of energy utilization, developing clean coal technology,
improving the process of waste gas treatment, exploring and adopting efficient waste
gas treatment and comprehensive resource utilization technique is the fundamental
solution for air pollution.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, multi-path analysis model is used to analyze direct and indirect
influences of population, energy consumption, gross industrial output value,
temperature and precipitation on environment pollution in Anhui province, China,
from 1987 to 2004. The results show that production pattern of industry and electric
power consumption are main reasons of environmental pollution in Anhui province.
As far as Anhui is concerned, quantity of population and total output value of
industry all have high correlation degrees with waste water discharge and the direct
influence of the later on waste water discharge is larger than the former. While
population grows and industry develops, industry structure should be improved to
enhance the technology of waste water disposal, and thereby boosts harmonious
development.
While consumption of electric power has great direct influences on industrial solid
waste discharge and waste gas discharge, quantity of population and consumption of
petroleum all have great indirect influences on industrial solid waste discharge and
waste gas discharge through consumption of electric power. With population
growing, consumption of electric power will surely increase, leading to large amount
discharge of waste gas and waste residue. Controlling population quantity, improving
energy for generating electricity, exploring clean coal technology and increasing the
rate of energy utilization, all can to some extent reduce environment pollution.
