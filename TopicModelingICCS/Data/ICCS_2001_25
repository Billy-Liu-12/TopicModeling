Abstract. The problem of synthesis of the onboard integrated intellectual
complexes (IC) of decision support acceptance in fuzzy environment is
discussed. The approach allowing to formalize complex knowledge system
within the framework of fuzzy logic basis is formulated. Interpretation of fuzzy
models is carried out with use of high performance computing at processing
information stream in problems of analysis and forecast of worst-case situations
(disputable and extreme).

Introduction
The present research is connected with use of soft computing concept in onboard
integrated real time IC functioning. Formulation of practical recommendations and
decisions acceptance in complex dynamic object (DO) control in extreme conditions
is carried out on the basis of measurement data, mathematical models and the
structured knowledge base (KB). The fundamental basis of research is theoretical
principles of formalization of knowledge used in the organization of designing and
systems functioning having in view their discrepancy and uncertainty, and also their
algorithmic processing in decisions acceptance or in choice of operations for
purposeful actions support. Practical realization of this problem is connected with
development of effective algorithms of the analysis of the information obtained from
measuring system and from procedural components of KB. Aspects of fuzzy logic
allow to formalize discrepancy and uncertainty in the description of information and
procedural elements of soft computing processes. Artificial neural networks (ANN)
and genetic algorithms (GA) allow to organize training during calculations
performance and their high-performance realization.

1. Conceptual Model and IC Architecture

interacting with the environment is connected with application of the measuring
means and methods of analyzing the original information and supercomputer
technology.

The invariant kernel of the system includes the problem field, KB and DB of IC.
For creation of this set conceptual model of IC is formed. The consideration of system
in functional aspect allows to pick out the following components [3,5]:
<SF, SM, SW>

(1)

where SF = {SF1, …, SFN} is the set of functional subsystems; SM is structural scheme of
the system; SW are conditions of formation of complete system;
SF=<X, Y, A, PF, TF>, SM = <E, C, �, PM, TM>, SW = <G, R, UR, KR, Ef>
where X = Xj (j = 1,…, n) is the vector-set of input signals; Y = Yi (i = 1,…, m) is the
vector-set of output signals; A : {X � Y} is the operator determining process of

PF ={�F }; PF ={�F }; PF ={�F } are the parameters for considered subsets; TF is the
set of the time moments, invariant to object of modeling; E = Ev (v = 1,…, Nv ) is the
set of system components; C = Cq (q = 1,…, Qc ) is the set determining relations

set of the time moments of dynamic structures; G are the purposes of functioning of
object in realization of a task R; UR are the principles and algorithms of management
of object; KR is an execution result quality; Ef is the efficiency determining at what
price the purpose G is achieved.
Problem of selection of optimal requirements to quality operation index Ql
(l=1,…,L) and of characteristics of IC tools Cs (s=1,…,N) in conditions of
incompleteness and indefiniteness of initial data is formulated on the basis on Zadeh’
generalization principle [9]. In accordance with this principle possibilities of
considered indexes realization are defined by the following:
for IC characteristics

with fuzzy sets

It is possible to present optimal solution of problem for fuzzy goals Q and fuzzy
possibilities PQ having in view conditions (2) and (3) as
��Ql(ql) � �Ql(ql)�max

The realization of (1)–(4) is connected with the decision of the following
functional tasks:
� diagnosing of the current condition of environment and dynamic object;
� recognition and classification of situation;
� the forecast of development of situation;
� search of control strategy;
� change of the current condition of dynamic object and forecast of its behavior
under influence of the control decisions
Imitative modeling, procedure of the statistical and spectral analysis, filtration and
forecast, identification and recognition of images are used as the mathematical tools
for development of control algorithms.
The architecture of onboard IC is shown in the fig.1. The complex contains
intelligence subsystems functioning on the basis of dynamic measurement data.
Analysis and forecast of situations development and decisions acceptance are
provided by means of the training system realizing adaptive component functions.

2. Fuzzy Parallel Systems
Development of IC software is based on the following artificial intellect paradigms. A
basic element of information model of a considered subject domain is fuzzy
production KB model. The conceptual model of IC functioning is formulated having
in view requirements to information, computing and measuring technology. The
formalized knowledge system is created by method of synthesis of control algorithm
and decisions acceptance in conditions of uncertainty and incompleteness of the initial
information.
Fuzzy logic inference is carried out with the help of modified modus ponens on the
basis of the results of the current measurements [1], [8].
«If X, then Y, else Z» (X � Y(Z))
(5)

968

where X, Y, Z - are fuzzy sets defined on universal sets U, V, W. The sets X, Y, Z are
interpreted as a fuzzy input and output of some system. The relationship between
these sets is defined by fuzzy system model.
The result of given conditional fuzzy operator completing (5) is characterized by
the expression
�(X�Y(Z)) = {�x/�(Y), (1-�x)/�(Z)}

(6)

where �x is truth degree of condition X.
Uniqueness of the defined group of operators is determined after calculating �x in
accordance with given threshold of the truth degree �0 � [0,1]:
�(�) = (�(Y), if �x � �0 ) or (�(Z), if �x<�0 )

(7)

where �(�) is a result of operators completing.
Specific feature of computing systems of new generation is orientation on
knowledge processing and parallel functioning. Parallelism is inherent in knowledge
processing systems. Therefore in perspective computer technologies design the
problems of knowledge representation models adaptation to new computer
architecture and hardware-software designing to suit highly effective parallel models
of knowledge representation occur. Two approaches in fuzzy logic conclusion
realization in onboard IC are used:
� Modus ponens based on minimax composition of entrance FS and the fuzzy
relation "input-output" which describes a rule of decision acceptance;
� Situational inference based on fuzzy recognition of the situation by comparison of
its description with the description of standard fuzzy situations.
Comparative analysis of these approaches is published in [12].
Development of methods and software of generation and alternatives choice on the
basis of initial information on a situation being researched allows to rationally
organize decision support system functioning. Analysis allows to determine set (A0)
of minimal dimension among known set of alternatives (A), each of which (an) is
estimated by one or several generalized criteria of quality Kq. Then, for any
alternative ai�A, the alternative aj�A0 , concerning which conditions
Kq(aj�A0) > Kq(ai�A)

(8)

are true is put in conformity.
The considered class of systems is characterized by the fact that for situations set
there is a certain number of allowable decisions. Then the set of situations is broken
into classes in such manner that the unique decision with necessary practical
recommendations is put in conformity for each of these classes. The mechanism
providing functioning logic and decisions development in process of entry of
information on object dynamics and on environment is based on decisions conclusion
with the help of formal procedure:
Fi: Sk(ti) � Uj, k=1,…,n; j=1,…,J; i=1,…,N,.
based on the initial data concerning control decisions {ui}.

Fig. 2. Build-in data analysis and interpretation procedures in IC

In IC functioning in complex conditions inference rules usually contain the built in procedures of analysis and interpretation of measurement data (fig.2). In this case
situations when the current measurement data result in various interpretation may
arise. Then expansion of analogical inference rule [4] on fuzzy systems may be used.
The approach developed by authors allows to carry out a fuzzy inference in the
following sequence:
� the built-in procedures are realized and their efficiency is checked by
mathematical modeling methods ;
� according to modeling results membership functions of antecedent parts are
constructed;
� inference is carried out on the basis of model ( 5 )
As an example, let us consider fuzzy model of floating DO extreme situation
identification by results of parameters �, �, � measurement (where � is rolling, � is
pitching, � is heaving) in the case when antecedent part of rule is described by
identical ratios

� � �
Pn: <if ��� A1 & � � A2 & � � A3 then �n � Bn>;
Pn+1: <if ���� A1 & �� � A2 & �� � A3 >
<���B1> - more likely.
Here P1,…, Pn is group of situations allocated during search of identification
problem decision; Pn+1 is the premise which is described on the basis of measurement
results with the help of appropriate MF; <���B1> is the result which is determined
during realization of fuzzy model (10) where MF of fuzzy set �� is calculated
according to mathematical modeling for a situation characterized by higher truth
degree (in this case for situation P1).
Using structure (5), it is possible to present result (10) as a composite rule
Y� = X� � (X � Y);
(11)
Y� = X� � R;
R=[ r i j] ( i=1,…,m; j=1,…,n)
and to realize parallel inference applying maximin composition and taking of
minimum as fuzzy implication:

�Y ’ �

� � � x� �� � x , y� � � �
X’

x �X

X ’� X

� x � �� Y � y �

(12)

then MF is realized on basis of ANN.
One of complex problems in the organization of fuzzy inference procedure in
parallel systems is preliminary processing of the measuring information and
realization of procedures of data analysis and interpretation for fuzzy knowledge
formation. This knowledge allows to construct MF of fuzzy hypothesis in inference
models and also to provide realization of imitating modeling and statistical procedures
of IC analysis in various operation conditions functioning especially in abnormal
situations. Such calculations demand realization of high performance computing with
the use of modern supercomputers [3]. Development of information processing
algorithms in real time represents the important aspect at realization of IC designing
computing technology requirements.
The paradigm of parallel calculations in realization of fuzzy logic inference
assumes use of various models of approximate reasoning. As one of approaches it is
possible to realize the algorithm offered in work [11]:
� preprocessor processing: construction of a matrix of parallelism and parallel sets
�i (i = 1,…, n) for all production models;
� initialization: input of initial condition S0 and installation of current value S = S0;
input of target condition Sk; if S = Sk, then stop;
� search of the decision (the basic production cycle): calculation of activation set for
current condition S (performance of a phase of production cycle comparison);
determination of parallel carried out productions subset from � � i , and obtaining
new current condition S; if S�Sk, then stop, otherwise return to the beginning of
decision search stage.

Interaction of rules in production system is fundamental concept in use of parallel
processing. Parallel products activation is allowable at their mutual independence.
Simultaneous performance of dependent rules may result in products interference
P={Pq} (q=1,…,Q) on to independent subsets.
A fuzzy neural network is one of the effective models for design of real time
systems KB. Such model was offered by authors [2] for realization of algorithm of
control vector formation of ship movement in ship-born IC. In this paper fuzzy
production model is used as knowledge representation model. The fuzzy logic
inference by results of current measurements is carried out with the help of the
modified modus ponens

Transformation of the entrance fuzzy variables (result of procedure (13)) in to an
accurate estimation u is realized with the use of defuzzification procedure. The
organization of antecedent parts of each rule calculations is carried out in fuzzy
multilayered ANN. Basic elements of a network are fuzzy «AND» and «OR» formal
neurones. During preprocessing an input vector calculation of measures of an
opportunity (13) is stipulated. Values of synaptic weights are formed during training
according to algorithm of optimization problem decision offered in work [13].
Elements of control vector are calculated on the basis of production model.
Calculation by modus ponens is carried out in blocks of "MAX" operation. Accurate
values of vector elements are formed according to defuzzification method in blocks
«df».
Neural network approach to the calculations organization according to intellectual
algorithm of ship control allows to provide IC functioning in real time. Increase of
intellectuality degree of onboard integrated IC is achieved due to use of soft
computing concept. Principles of fuzzy logic allow to formalize inaccuracy and
uncertainty in the description of information and procedural elements of soft
computing processes. ANN allow to organize training during calculations and high
performance realization. The practical application of the soft computing concept at
design of onboard IC for underwater device is considered in [10]. The KB of IC is
represented as fuzzy models. Tabulated values of FM are stored in a database. The
fuzzy inference is carried out with the help of modus ponens and procedure of
accurate interpretation (defuzzification). Complexity of the intellectual control law
has resulted in necessity of use of the computing procedures focused on performance
in multiprocessor computing environment on the base of neural network models.
Realization of this technology has allowed to set off optimum structures from the
suboptimum decisions found during GA work.

3. Decisions Acceptance in Fuzzy Environment
One of the most complex ways of on-board IC development is connected with
development of tools ensuring functioning of integrated systems on the basis of a
complex information flow. They include information from sensors of measuring
system and results of mathematical modeling. The practical realization of the
developed concept of analysis and forecast of dynamics of complex objects is carried
out with using of supercomputer technologies ensuring the large resource of memory
and speed. The functions of multiprocessor system are realized on the basis of the
distributed architecture ensuring modularity of constructions and an opportunity of
upgrading, reliability, distribution of loading and parallel processing of the
information.
During IC functioning the control is carried out as a sequence of steps u(�,v,R) = ui
(i=1,…,m). Local control goal is matched to each step.
As a result the dynamic object comes into certain condition S(u) = Sj (j=1,…,n) and
has target signals Y(U,R)=Yk (k=1,… q). Quality of IC work to obtain practical
th
recommendations on r a step is

�

�( r ) � � S k , S f

�

(14)

where �(r) is error function; Sk is technical condition of dynamic object (forecast); Sf
is actual technical condition
The value of error function is defined by reliability of the algorithms incorporated
in formalized knowledge system.
To increase of efficiency of IC functioning the methods of the theory of
experiment design are used. The problem of experiment design in real-time systems is
connected with solution of the following problems:
� construction of optimum structure of mathematical models for adaptive
components realization;
� choice of optimum conditions of measurements ensuring a reliable estimation of
dynamic object characteristics and parameters of environment;
� development of algorithms of measuring information analysis
Algorithm of decision-making process defines a sequence of the procedures
connected to interpretation of situations, development and analysis of alternatives,
formulation of criteria, risk calculation and estimation, choice of way out variant ,
realization and check of the decision.
Object structurization as decisions tree allows to present logic decision functions of
recognition, of the analysis and forecasting of considered situations. Construction of
decisions tree subseting Ak into M images assumes:
� variables·set X�Xk (k=1,…, N) with value areas D1,…, DN and D1�…�DN
� variables set x�xk(a) for object a�Ak (k=1,…,N);
� separation of set D into pairs crossing subsets

(15)

In case of failure of initial information analysis with the help of traditional methods
the decision is transferred to formation of the structure providing problem solution.
The basis of such structure are the approximated methods and algorithms including

Fuzzy Logic Basis in High Performance Decision Support Systems

973

approaches using nonconventional procedures (neural network logic basis, GA, etc.).
In particular, algorithms of measuring system sensors parrying contain procedures of
intelligence sensors creation basing on associative ANN and imitating modeling
methods. Formation of the adaptive computing procedures which are taking into
account volume and reliability of the initial data, makes one of the important trends in
decision support systems design.
Process of decision support system synthesis is a sequence of hierarchical structure
analysis operations. The elementary subtasks in this structure are analyzed
preliminarily by method of hierarchies [7]. Realization of this method is connected to
allocation of priorities (weights) of attributes with a view of choice of the best of them
with the use of algebraic theory of matrixes and expert procedures:

� �11
�
W� � � max �; � � � �
�� � n1

�
� ij
�

�1m � � g1 �
� � �
� � � � � �,
� nm �� �� gm ��

(16)

where W is the inverse symmetric matrix of values of paired comparisons of attributes
concerning the given attribute; � is the normalized vector of attributes weights; �max
is the greatest eigenvalue of matrix W; � is the result of determination of global
priorities of attributes �1,…, �N; N is the number of attributes; �ij (i=1,…, n,
j=1,…,m) is the relative weight of i-th attribute on j-th attribute; gj is the relative
weight of j-th attribute.
During such analysis attributes, to which the minimal global priority values
correspond are allocated. The obtained data allow to generate space of the alternatives
determining DO condition and control decisions, providing task performance. The
result is achieved by finding compromise between the allocated space of alternatives
*
Aq and attributes dictionary volume {xi}. Realization of developed information

4. Results of Experiments
Practical realization of the developed technology is carried out as the integrated
onboard complex of a navigation safety.
The IC full-scale tests have been carried out aboard a tanker in the Baltic Sea,
aboard a container ship in a voyage in the Mediterranean and in the Atlantic and on a
small ship in the Black Sea. The most complete investigation of the IC operation was
checked on the small ship, where the ship motions on waves were chosen according to
specially developed program.
In the course of the test operation the dynamic characteristics measurements, this
system adaptation and completion of the designing process, receiving new knowledge
about the ship behavior on seas and its integration with the old one were carried out.
The following factors were of special practical interest: testing the reliability of the
applied methods for estimating and predicting the seas parameters, the transverse
stability characteristics and the KB reaction to the standard and non-standard
situations arising in the seaway. All this allowed us to correct the mathematical
models of the interaction of the ship and environment, the mechanism of logical
output and the procedure of decision making on the basis of fuzzy aims and
limitations.
The test proved the possibility of practical evaluation and prediction of the
dynamic characteristics, of the reliability of KB operation under various conditions of
service. The selective data of wave prediction are shown in [6], seaworthiness
experiments are shown in table 1
