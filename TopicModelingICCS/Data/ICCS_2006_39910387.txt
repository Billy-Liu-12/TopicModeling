Abstract. Malaria is one of the most dangerous diseases affecting primarily
poor people of tropical and subtropical regions. The search for novel drugs
against specific parasites is an important goal for antimalarial drug discovery.
This study describes how 3D pharmacophores for antimalarial activity could be
developed from known antimalarials and be used as screening tools for virtual
compound libraries to identify new antimalarial candidates with examples of
indolo[2,1-b]quinazoline-6,12-diones (tryptanthrins) that exhibited in vitro activity below 100 ng/mL. These models mapped on the potent analogues and
also onto other well-known antimalarial drugs of different chemical classes including quinolines, chalcones, rhodamine dyes, Pfmrk CDK inhibitors, malarial
KASIII inhibitors, and plasmepsin inhibitors. The pharmacophores allowed
search and identification of new antimalarials from in-house multi-conformer
3D CIS database and enabled custom designed synthesis of new potent analogues that are found to be potent against in vitro W2, D6, and TM91C235
strains of P. falciparum.

1 Introduction
Malaria, one of the most severe of the human parasitic diseases, causes about 500
million infections worldwide and approximately 3-5 million deaths every year. The
search for novel antimalarial drugs against specific parasitic targets is an important
goal for antimalarial drug discovery. [1] The situation is rapidly worsening mainly
due to non-availability of effective drugs and development of drug resistance of a
large number of non-immune people in areas where malaria is frequently transmitted.
[1] Chloroquine, mefloquine, and other frontline drugs for the treatment and prevention of malaria, are becoming increasingly ineffective. [1] Artemisinin analogues such
as artesunate and arteether were later introduced and found to be quite effective, particularly against drug-resistant P. falciparum, but observations of drug-induced and
dose-related neurotoxicity in animals have raised concern about the safety of these
compounds for human use.[2,3] Therefore, much effort and attention are needed for
discovery and development of new and less toxic antimalarial drugs.
Indolo[2,1-b]quinazoline-6,12-dione, known as tryptanthrin, is an alkaloid isolated
from the Taiwanese medicinal plant Strobilanthes cusia, and its substituted

derivatives (Table 1) were recently studied at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Silver Spring, Maryland, U.S.A.[4] and found to have remarkable in vitro
antimalarial activity against P. falciparum, both sensitive and multidrug-resistant
strains. The more potent analogs exhibit IC50 values in the range 0.43 to 10 ng/mL,
about one one-thousandth of the concentrations necessary to inhibit bacteria. Furthermore, the compounds are also found to be highly potent against strains of P. falciparum that are up to 5000-fold resistant to atovoquone, 50-fold resistant to chloroquine, and 20-fold resistant to mefloquine. Thus, this novel class of compounds has
opened a new chapter for study in the chemotherapy of malaria.
Computer assisted molecular modeling (CAMM) has made remarkable progress in
recent years in the design and discovery of new potential bioactive chemical entities.[5] The current advances in these methodologies allow direct applications ranging
from accurate ab initio quantum chemical calculations of stereoelectronic properties,
generation of three-dimensional pharmacophores, virtual database searches to identify
potent bioactive agents, to simulate and dock drug molecules in the binding pockets
of proteins that are crucial and directly related to biomedical research.
In continuation of our efforts to design and discover new antimalarial therapeutic
agents using computational methodologies [6,7], we present here our reported [4] 3D
chemical feature based pharmacophore model and its utility as a tool for 3D database
searches for identification of new structurally different classes of compounds for
further study.

2 Results and Discussion
Three-dimensional pharmacophore for antimalarial activity was found to contain two
hydrogen bond acceptor (lipid) functions and two aromatic hydrophobic functions at a
specific geometric positions (Fig. 1) of the tryptanthrins was reported by us earlier.
[5] The pharmacophore was developed using the CATALYST methodology [8] from
a set of 17 structurally diverse tryptanthrin derivatives including the parent compound
as the training set shown in Table 1. The correlation between the experimental and
predicted activity of these compounds were found to be as R = 0.89. The more potent
analogs of the training set (Table 1) such as 1 and 4 map well with the pharmacophore
(Fig. 2a & 2b) whereas, the less potent analogues such as 11 and 16 do not map adequately with the hypothesis (Fig. 2c & 2d). Cross-validation of the generated pharmacophore was carried out by preparing a “test set” of 15 additional tryptanthrin compounds (Table 1) that were tested for in vitro antimalarial activity against D6 and W2
clones of P. falciparum identical to the original training set. The predicted and the
experimental IC50 values for the test set tryptanthrins are found reasonably well reproduced [4], correlation as R = 0.92, within the limits of uncertainty [3], thus demonstrating the predictive power of the original pharmacophore. As observed in the
training set, the more potent analogues of the test set such as 4’ and 11’ map well
(Fig. 3a & 3b) with the pharmacophore whereas, the less potent analogues of the test
set do not map adequately.
To further examine the validity of the pharmacophores, its features were
mapped onto a series of eight antimalarial drugs that are currently used in the United
States [3]; viz., quinine, chloroquine, mefloquine, primaquine, hydroxychloroquine,

pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine, and doxycycline (Fig. 4). The mapping indicates that
quinine completely satisfies the requirement with the pharmacophore (Fig. 4a)
whereas, the other drugs map in varying degrees. It may be worthwhile to mention
here that quinine and other quinoline-containing antimalarials including chloroquine
have shown varying capacity to inhibit malaria heme polymerase extracted from P.
falciparum tropozoites. [9] In particular, the interaction of quinine with heme has
been well documented. [10] Since the pharmacophore maps well on quinine and in
varying degrees on the other quinoline-containing antimalarials, it may be reasonable
to speculate that the tryptanthrin compounds may target heme polymerase from the P.
falciparum tropozoites. Preliminary results from NMR experiments on select tryptanthrin analogues have shown positive indications toward inhibition of the hemin polymerization process (unpublished results). In addition, we have also mapped the
pharmacophore on a few recently reported potent antimalarials such as the chalcones11 and rhodacyanine dyes. [12] Surprisingly again, the more potent chalcone
analogues such as, 2’,3’,4’-trimethoxy-4-trifluoromethyl and 2’,4’-dimethoxy-4-ethyl
chalcones (Fig 5a & 5b) and the rhodacyanine dye MKT-077 and its para analogue
map well on to the tryptanthrin pharmacophore (Fig 6a & Fig 6b). In addition, the
pharmacophore led to a search of the in-house multiconformer 3D databases that led
to the identification of a fairly potent plasmepsin inhibitor: 6-diethylamino-2,3diphenylbenzofuran, two excellent Pfmrk inhibitors from the tryptanthrin classes,
such the 8-nitro- and 7-chloro-4-azatryptanthrins, and a moderately good inhibitor, 4(benzenesulfonamido)-salicylic acid for the malarial KASIII enzyme. [4]

3 Conclusions
The study demonstrates how the chemical features such as the hydrogen bond donors,
acceptors, hydrophobicity etc. of potent compounds can be organized to develop
pharmacophores for activity and utilize them for virtual in silico search of new class
of compounds to open new chapters for chemotherapeutic study. Specifically, in this
investigation we have shown how molecular characteristics from a set of diverse
tryptanthrin derivatives may be organized to be both statistically and mechanistically
significant for potent antimalarial activity that may have universal applicability. In
addition, the resulting model can be used to unravel a possible rationale for the targetspecific antimalarial activity of these compounds. The validity of the pharmacophore
extends to structurally different class of compounds, and thereby provides a powerful
template from which novel drug candidates may be identified for extended study.
Since the identity of the target for antimalarial activity of these compounds is unknown, the three-dimensional QSAR pharmacophore should aid in the design of
well-tolerated target-specific antimalarial agents.
