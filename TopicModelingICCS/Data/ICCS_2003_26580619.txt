Abstract. Data assimilation based on a variational principle for parameter
estimation of 2-D advection-dispersion equations is considered. It is assumed
that a priori estimations for the model parameters and the initial condition are
available. Improvement of parameters for the radionuclide transport model is
reduced to an optimization problem with quadratic cost functional. The cost
functional comprises the measurement model and model errors, the initial
condition uncertainty and parameter penalties. The existence of a unique
solution for the state equations and the adjoint system is proved. Differential
properties of the cost functional are investigated and a necessary condition for
cost functional minimum is derived. Restrictions on the cost functional weights,
which guarantee the existence of a unique stationary point, are derived.

1 Introduction
In this paper we concentrate on parameter estimation for the advection-dispersion
equations, which, for example, can be used to describe radionuclide transport by
surface water flow. The radionuclide transport in the aqueous phase and on suspended
sediments by surface water flow is governed by the equations with the sink-source
term describing physical-chemical interactions and erosion-deposition exchange
processes [1-2]

Values of the partition coefficients kd (x), kd (x) and exchange rates αs(x), αb(x) are
determined by the soil physical-chemical properties and forms of radionuclide
contamination. These coefficients characterize the interchange between the various
radionuclide forms. So a forecast quality of radionuclide contamination of surface
reservoirs depends on accuracy determination of their values. Experience of the
Chernobyl accident has shown that exact values of the partition coefficient and
exchange rates are unknown just after accident and at the best their estimations are
only available.
Nowadays data assimilation methods used for parameter estimation is based on
estimation theory or control theory [3]. Estimation theory usually involves a
sequential estimations of both model and data errors by using a statistical approach.
Control theory methods are generally based on variational principles.
In this paper, we consider variational assimilation approach [4] for parameter
estimation of the model of radionuclide transport by surface water flow. In this case,
parameter estimation problem reduces to minimization of a quadratic cost functional
on a set of admissible values of the model parameters in neighborhood of their a priori
estimations. On the set of admissible values of the model parameters the differential
properties of the cost functional are investigated, a necessary condition for a
minimum of the cost functional is derived, and a sufficient condition for existence of
a unique stationary point is obtained.

where the constant M depends only on σ, σ1, γ, γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, T, ∂Ω and

The solvability of the initial-boundary value problem (4), (6)-(7) can be proved by
using the Galerkin method in similar way as in [5].
Corollary. Let the coefficients of the equation (4) satisfy the restrictions (5) on Uad.
The matrices H(x), R0(x) are bounded and measurable on Ω and have bounded
derivatives with respect to x, and c d ( x ) ∈ W&21 ( Ω ) .

as k→∞.

(20)

According to the Theorem 1, the problem (4), (6)-(7) admits a unique solution on
Uad such that c( x, t ; u ) W 2,1 (Q ) ≤ M 1 , where the constant M1 does not depend on u.

Due to boundedness of the solutions c(x,t;u) on Uad and boundedness of the set Uad

there is a subsequence {u } of the sequence {u } that

c(x,t;u ) → c% ( x, t ) weakly in W22,0,1 (Q ) ,
µN → µ% and νN → ν% in E2×m,

0N
c → c%0 weakly in W&21 ( Ω ) ,
N
• r → r% weakly in L2(Q).
0N
Moreover, from the imbedding theorems [6, pp.35-36], we have that c converges to

•

c%0 in L2(Ω) and c( x, t ; u N ) − c% ( x, t )

L2 ( Ω )

→ 0 as N→∞ uniformly with regard to

t∈[0,T]. Since Uad is a closed convex set, the set Uad is weakly closed and

(

u% = µ% ,ν%, r%, c%0

)

T

∈ U ad .

It is easy to show that c% ( x, t ) coincides with c( x, t ; u% ) . To show this, it is
N
sufficiently in (18)-(19) written for the c(x,t;u ) to pass to the limit as N→∞. Hence,
the function c% ( x, t ) is a solution of the problem (4), (6)-(7) for u = u% .
The functional ℑ ( u, c( x, t ; u ) ) is a convex continuous functional of the arguments,
so it is weakly lower semicontinuous and

(

)

lim ℑ u N , c( x, t ; u N ) ≥ ℑ ( u%, c% ( x, t ) )

N →∞

Therefore from (20) follows

ℑ ( u% , c% ( x, t ) ) ≤ inf ℑ ( u , c( x, t ; u ) ) .
u∈U ad

Thus ℑ ( u% , c% ( x, t ) ) = inf ℑ ( u, c( x, t ; u ) ) and u% ∈ U ∗ .
u∈U ad

It remains for us to show that the set U is weakly compact. Let’s take an arbitrary

sequence {u }∈U . Then {u }∈Uad and there is a subsequence {u } which converges

weakly to some point u% ∈ U ad . But ℑ u N , c( x, t ; u N ) = inf ℑ ( u, c( x, t ; u ) ) ,

N=1,2,…, so {u } is a minimizing sequence. As shown above, the {u } converges
weakly to U , therefore u% ∈ U ∗ . Hence, the set U is weakly compact that completes
the proof.
Let’s remark that the set of solutions of the problem (4), (6)-(7) is non-convex,
therefore a minimum of the cost functional can be non-unique.

5 Sufficient Condition of Existence of Stationary Points
In the previous section has been shown that the set of minimum of the cost functional
(9) on Uad is non-empty. But the point of cost functional minimum can be both
interior, and boundary point of Uad. It is clear that an interior point of cost functional
minimum is the stationary point.
Theorem 4. Let state function c(x,t;u) is governed by the first initial-boundary value
problem (4), (6)-(7), the coefficients of which satisfy to restrictions (5). Let the set of
admissible model parameters Uad is a convex closed bounded set and the following

are defined by (22).
Really, we can rewrite the stationarity conditions (21) as the following operator
equation u = F (u ) . It is obviously that under assumptions of Theorem 4, the operator
F is contracting and mapping the set Uad into itself.
