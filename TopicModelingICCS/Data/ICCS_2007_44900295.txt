Abstract. Mobile devices pay the telecommunication cost of downloading Internet data proportional to the amount of data transferred. This
paper introduces a special ad hoc network in which several mobile devices, called peers, to cooperate each other to reduce the overall cost to
download Internet content. Each peer downloads a speciﬁc portion of the
content over 3G connection and exchanges the portion with other peers
over the ad hoc connection in order that all participating peers are able
to reconstruct the whole content. This paper proposes a peer-based content distribution method, and compares its performance with a similar
one named per-packet based distribution method. The simulation results
indicate that per-peer based method outperforms the per-packet based
method. In addition, approximately 90% of the telecommunication cost
is saved with as few as 10 peers.
Keywords: ad hoc network, 3G, peers, content distribution.

Introduction

Current wireless telecommunication services provide high speed Internet access
as well as voice service. Fig. 1 displays a situation in which many nearby mobile
devices connect to the Internet via their wireless telecommunication links to their
ISPs and then access their favorite content. Suppose the devices in the ﬁgure try
to download the same ﬁle stored at a content provider (CP), such as mobile game
programs, MP3 ﬁles, or movie clips. This situation may happen in many places.
For example, a teacher may want to share some educational content with his/her
students indoor and outdoor. Some friends may download an interesting mobile
game program that they want to store on their mobile devices and play together
interactively. In a sports stadium, spectators may want to retrieve the records of
their home team and favorite players in a game. Since it is expected that the 3G
connection cost to download data from the Internet is a function of the amount
of data downloaded, the cost of the telecommunication connections to access
the Internet may be reduced when each mobile device is assigned to download
a given portion of the target ﬁle and shares its portion with other devices. This

Fig. 2. Downloaded portions are exchanged over the ad hoc connection

paper proposes a low-cost sharing schemes in which mobile devices download in
parallel their assigned portions of the target ﬁle via their 3G connections, and
then build an ad hoc network (that has no fee for data transferred) to exchange
the remaining portions of the ﬁle. This may be possible if each mobile device
has both a 3G interface for wireless wide area network (WWAN) access such as
UMTS or CDMA2000 and a wireless local area network (WLAN) interface, such
as 802.11 or Bluetooth, to form an ad hoc network [1].
The left side of Fig. 2 illustrates the mechanism for partitioning the target
ﬁle and downloading the assigned portions by the mobile devices. Each mobile
device is assigned a portion of the target ﬁle to download. Each device connects
to its favorite ISP with its 3G link and contacts the CP with the aid of its
associated server in order to request its assigned portion of the ﬁle. The main
diﬀerence between Fig. 1 and the left side of Fig. 2 is the thickness of the 3G connection, which represents the amount of data downloaded for each mobile device.
In Fig. 1, each mobile device downloads the entire content from the CP. However, the thin line in the left side of Fig. 2 indicates that each device downloads
only a portion of the target ﬁle. Upon completion of downloading the speciﬁed
portion of the ﬁle, the mobile devices use their ad hoc connections to exchange

Peer-Based Eﬃcient Content Distribution in Ad Hoc Networks

their content with other member devices. The right side of Fig. 2 shows that
all mobile devices participate by exchanging their partial content with others in
order to reconstruct the target ﬁle.
The idea of the cooperating ad hoc network concept is often described as peerto-peer computing [2]. In [3], the peers download an assigned portion of a target
ﬁle and distribute their portions to all other peers based on the per-packet based
method. Fairness issues of the multiple sources to single receiver (multipoint-topoint) is studied in [4]. SplitStream [5] allows a source peer to split a ﬁle into
k stripes and to multicast each stripe using k multicast trees. In BitTorrent [6],
when many downloaders try to download a ﬁle(s) from a URL-speciﬁed location,
the downloaders upload to each other concurrently to help reducing the load of
the source. The authors in [7] proposed an approach for computing a schedule
for coordinated data collection with avoiding congested links and maximizing
the network resource utilization.
This paper focuses mainly on the data distribution method among participating peers. This method is based on a per-peer policy in which all peers are
ordered to transmit their packets one peer at a time. They all know which peer
is its predecessor. When a peer transmits some number of data packets, the
content is delivered only to the sender’s one-hop neighbors. At the end of the
current peer’s transmission, the peer sends a special packet that triggers the
transmission of the next peer. The transmission process ﬁnishes when all peers
receive the complete target ﬁle.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deals with two distribution methods. Simulation results are explained in section 3. Section 4 draws
conclusions.

2.1

Data Distribution Methods
Network Formation

The work in [3] describes the special ad hoc network formation. One of the
device users, called a peer, initiates a connection to its ISP and contacts a
special server on the Internet. The server becomes the associated server of the
peer. Each peer needs to have its associated server. The associated server may be
located at the ISPs, the CPs, or some other place within the Internet. A server
may be associated with several peers. For some cases, all peers may connect
to a single server that controls the operation of the ad hoc network and deals
with any license issues and fees with CPs at a bulk rate on behalf of the peers.
The associated server of the initiating peer plays an additional role of the master
server. The master server deals with several management tasks for the special ad
hoc network including the computation of the download scheduling that decides
which peers to download which portions of the target ﬁle.
Each peer downloads only a portion of the target ﬁle, but needs to acquire
complete content. In order to reconstruct the ﬁle, every peer becomes a sender
as well as a receiver. However, if all peers, as senders, transmit their content
in an uncontrolled manner, the broadcast storm problem [8] may arise. Each

298

peer needs a controlled way of broadcasting its received data to other member
peers. A per-packet based distribution method [3] selects the rebroadcasting set
of peers in order to propagate content to other peers because some peers are out
of transmission range of others. When a peer transmits one unit-sized packet of
downloaded data that is new to other peers, the data packet travels over the
ad hoc network by rebroadcasting from some selected rebroadcasting peers, if
needed. If all peers receive the packet, the scheduled next peer transmits another
unit-sized packet of downloaded data. Per-packet transmission repeats until all
peers receive the complete content.
2.2

Per-Peer Based Distribution

In the per-packet distribution method, one packet from one peer is forwarded
to all other peers at a time. Then, the next scheduled peer takes a turn to
transmit its next unit-sized packet. This delivery method, however, shows some
ineﬃciency while transmitting packets. Peers located at the central area may experience heavy packet collisions. In addition, for some moment, non-data packets
such as DONE packets may dominate the ad hoc network, which increases the
completion time and degrades the transmission performance.
A per-peer based distribution method decreases the chance of packet collision
and increases the time for more data packets transmitted, which results in shorter
completion time, less 3G communication costs, and less power consumption than
that of the per-packet based method. In the per-peer based distribution, only one
peer has a chance to transmit several unit-sized data packets to its neighbors at
a time. In addition, the data packets are not immediately forwarded, which reduces the possibility of packet collision. Each peer independently decides which
unit-sized data to broadcast depending on the reception status of its neighbors.
The neighbors do not rebroadcast any packet immediately, but wait for their
transmission turn. When the current transmitting peer has ﬁnished broadcasting a given number of packets, it broadcasts a DONE packet. If a scheduled
next peer is directly connected with the current peer, the next peer resumes its
transmission after selecting which data to send. If the next peer is out of range
from the current peer, the DONE packet contains a list of rebroadcasting peers
that forward the DONE packet toward the next-scheduled transmitting peer.
The master server creates and maintains a transmission sequence as a circular
list of peers using global topology information. Fig. 3 illustrates one example of
a 3-hop ad hoc network. The master server constructs the list with the following
rules. The server prefers the peer that has the largest number of neighbors. Then
it selects the peer that is directly connected with the previously selected peer.
If there is no unselected peers that have direct connection with the recently selected peer, the server chooses the peer with the minimum number of hops from
the previously selected peer. Fig. 3 (b) is one possible example of the transmission sequence as a circular list. Peer B is selected ﬁrst and subsequently peer E,
A, and D are choosen. Because peer D and F have no direct connection, the link

Fig. 3. A 3-hop network topology and its transmission sequence circular list

is shown as a dotted line. Peer D keeps a rebroadcasting set that includes peer
E for rebroadcasting a DONE packet. In addition, each peer maintains two-hop
neighborhood information. Much research have proposed distributed algorithms
that utilize two-hop neighborhood information [9,10,11,12]. When a peer receives
a packet, it immediately knows which peer also receives the same packet. This
knowledge may obviate some unnecessary transmissions of data packets.
2.3

Beneﬁt Value

One important value that each peer maintains for each unit-sized data segment
is the number of neighbors that do not have the segment. Because the target ﬁle
size is known and the data packet size can be deﬁned, e.g., 500 bytes, each peer
is able to compute how many unit-sized data are needed to construct the target
ﬁle. Suppose the target ﬁle size is 1 Mbyte and the unit packet size is 500 bytes,
2048 data packets are necessary. Each peer maintains both a bitmap size of 2048
bits and the same-sized integer array called the beneﬁt value. The bit in the
bitmap indicates the existance of the corresponding data segment stored in the
peer. The integer beneﬁt value implies the number of neighbors that do not have
the corresponding data segment. In case that a peer downloads some portion of
the target ﬁle from the Internet, the beneﬁt value(s) of the data segment(s)
is(are) set to the number of its neighbors, because no neighbor has the data
segment. The corresponding bit is also set, because the segment is in the peer.
When each peer resumes transmission, it selects the unit-sized data that has the
largest beneﬁt value, because the corresponding number of neighbor peers do not
have the data and they will get a beneﬁt to ﬁll the gap in the target ﬁle. This
also leads to increases a chance to discourage unnecessary data transmission by
other peers with the aid of the two-hop neighborhood information. In Fig. 3,
assume peer B sends a data packet whose beneﬁt value is four, and peer A, C,
E, and F receive the packet. Peer B’s beneﬁt value for the data becomes zero
after the transmission, because all its neighbor peers hold the data this time.
Both peer A and E computes a value of 1 for the data’s beneﬁt value, because
only peer D does not have the data. Further assume that peer E transmits the
data in its turn. Now peer A’s beneﬁt value of the data becomes zero and peer A
is unnecessary to transmit the data in case of its turn to transmit. If a peer has
all zero beneﬁt values, it immediately sends DONE packet when it is the peer’s
turn. This allows other peers with positive beneﬁt values to transmit data.

Simulation Results

The ns2 network simulator [13] is used in this simulation. The simulation model
assumes each peer downloads a portion of the target ﬁle using its 3G connection
that the master server schedules to download, while it exchanges the portions with
other peers using its ad hoc network. The peers do not experience buﬀer underrun
when they transmit their portions to other peers. The unit packet size of the 3G
connection is set to 500 bytes. The ad hoc network uses the same size of data packets. The peers download the target ﬁle size of 1 Mbytes that consists of 2048 unit
packets. Each peer has the 802.11 MAC with the transmission range of 250 meters.
The number of peers varies from 2 to 10. Because of the short amount of completion time described in [3], the mobility of peers is not considered. All peers are
located in a 400 meter by 400 meter grid unless speciﬁed otherwise. In case of perpeer based distribution, each peer transmits the maximum of 90 packets at a time
because the packet buﬀer size is set to 100 in the simulation. Each peer uploads
its new neighborhood information in a second. In all cases, an ad hoc network is
connected. That is, each peer is connected to at least one other peer.
The left side of Fig. 4 displays the average number of 3G packets used by the
peers that may have a fee charged by a telecommunication provider. Each value
in the ﬁgure is the average of 30 runs. As the number of peers increases, the number of fee-based packets decreases substantially. However, an additional peer only
reduces a marginal cost when there are already enough peers, whereas, the new
peer receives the same cost reduction. Approximately 90% of the telecommunication cost is saved with as few as 10 peers. The per-packet based method uses
slightly more packets on the 3G telecommunications link than that of per-peer
based method. This is due mainly to the recovery process in which each peer
uploads its bitmap reporting any data gaps to its associated server. Per-peer
based distribution resolves the gap by exchanging bitmaps with its neighbors
over the cost-free ad hoc connection.

Fig. 5. Number of packets on the 3G link and completion time by varying size of
simulation area

The completion time of each simulation is shown in the right side of Fig. 4.
Both horizontal lines are the average of 30 runs and the short vertical lines
represent the standard deviation of the 30 results. The average completion time
increases slowly as more peers participate. This is due to the increasing number
of hops in the network. As the number of peers increases, they may disperse over
the grid, which may increase the number of hops. More hops cause more time to
complete the distribution. The per-peer based distribution completes the content
distribution faster than that of the per-packet based one. One important point
is that as the number of peers increases, the diﬀerence of the two completion
times decreases. This result indicates that the number of hops in a network is
a more dominant factor than the density because per-peer based distribution
hardly experiences any collision.
When all peers are located within the transmission range of each other, no collisions are expected because only one peer transmits at a time. Fig. 5 illustrates
how the performance changes due to the change of the grid size. The simulation
runs with 10 peers and repeats 30 times with 30 diﬀerent network topologies.
The left side of Fig. 5 shows the number of packets on the 3G telecommunications link as the size of simulation area increases. A larger area may result
in a larger number of hops in a network, and more time to take to complete
the content distribution. Because peers upload their neighborhood information
periodically, longer completion time leads to increase the number of packets on
the 3G link as well. In addition, peers upload their bitmaps and download the
recovery instructions for per-packet based distribution, which consumes packets
on the 3G link. Due to more collisions in a larger area, the per-packet based
method uses more 3G packets than that of the per-peer based method. The
right side of Fig. 5 shows the completion time by varying the simulation area
size. The largest number of hops was 3 among 120 diﬀerent topologies used in
the ﬁgure. As the simulation size increases, so does the number of hops, which
causes longer completion time. Overall, the per-peer based distribution method

302

outperforms the per-packet based method in terms of the completion time, and
uses less packets on the 3G link.

Conclusion

Telecommunication cost may be one of the crucial factors for mobile device users
to access Internet content. This paper describes a special ad hoc network in which
mobile peers save telecommunication cost by sharing their partially downloaded
data with other peers. Each peer agrees to download a speciﬁed portion of the
target ﬁle located in the Internet using its fee-based WWAN connection. Each
participating peer distributes its downloaded portion to all other member peers
over the cost-free WLAN ad hoc connection so that all participating peers can
generate the complete target ﬁle. The per-peer based distribution method utilizes
the reception status of its neighbors using 2-hop neighbor information and the
beneﬁt value, and outperforms the per-packet based method. In addition, both
distribution methods save approximately 90% of the telecommunication cost
with as few as 10 peers.
