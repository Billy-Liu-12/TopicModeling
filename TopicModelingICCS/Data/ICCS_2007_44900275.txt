Abstract. Although shockwaves have been extensively adopted in traditional
traffic flow theory, how to detect shockwaves using an electronic vehicle detector has not been explored. Therefore, this study illustrates, for the first time, not
only how to detect shockwaves, but also how to obtain shockwaves from three
new traffic parameters: Stopped, Moving, and Empty. The Stopped parameter
attempts to identify a newly arrived shockwave equation when a traffic queue
approaches the electronic vehicle detector. The Moving and Empty parameters
derive another new arrival shockwave equation when the electronic vehicle detector fails to identify any queue. An algorithm is also created to demonstrate
how to use these parameters and equations to detect shockwaves. Additionally,
numerous simulations are conducted to identify the behaviors of new traffic parameters and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. Results of this study
demonstrate that the computing algorithm for electronic vehicle detectors can
accurately detect shockwaves.
Keywords: Shockwave, electronic vehicle detector, stopped, moving, empty.

1 Introduction
Shockwave analysis has long been adopted in traffic flow analysis.[1] Shockwaves
are defined as boundary conditions in the time-space domain that indicate a discontinuity in flow-density conditions.[2] Shockwaves result from sudden temporal or spatial changes in roadway density due to capacity or volume changes. Shockwave
analysis is an effective means of analyzing flow and queuing problems.[3,4] Numerous techniques have been proposed via which shockwaves can be plotted and employed to forecast traffic system performance.[1] Applications to freeway bottlenecks
and to traffic signals have also been developed.[5,6,7]
Most previous analyses and applications obtain shockwave values either via direct
provision or by computation based on changes in flow and density (shockwave,
w = Δq / Δk ). No previous investigation has studied methods for direct shockwave
detection for electronic vehicle detectors. This investigation is the first to illustrate a
method for shockwave detection for electronic vehicle detectors. Moreover, this investigation obtains, for the first time, shockwaves from three new traffic parameters

besides flow and density. The three new traffic parameters are Stopped, Moving, and
Empty. Two shockwave equations are derived from these three parameters. When a
traffic queue reaches an electronic vehicle detector, the shockwave equation can be
derived from the Stopped parameter. When no traffic queue is present at an electronic
vehicle detector, the Moving and Empty parameters are used to obtain another
shockwave equation. An algorithm is also devised to demonstrate how to use these
parameters and equations. Finally, CORSIM simulations were run for different combinations of scenarios to identify the behavior of new traffic parameters and the effectiveness of the computing algorithm.

2 Formulation
The formulation comprises four components. The first is the definitions of three new
traffic parameters: Stopped, Moving and Empty. The second is the use of Stopped to
detect shockwaves. The third is the use of Moving and Empty to detect shockwaves.
The fourth is the algorithm, which combines the three new traffic parameters and two
shockwave equations for shockwave detection.
2.1 Three Traffic Parameters: Stopped, Moving and Empty
Figure 1 provides the definitions of Stopped, Moving and Empty. Stopped refers to
the detection of a vehicle that continues beyond a specified time interval. Moving
means that the presence of a vehicle continues for less than a specified time interval.
Empty means that no presence of a vehicle is detected during a specified time interval. If the specified time interval is short and the traffic flow is high, the short Moving
and short Empty states alternate. Figure 1 shows the high sensitivity electronic detector. If the specified time interval is long and the traffic flow is high, the situation alternates between the long Stop, long Moving, and short Empty states. Figure 1 also
illustrates the low sensitivity electronic detector. An electronic detector can have a
low sensitivity, high sensitivity or both.

2.2 Using Moving and Empty Time for Shockwave Detection
When a high sensitivity electronic detector receives only Moving and Empty time, the
traffic queue does not reach the electronic detector. Figure 2 illustrates the Moving
time, vehicle and detection zones for such a traffic condition. Two vehicles with
speed V and length LV pass through a high sensitivity electronic detector with zone
length L Z . Each vehicle triggers the moving time as ( Lv + L z ) / v . Intuitively, the
summary of the Moving time is related to traffic flow. Hence, the arrival shockwave
W3 during time interval ΔT can be expressed as

average vehicle length and AvgLgap is the average gap length between two stopped
vehicles.

2.3 Using Stopped Time for Shockwave Detection
When traffic flow increases, traffic queue length gradually increases. If the traffic
queue extends back to the position of the electronic vehicle detector during a red
phase of a signalized intersection, the Stopped time is triggered. Generally, the
Stopped time of the electronic detector changes slowly for continued signal cycles.
Figure 3 displays the Stopped time for two continued signal cycles. The Stopped time
of the first cycle is OA , while that of the second cycle is OC . The Stopped difference

for these two continued cycles is AC , or ΔTC . Meanwhile, AC is the sum of
AB and BC . Furthermore, BC , or ΔTG , results from the difference in flow between

shockwave W12 and shockwave W13 during the green phase G . Moreover, AB ,
or ΔTR , results from the flow difference between shockwave W2 and shockwave

W3 during the red phase R . Furthermore, W3 denotes the shockwave of an arrival
flow, while W2 represents the shockwave of a special arrival flow in which total
queued vehicles during the red phase can be discharged based only on the green phase
time (in Fig.1). W1 is the shockwave of the saturated discharge flow.
Therefore
ΔTC = ΔTG + ΔTR .

Let point A be (0, 0) and set the x-y coordinate axis as in Fig.3. By using linear algebra,

ΔT R =

W1 R( W3 − W2 )
.
W3 ( W1 − W2 )

(4)

Similarly, let point E be (0, 0) and set the x-y coordinate axis. Thus,

ΔTG =

W1G( W1 − W3 )( W12 − W13 )
.
W3 ( W1 + W12 )( W1 + W13 )

(5)

Suppose the traffic flow follows the model of Greenshield [8]:

U = U f (1 −

K
).
Kj

(6)

where U denotes speed, U f represents free flow speed, K is density, and K j denotes traffic jam density. The following equations are then obtained:

W12 =

RW1W2
; W12 = U f − W1 − W2 ; W13 = U f − W1 − W3 .
GW1 − CW2

(7)

Substituting W12 and W13 (Eq.7) into Eq.(5) yields the new ΔTG :
ΔTG =

( GW1 − CW 2 ) 2 ( W3 − W1 )( W3 − W 2 )
( W1 − W 2 )W3 (( GW1 − CW 2 )W3 + CW 2 2 − GW1 2 )

.

(8)

To summarize, the following equation can be obtained.
ΔTC =

( GW1 − CW2 )2 ( W3 − W1 )( W3 − W2 )
( W1 − W2 )W3 (( GW1 − CW2 )W3 + CW2 2 − GW12 )

+

W1 R( W3 − W2 )
W3 ( W1 − W2 )

(9)

where parameters ΔTC , G , R , W1 , and W2 are all constants. Thus it is easy to obtain

W3 = f ( ΔTC ,G , R ,W1 ,W2 ) .
2.4 Algorithm

Meanwhile, Equation (9) demonstrates how to use Stopped time to detect arrival
shockwave. In Fig.4, the algorithm illustrated how to combine these two equations for
arrival shockwave detection.

3 Simulation Results
Two CORSIM frameworks have been created for assessing the three new traffic parameters and the proposed shockwave detection algorithm. One framework is designed
to identify the relations between environment and the three new traffic parameters. The
other is for testing the shockwave detection algorithm.
3.1 Three Traffic Parameters and Environment

The test example shown in Table 1 involves two adjacent intersections with a 700 feet
link at a fixed-timed traffic signal operating with a 60-s cycle length and a 23-s effective green interval. To determine the features of the three parameters and the effects
of environment change, eight scenarios were prepared and listed in Table 1: traffic
flow changing from 48 vph to 2880 vph, different detector zone size (20, 50 feet),
different vehicle detector distances to the stop bar (0, 30, 60,90,120,240 feet), and
next intersection spill back condition. Table 1 lists the test results. The arrows in Table 1 indicate the trend of traffic parameters.

3.2 Shockwave Detection

The other test example for arrival shockwave features two adjacent intersections with
a 997 foot link at a fixed-timed traffic signal operating with a 60-s cycle length and a
30-s effective green interval. Two electronic vehicle detectors are located 300 and
570 feet from the stop bar. The change sequence for the traffic flow is 650, 550, 600,
500, 700, 550, 400, 600 and 1000vph for every 900 seconds. Since the capacity is 600
vph, the v/c values vibrate around 1 and some traffic queues are formed. Figure 5
shows three traffic parameters in two electronic vehicle detectors. Notably, the
Stopped time of VD2 is always zero, indicating that no traffic queue exists over VD2.
Furthermore, the Stopped time of VD1 is occasionally near the effective red time
(30). Restated, some traffic queues are shown on VD1. Figure 6 summarizes the results from two different shockwave equations proposed in subsections 2.2 and 2.3.
According to this figure, each equation can only detect arrival shockwaves accurately
during a specific time interval. Figure 7 illustrates that the algorithm can obtain good
results. The detected arrival shockwave is almost identical to Corsim’s shockwave.

4 Conclusions
This work proposes, for the first time, three new traffic parameters and a new approach
to shockwave detection for electronic vehicle detectors. The proposed shockwave
detection approach comprises three major components: a shockwave equation derived
from the new Stopped parameter, the other shockwave equation derived from the new
Moving and Empty parameters, and an algorithm showing how to use the new parameters and equations to more accurately identify shockwaves. Different scenarios involving simulated environments were used to identify the behaviors of the three traffic
parameters. The proposed shockwave detection methodology was tested for a case
involving two adjacent intersections in a simulated environment. Simulated data from
two electronic vehicle detectors were used. Each electronic vehicle detector obtained
two Shockwave equations. The proposed algorithm selected the best of two equations
as the final shockwave. This study has demonstrated the feasibility of using the two
shockwave equations and algorithm for shockwave detection in urban intersections.
The proposed algorithm is easily applied and cost-effective since low cost electronic
detectors can be used to generate these three new parameters and detect shockwaves.
Further research is required to extend the concept to freeways and highways.
