Abstract. In this paper we describe a super-tree approach that is able
to use the information brought by hundreds of individual gene trees in
order to establish a reliable phylogeny of prokaryotes. Indeed, it has been
often shown that the use of single genes is not suﬃcient to solve such a
complex case. This is mainly due to problems like reconstruction artifacts, existence of hidden paralogies or the presence of numerous lateral
transfers. Here, our super-tree approach allowed us to build two trees
containing 86 prokaryotic organisms. All the major bacterial and archeal
taxonomic groups are monophyletic in these trees, which present some
striking diﬀerences with the classical view of prokaryotic phylogeny represented by the ribosomal RNA trees.

Introduction

Many attempts have been made since the precursor work of Woese [1] in order
to establish a reliable phylogeny of prokaryotic species (archaea and bacteria).
For a long time, the diﬀerent phylogenies produced using the Small Subunit of
ribosomal RNA (SSU rRNA) were considered as the best reference to reveal
the evolutionary history of the prokaryotic world [1]–[3]. On these trees, the
only well-supported positions were the taxonomic groups located near the base,
these groups being represented by hyperthermophilic bacteria, like those from
the Thermotoga or Aquifex genera. The lack of resolution between the other
divisions was interpreted as the proof of a rapid radiation of the organisms considered. This phenomenon has also been observed in many phylogenies based
on protein genes [4]. But improvements realized in methodology led to the conclusion that some parts of Woese’s trees were in fact reconstruction artifacts,
this especially for the position of hyperthermophiles [5]–[7]. Moreover, it seems
that even the supposed very stable rRNA genes could be horizontally transferred

between species, as some biological experiments suggest [8],[9]. Also, if the hypotheses about the massive occurrence of horizontal transfers between bacterial
species are true (see [10]–[14] for many examples), then it seems diﬃcult to use
other gene markers to reconstruct the phylogeny of these organisms. Another
problem is the fact that a lot of hidden paralogies exist among bacterial protein genes, and therefore risks of obtaining erroneous phylogenies are high when
using some markers. Since the availability of an increasing number of complete
genomes, several methods have been proposed to build genome-based trees, or to
test whether this concept makes sense for bacterial species. The most common
approaches are genes concatenation [15]–[17] and orthologous [18] or gene families content [19]–[21] comparisons among species. For concatenation methods,
the problem is that the number of genes that are both shared by the diﬀerent
species studied and alignable is very limited (only 23 in the case of [16]). And
for the comparison methods, it seems that they are only able to ﬁnd the relationships between closely related organisms. In that context, we introduced a
super-tree method based on the Matrix Representation using Parcimony (MRP)
coding scheme [22],[23]. This method already allowed us to produce a tree of
life containing 45 species for wich complete genomes were available [24]. At that
moment some important bacterial divisions were not represented in our data
set (mainly Fusobacteria and Chlorobiales), and incertitudes remained for some
parts of the tree. In this paper, we present a more complete study, realized on 86
prokaryotic genomes. The results of our analysis are partially in agreement with
the rRNA reference. However, some important diﬀerences bring raises questions
about bacterial phylogeny.

2.1

Material and Methods
Gene Families

A special release of the HOBACGEN database [25] called HOBACGEN-CG was
made, gathering all protein sequences into families of homologous genes from
the completely sequenced genomes of 76 bacteria and 10 archaea. We retained as
orthologous gene families only those containing one gene per species. Though this
approach may miss some hidden paralogy, especially in the case of archaea for
which only a few organisms are completely sequenced, this deﬁnition of orthology
has been shown to be much more accurate than a reciprocal BLAST hit based
one [26]. Protein sequences from hyperthermophilic bacteria having orthologues
only in archaea were removed from the family they belong to since these genes
are suspected to have been acquired by lateral transfers [27]–[29]. At last, only
families containing at least 30 species were considered for further analysis.
2.2

Alignments and Gene Trees Construction

The protein sequences of each family were aligned using CLUSTAL W [30], with
all default parameters. To select the parts of the alignments for which homology

702

between sites can be assumed with good conﬁdence, we used the GBLOCKS
program [31]. It has been shown to give alignments that are almost independent
ˆ
to the diﬀerent options of CLUSTALAW.
We retained for tree construction only
the alignments having conserved at least twice more sites than species. For each
family, we computed two trees: one using PHYML [32], a Maximum Likelihood
(ML) method, and one using BIONJ [33] an implementation of the NeighbourJoining (NJ) algorithm. For both methods, we used the Jones-Taylor-Thorton
(JTT) model of amino acid substitution [34]. In the case of BIONJ trees, the
distances were computed using PROTDIST, from the PHYLIP package [35].
Heterogeneities between sites were estimated under a gamma law based model
of substitution, and the computation of the alpha parameter was carried out
by PUZZLE [36]. All trees were bootstrapped (1000 replicates) using programs
SEQBOOT and CONSENSE from PHYLIP.
2.3

Final Selection of Families

In order to reduce the impact of inter-domain lateral transfers, we applied the
same criteria as in [16], i.e. we screened the trees where bacteria were not monophyletic and we removed these families from the data set or corrected them
by removing the transferred sequences from the alignment when it was evident.
At last, we ended with 122 trees suitable for super-tree construction.
2.4

Super-tree Computation

Trees chosen for the super-tree computation were coded into a binary matrix
using the MRP coding scheme [22],[23]. Before we applied this method to complete genomes, it has been used to infer a phylogeny of Eutheria [37]. Each tree
obtained for a set of species from a single gene family is coded into a binary
matrix of informative sites with respect to bootstrap values as shown in Fig. 1.
The matrices obtained are concatenated into a super-matrix in which species
absent from a gene family are encoded as unknown state. The super-tree is calculated on the super-matrix using program PAUP* [38] with all default options.
1000 bootstrap replicates are performed on the supermatrix with SEQBOOT
and CONSENSE.

Results

The two super-trees we obtain are quite similar regarding to their topology
(Fig. 2 and 3). In both of them, the great bacterial divisions and subdivisions
are found to be monophyletic, as well as the Euryarcheota. The lack of resolution of the archaeal part of the tree is due to the low number of genes available
for these species. As expected, the bacterial part presents higher bootstrap values and appears thus more resolved, especially with the BIONJ-based trees.

positives and Spirochetes are strongly supported (bootstrap ≥ 80%). The monophyly of low G+C Gram positives is also strongly supported in the BIONJ-based
super-tree, but has a weaker support in the PHYML-based super-tree. As in our
ˆ
previous study [24], we ﬁnd that D.Aradiodurans
is grouped with the high G+C
ˆ
Gram positives. Also, C.Atepidum is grouped with the Chlamidiales. Like in
the rRNA trees, hyperthermophilic bacteria are located at a basal position, this
with a strong support. This is an important diﬀerence from our previous results,
where this position was occupied by Spirochetes [24]. Here, the Spirochetes are
located much deeper in the two super-trees, and this positioning is not supported The remaining parts of the super-trees, and particularly the deep nodes, is
not supported. This diﬃculty of resolving deep branches may be related to the
increasing probability of horizontal transfers, hidden paralogies and long branch
artifacts with separation time in the individual gene trees.

Discussion – Conclusion

Although the deep nodes have low support, the level of resolution of the supertree is in strong disagreement with the ”genome space” vision of the prokaryotic
world predicting a ”star phylogeny” [13]. One could argue that grouping of species in the super-tree would only reﬂect the frequency of gene exchanges between
these species. This interpretation can be excluded since the super-tree method
would then not be expected to give a tree topology radically diﬀerent from gene-

content based trees [18],[19],[21] which are predicted to be very sensitive to this
problem. It is worth to insist on the fact that a particularly stringent selection of
protein families was exercised for building the supertree. In particular, a phylogenetic deﬁnition of orthology rather than a deﬁnition based on reciprocal best

BLAST hits - as is often the case for practical reasons - was used. Thus, all
gene trees where a species was represented more than once were excluded from
analysis. This selection allowed to make absolutely no a priori assumption on
the topology of the trees, except for the monophyly of bacteria, and to reduce
the probability of taking hidden paralogies into account. The phylogeny of Proteobacteria appears is well resolved at this level and is in agreement with the
rRNA phylogeny and protein-based works (see[39] for review). Their monophyly
(including H.pylori and C.jejunii) is well supported and this last result is particularly valuable because it has rarely been found with genome-tree methods
[15],[19],[21]. Equally interesting is the low (or lack of) support for clustering
the two hyperthermophilic bacteria, A.aeolicus and T.maritima. Indeed, since
proteins of hyperthermophilic bacteria and archaea have been shown to possess
a very peculiar amino acid composition [40], it is possible that the grouping
of A.aeolicus and T.maritima is linked to a systematic artifact present in the
majority of our gene trees. Also, the positioning of these organisms in a basal
part of the tree brings us back to a more traditional view of the bacterial world.
An explanation for that change could be the presence of horizontally transferred genes in our original data set. Here, due to the fact we had to increase the
number of species represented in each family, we mechanically decreased the
number of families represented in each species. Therefore, we may have removed
horizontally transferred genes responsible for the basal position of Spirochetes,
as it was done in [16]. The monophyly of low G+C Gram-positives (including
Bacillus and Mycoplasma) on one side, and of high G+C Gram-positives on the
other side is supported in both super-trees. On the other hand, Gram-positive
bacteria are polyphyletic, suggesting that two independent losses of the external
membrane occurred in the high- and low G+C phyla. The signiﬁcant support
for the position of D.radiodurans is very striking since this organism is usually
considered to have a much more basal position among bacteria [1]. This bacterium was already placed there in our previous study [24] and [16] also gives
strong support to this position. On the other hand, it remains possible that this
position is due to the high G+C content of the genome of Deinococcus. Indeed,
D.radiodurans is a close relative of Thermus aquaticus, which is a Gram-negative
thermophilic bacterium. Though D.radiodurans is positive to the Gram coloration, it has been shown to possess an external membrane unlike Gram-positives.
Thus, although this position seems supported, it still needs to be conﬁrmed, in
particular by the addition of Thermus in the super-tree.
