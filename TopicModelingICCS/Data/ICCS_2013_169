Abstract
The objective is to understand, for any two-phase ﬂow situation, the instantaneous spatiotemporal nature of the domain-ofdependence. The focal setting is generally nonlinear and heterogeneous, compressible two-phase ﬂow and transport in porous
media. The analytical approach develops a sequence of approximations that ultimately recast the general conservation equations into an inﬁnite-dimensional Newton process. Within this process, the spatiotemporal evolution is dictated by linear differential equations that are easily analyzed. We develop sharp conservative estimates for the support of instantaneous changes
to ﬂow and transport variables. Several computational examples are used to illustrate the analytical results.
Keywords: Locality, Nonlinear, Porous Media;

1. Introduction
Nonlinearity and complexity are inherent features in all aspects of the Earth and the Environment. There is a
distinct nonlinear stiﬀness that arises when a process couples various physics that are characterized by diﬀerent
spatiotemporal scales. Speciﬁcally, the superposition of physics of disparate characteristic scales brings about a
curse of dimensionality. On the one hand, the notion of resolution is limited by the most localized characteristic
scale, whereas on the other, the extent of the problem domain is dictated by the most global scale. There is
further complexity in such multiscale coupling. The spread of scales and their locality are themselves dynamic,
evolving in a nonlinearly complex manner. These aspects of multiscale complexity pose timely challenges in
modern forward and inverse modelling methods.
There is no fundamental and universally applicable characterization of the instantaneous spatiotemporal locality of general multiphase ﬂow and transport problems in three-dimensions. Rather, in the literature, there are
two approaches to the study of locality. The ﬁrst approach tackles the general complex problem while devising
ad hoc estimates. Examples of this occur in the context of adaptive numerical simulation methods that a attempt
to exploit locality about travelling waves; for example [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In the other approach, limiting cases of
idealized problems are studied using exact analytical methods; see for example [6, 7].
This work derives exact analytic results for a general canonical form for multiphase ﬂow and transport while
admitting general heterogeneity and nonlinearity.

1.1. Problem setting
The focus of this work is on the general form of the governing equations for transient two-phase ﬂow in
porous media. Following the conventions presented in Appendix A, denote the pressure unknown as, p (x, t) ∈
C2 (D × R+ ). Similarly, the transport unknown is labeled as, s (x, t) ∈ D × R+ . The two mass conservation
governing equations follow the canonical form,
∂ (1,2)
(x, p, s) − ∇ k(1,2) (x, p, s) ∇p + w(1,2) (x, t) = 0
a
∂t
k(1,2) ∇p = 0, x ∈ ∂D, t ≥ 0,
(p, s) = (pinit , sinit ) , x ∈ D, t = 0,

R(1,2) (p (x, t) , s (x, t)) =

(1)
(2)
(3)

where R(1) and R(2) are the general nonlinear residual operators for ﬂow and transport respectively. The accumulation, a(1,2) , incorporates a generally heterogeneous porosity and general density dependencies. The mobility
functions, k(1,2) , incorporate a spatially varying permeability tensor and a dynamic mobility dependency. The
net source terms are denoted as w(1,2) , and they may be spatially and temporally variable. Finally, the auxiliary
conditions in Equation 1 prescribe a no ﬂow boundary condition and compatible initial conditions.
1.2. Objectives
The objective is to characterize the instantaneous spatiotemporal support of the unknown ﬂow and transport
variables. In particular, at any given instant in time, t ≥ 0, suppose that we are informed of the present states of
the system; p (x ∈ D, t) and s (x ∈ D, t). In what parts of the spatial domain will the state experience change over
an inﬁnitesimal time-step, > 0?
Denoting the instantaneous changes in state as δ p = p (x, t + ) − p (x, t) and δ s = s (x, t + ) − s (x, t), the
questions are answered by characterizing the sets, ΩP = supp δ p and ΩS = supp (δ s ). Equations 1 are coupled,
time-dependent, and generally nonlinear Partial Diﬀerential Equations (PDE) that are of mixed order in space.
There is no analytical solution at any given instant for this general case [8]. The objective of this work is to
analytically derive sharp estimates δˆ p,s such that, δˆ p,s ≥ δ p,s , and subsequently, supp δˆ p,s ⊇ Ω p,s .
1.3. Outline
In the following section, we proceed by deriving a sequence of related problems that successively cast the
problem as one of determining the support of solution to linear, second- and ﬁrst-order diﬀerential equations. This
is accomplished by ﬁrst introducing a sequential solution formulation that allows for the iterative approximation of
the dynamic states while treating ﬂow and transport independently. Next, the problem is recast into a semidiscrete
implicit form. In this form, the solutions provide the instantaneous changes in state. Finally, inﬁnite-dimensional
quasilinearization processes are applied onto the semidiscrete equations, producing the instantaneous state updates
as the superposition of a sequence of solutions to linear diﬀerential equations. We analyze these diﬀerential forms
for ﬂow and transport independently in sections 3 and 4, thereby characterizing suitable estimates δˆ p,s . Finally,
this is followed by computational examples and a discussion.
2. Recasting the formulation
2.1. Estimates using decoupled ﬂow and transport
The three nonlinear functional terms appearing in the governing equations (accumulation, mobility, and net
sources) are generally functions of both state variables. This fact leads to the nonlinear coupling between the ﬂow,
R(1) , and transport, R(2) , equations.
An approximation to the solution of the coupled system can be obtained by sequentially isolating the pressure
and transport components (see for example. [9]). This is accomplished by successively freezing the functional
dependencies; for example a (p, S ) is considered as a (x, p; s), with a frozen saturation state, s, that becomes a
parameter rather than a variable. In one iteration of this strategy, transport is frozen and a decoupled pressure
is obtained. The new pressure is frozen and an updated transport variable is obtained. The sequential strategy
continues with such iterations until convergence.

The general form of the ﬂow equation with frozen transport terms is,

∇p = 0, x ∈ ∂D, t ≥ 0,
p = pinit , x ∈ D, t = 0.

s = sinit , x ∈ D, t = 0.

R(2) (s (x, t)) =

(9)

By considering general solutions to Equations 4 and 7, we can relate to the solution of the coupled system.
2.2. The instantaneous form
In related analytical approaches, time-dependence is often treated by a time-domain transform such as the
Laplace transform (see for example [10]). While such approaches recast the equations into steady forms in the
transformed domain, any insight gained needs to be translated to the physical domain through an inverse transform.
Closed-form inverse transforms to general nonlinear problems are seldom tractable. Since the current focus is on
the local, instantaneous nature of the evolution, a fully-implicit [9], semi-discrete form of the governing equations
is formed.
The semidiscrete form of Equation 4 becomes,
R(1) pn+1 (x) = A pn+1 − Δt ∇ K pn+1 ∇pn+1 + ΔtW x, tn+1 = 0,
∇pn+1 = 0, x ∈ ∂D,

(10)
(11)

p = pinit .
0

(12)

Over the nth timestep, t = (n + 1) Δt, the solution of the operator equation is the pressure distribution snapshot
pn (x), which is assumed to be unique. The approximation is accurate in the instantaneous limit, Δt → 0, and it is
a steady governing form for the instantaneous state.
Similarly, the semidiscrete transport equation is,
R(2) sn+1 (x) = A sn+1 − Δt ∇F sn+1 + ΔtW x, tn+1 = 0,

(13)

F sn+1 = 0, x ∈ ∂D,

(14)

s = sinit .

While Equations 10 and 13 are steady PDE, they remain generally nonlinear. Without further specialization
to speciﬁc nonlinear forms, or to asymptotic subcases (e.g. [11]), it is not possible to directly recast the problem
into an equivalent linear one. Instead, in this work, the exact, fully nonlinear form is linearized indirectly using an
inﬁnite-dimensional form of a classic result: Newton’s Method [12].
2.3. Inﬁnite-dimensional forms for instantaneous state updates
For a general nonlinear residual, R un+1 ; Δt, un = 0, Newton’s iterative solution method produces a sequence
ν

of iterates un+1 , ν = 0, 1, . . ., that ultimately converge to the solution; i.e. un+1

ν

→ un+l , as ν → ∞. The

ν=0

sequence starts with the initial guess, un+1
= un . For subsequent iterations, ν = 1, . . ., the sequence is deﬁned

In this equation, the operator derivative R (a) (b) is the Frechet derivative evaluated at function a and applied onto
function b. In the case of algebraic operators, the Frechet derivative is a nonlinear Jacobian matrix evaluated at
the vector a and multiplying the vector b.

It is the sum of a set of analytical solutions to linear Boundary Value Problems (BVP).
2.3.1. The semilinear ﬂow problem
In the case of ﬂow, we assume that the operator equation, R(1) pn+1 (x) , is Frechet diﬀerentiable. A suﬃcient
condition for this is that the three coeﬃcient functions, A, K, and W all be diﬀerentiable with respect to pn+1 . The
Frechet derivative of the semidiscrete ﬂow residual evaluated at p, and applied onto function δ p is,
R (p) δ p = A (p) δ p − Δt ∇2 K (p) δ p .

(18)

Notice that the Frechet derivative is linear in δ and nonlinear in p. This is why Frechet diﬀerentiation is often
referred to as a quasilinearization. Applying this result, each Newton step, δν , is obtained by solving the quasilinearized operator equation,

2.3.2. The semilinear transport problem
Similar to the development for ﬂow, the Frechet derivative of the transport operator equation R(2) sn+1 (x)
evaluated at s, and applied onto function δ s is,
R (s) (δ s ) = A (s) δ s − Δt ∇ F (s) δ s .

(22)

The Frechet derivative is a ﬁrst-order linear diﬀerential equation in δ s . Next, we applying this result into the

The screening coeﬃcient α is generally positive
√ since the derivative of the accumulation with respect to pressure is physically always positive. Let λ = inf x∈D α (x) ∈ R+ , and suppose that w (x) is a solution to,

It then directly follows that |w (x)| ≥ |y (x)| for x ∈ D. Equation 28 is now in the form of the screened Poisson

(34)

In this paper, we will consider the domain to be the ball of radius l centered at the origin; B (0, l) = {x : |x − 0| < l}.
We are concerned with the inﬂuence of compactly supported perturbations in the residual; that is, we consider
cases where supp β is compact and is contained in D. The question we are trying to answer can now be rephrased
as that of determining supp w. We will obtain a conservative sharp estimate of the support by obtaining an estimate
wˆ such that |wˆ (x)| ≥ |w (x)|, and subsequently, supp wˆ ⊇ supp w ⊇ D.
Letting x ∈ D\ supp (β), an estimate is easily obtained as follows:
G (x, y) β (y) dy

|w (x)| =

Next, we analytically obtain such estimates for one dimension. Closed form estimates are readily obtained for
multiple dimensions using the same process.
3.1. One-dimensional problems
In one-dimension we will treat the domain as the interval D = [0, L] with boundary ∂D = {0, L}. Assuming
that x, y ∈ D, the Green’s function for problem 28 is simply,

(39)

In this work, we are concerned with the eﬀects of a nontrivial residual. Suppose that the residual β (x) is a bump
function with compact support Ω = supp β (x) = [L1 , L2 ] ⊂ D. Then for x ∈ Ω, the residual is nonzero, and for
x ∈ D\Ω it is zero-valued. Subsequently, estimate (35) allows us to obtain a sharp upperbound on the magnitude
of the response w (x) to the residual perturbation with compact support. Performing the simple integrals in the
estimates (35), we conclude,

values of the screening parameter.

To illustrate the eﬃcacy of the estimate above, we consider a speciﬁc case. In this example, the domain is of
length L = 1, and the screening coeﬃcient is considered uniform. We consider various values for the screening
parameter; λ2 = 10, 100, and 1000. The residual at the current iteration is modeled by the bump function,
β (x) = exp −

which has a compact support Ω = [0.4, 0.6]. Figure 1 shows the estimates obtained by an accurate ﬁnite diﬀerence
approximation and by the proposed method for various values of the screening parameter. Clearly the proposed
estimates are conservative and in this example supp wnumerical ⊆ supp wanalytical .

The semilinear equation for the transport variable Newton iterate is now simply,

(48)

4.1. Example in one-dimension
In one-dimension we will treat the domain as the interval D = [0, L] with boundary ∂D = {0, L}. Assuming
that x, y ∈ D, the general solution has the form,

5. Further work
The approach presented in this article can be applied to two and three dimensions, providing sharp conservative estimates of the support of instantaneous spatiotemporal change in two-phase ﬂow and transport phenomena.
In this work, one-dimensional results are derived to illustrate the approach. Moreover, this work leads to further
analysis into how the spatiotemporal support grows with further inﬁnite-dimensional iterations to convergence.
Applications of this approach are anticipated in areas such as the characterization of nonlinear iteration convergence rates for implicit simulation methods, spatially adaptive numerical methods and solvers, and in local
time-stepping.

Appendix A. Conventions and preliminaries
Deﬁne the open, bounded spatial domain D ⊂ R3 and time t ∈ R+ . We use discrete counterparts to the spatial
and temporal domains. Speciﬁcally, for any integer h > 0 we denote the corresponding discrete spatial domain
as Dh = {xi ∈ D : i = 0, 1, . . . , h}. A discrete temporal domain is deﬁned by the set of times {tn ≥ 0 : n = 0, 1, . . .},
where a time-step is written as Δtn = tn+1 − tn .
Lower case letters are used to denote function mappings. For instance, the smooth twice diﬀerentiable function
p (x, t) ∈ C2 (D × R+ ) denotes a transient pressure distribution deﬁned over the spatial domain x ∈ D. Another
example is the set of functions representing the semidiscrete pressure distributions for various discrete times;
{pn (x) : n = 0, 1, . . . , and x ∈ D}. The spatial support of a function, p (x ∈ D → R), is denoted as supp (p) and is
deﬁned as the set ω = {x ∈ D : p (x) 0}. Outside of its support, a function is identically zero; p y ∈ R3 \ω = 0.
The function p is said to be compactly supported if supp (p) is a compact set.
Vector quantities are denoted by a capital letter and matrices appear in boldface. A subscript indicates that the
vector represents quantities that are discretized over space, whereas a superscript denotes a temporally discrete
vector. For instance the vector function Ph (t) : R+ → Rh denotes the spatially semidiscrete pressure, and the
vector Pnh ∈ Rh denotes a fully-discrete pressure state on the domain Dh at time-step n.
Formally, operators are mappings from one space onto another. We use the term inﬁnite-dimensional operator to refer to mappings from one space of functions onto another space of functions; e.g. the divergence
operator acting on a smooth function. Finite-dimensional operators on the other hand, are mappings from one
ﬁnite-dimensional vector space on to another; e.g. matrix-vector multiplication. While all functions are formally
operators, in this work we reserve the term operator to imply that the domain or the range involve spaces more
complex than the real numbers. To emphasize the distinction in each context, operators are italicized. For example, the inﬁnite-dimensional operator F (t) (p (x)) = k (t) ∇p (x) is evaluated at point t and is applied onto function
p (x), and is a mapping from the space of functions C2 (D) onto the space of vector functions C (D)3 . An example
of a ﬁnite dimensional operator of order h > 0 is Fh (t) Ph = K (t) ∇h Ph , which is an approximation of F with
level of reﬁnement h.
Consider a general inﬁnite dimensional operator, R : Ω → Y, that maps from a convex domain Ω ⊂ X of a
Banach space X onto a Banach space Y. The operator may be Frechet diﬀerentiable. A practical method to obtain
the Frechet derivative, R (h) (v), evaluated at h ∈ X and applied to v ∈ X, is to set some h ∈ X, and a scalar , and
from the deﬁnition of a Frechet derivative, we have,
R (v) (h) = lim
