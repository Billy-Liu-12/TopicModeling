Abstract. The most important problem on seal imprint verification is to extract
the imprint feature, which is independent upon varying conditions. This paper
proposes a new method to extract the feature of seal imprint using the doubledensity dual-tree DWT due to its good directional selectivity, approximate shift
invariance and computational efficiency properties. 16 different directions
information is obtained as a seal imprint image transforms by using doubledensity dual-tree DWT. Experimental results show that their directional
behaviors are much different, although the frequency distributions of true seals
are similar to false seals’. This method is stable and computationally efficient
for seal imprint.
Keywords: Seal imprint verification, the double-density dual-tree DWT,
feature extraction.

1 Introduction
Seal imprint has been commonly used for personal confirmation in the Oriental
countries. Seal imprint verification for document validation is sticking point.
Therefore, it is highly desirable that large numbers of seal imprint are verified
automatically, speedily and reliably. However, seal imprint verification is a very
difficult problem [1]. Its difficulty comes from two aspects [2]:
(1) The various stamping conditions may affect the quality of the seal imprint
images;
(2) The forgery seal imprint may be very similar to the original seal imprint.
Therefore, it is important to find separate and efficient features of seal imprint.
Over the past years, many studies have been focused on extracting the impression
feature in frequency domain. Gabor filters [3] have been used in texture analysis due
to their good directional selectivity in different frequency scales. Serkan el. [4]
proposed a new feature extraction method utilizing dual tree complex wavelet
transform (DT-CWT).
In the conventional DWT domain, it is difficult to achieve perfect reconstruction
and equal frequency responses. In addition, directional selectivity is poor in DWT

domain. In 2004, Selesnick [5] proposed the double-density dual-tree DWT, which
possess the properties of the double-density DWT as well as the DT-CWT.
In this paper, the double-density dual-tree DWT is employed for decomposing a
seal imprint image into the bandpass sub-images that are strongly oriented at 16
different angles. As higher directional selectivity is obtained, the dominant frequency
channel and orientation of the pattern are detected with a higher precision [5].
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the double-density dual-tree DWT,
its dual-tree filters, and its properties are introduced. The projection operators of
bandpass subimages in the double-density dual-tree DWT are presented in Section 3.
The experimental results are shown in Section 4, followed by the conclusions drawn in
Section 5.

2 The Double-Density Dual-Tree DWT Theory
2.1 The Dual-Tree CWT
In order to have directional selectivity with Mallat’s efficient separable, it is
necessary to use complex coefficient filters. Filters are chosen to be linear phase so
that odd-length highpass filters have even symmetry and the even-length highpass
filters have odd symmetry about their midpoints [7]. Then, the DT CWT comprises
two trees of real filters, A and B, which produce the real and imaginary parts of the
complex coefficients. Fig.1 shows the complete 2-D DT CWT structure over 2
levels.
Each level of the trees produces 6 complex-valued bandpass subimages {D(n,m) ,
n=1,……,6}(where m represents the scale.) as well as two lowpass subimages A(1,m)
and A(2,m) on which sub-sequent stages iterate [4]. {D(n,m) , n=1,……,6} are strongly
oriented at 15, 45, 75, -15, -45, -75 degrees.
The results of two-level decomposition of the DT CWT are shown in Fig. 2. It is
seen that image subbands from six orientations are obtained as shown above, while
the seal impression image at each level of decomposition contains two parts: the real
parts and the imaginary parts. There are relative 8 image subbands at each level.
Therefore, there are 12 (6×2) image highpass subbands at each level, each of which
are strongly oriented at distinct angles.
2.2 The Double-Density Dual-Tree DWT
The design of dual-tree filters is addressed in [6], through an approximate Hilbert pair
formulation for the ‘dual’ wavelets. Selesnick [5] also proposed the double-density
DWT and combined both frame approaches. The double-density complex DWT is
based on two scaling functions and four distinct wavelets, each of which is
specifically designed such that the two wavelets of the first pair are offset from one
other by one half, and the other pair of wavelets form an approximate Hilbert
transform pair [4].

The structure of the filter banks corresponding to the double-density complex
DWT consists of two oversampled iterated filter banks operating in parallel on the
same input data. The double-density DT CWT is shown in Fig.3 [6]. We see that
each tree produces 9 subbands, 8 (hi1 hi2 hi3 hi4 hi5 hi6 hi7 hi8)
of which are strongly oriented at 8 different angles. Then, 16 (8×2) image
subbands (Tree A and Tree B) are corresponding to 16 different angles at each
level.
Fig.4 is the second-level decomposition results of the double-density dual-tree
DWT.

Here we obtain image subbands from 16 orientations as in the previous case, but the
seal imprint image at each level of decomposition contains two parts (the real parts
and the imaginary parts, each which is the relative 18 sub-images at each level.)

Therefore, there are 36 sub-images at each level containing 32 high-frequency
subbands, some of which are the relative 16 different angles at each level. Since
higher directional selectivity is obtained, the dominant, frequency channel and
orientation of the pattern is detected with a higher precision.

3 The Projections of High-Frequency Subbands
The identification of seal imprint is more attention to detail information because the
overall profile of seal imprint is very similar. We proposed a method utilizing the
shift invariant properties and greater directional selectivity of the double-density
dual-tree DWT. To reduce the computational complexity, and get most effective
feature, the feature extraction of seal imprint utilize the projection operators of highfrequency subbands in the double-density dual-tree DWT. The horizontal direction
projections of the subbands of six different angles as the example are demonstrated
in Fig.5.

Fig. 6. Feature extraction of projected vectors

To reduce the computational complexity, we search for three maximum and three
minimum values, whose locations are regarded as the features of seal imprint in the

1042

projected vectors of high-frequency subbands. Aforementioned process is shown in
Fig.6.There are 32 high-frequency subbands which are the relative 6×32 values of the
features of the seal imprint at each level. The detailed process of feature extraction is
illustrated in Fig.7.
As shown in Fig.4, we can get 16 different directions information of seal imprint
image by the vertical/horizontal projection of the 32 high-frequency subbands.

4 Experiment Result
In our experiment, the feature extraction of seal imprint is in the second level of
double-density dual-tree DWT. The seal imprint images are of size 256×256.The
following images are the three true seal imprints and their corresponding false seal
imprints.
In Fig.8, we see that false seals are similar to the given true seals too much. The
performance of this method has been investigated using a database containing
100×3 seal imprint images (three groups are A, B and C respectively, each contains
50 true seals and 50 false seals.), and promising results have been obtained. The
match ratio of the features is used for the classification algorithm. To reduce FAR
(False Acceptance Rate, set the threshold of 46% matching ratio for B-Group and
A-Group, and 50% matching ratio for C-Group. The experimental results are shown
in Table 1.

In Table 1, we can see that recognition rates of rotundity-seals (A) and ellipse-seals
(B) are more high than square -seals’ (C). As rotundity-seals (A) and ellipse-seals (B)
possess more salient features of direction, their features are separated highly in
comparison with square -seals’.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we proposed a feature extraction method of seal imprint based on the
double-density dual-tree DWT. Through the double-density dual-tree DWT of seal
imprint images, 16 different directions information is obtained. Although the
frequency distributions of true seals are similar to false seals’, their directional
behaviors are much different. The method is stable and computationally efficient. The

experimental results demonstrate that the features which have directional selectivity
properties extracted by this method are appropriate for verification of similar
structure.
