Abstract. IEEE 802.15.3 High-rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)
have been developed to communicate with devices within 10m at high speed. A
mesh network made up of a parent piconet and several child piconets can support
multi-hop communications. In this paper, we propose an efficient Channel Time
Allocation (CTA) method and routing algorithm for multi-hop communications
in IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN mesh networks. The proposed CTA allocation method allows sufficient CTA allocation for the relay PNCs. The proposed
routing algorithm is tree-based, and the routing tables of parent PNCs and child
PNCs are created by efficient device discovery process to find the shortest paths
via parent PNCs or subordinate child PNCs. We evaluate the performance of the
proposed algorithms via simulations. The proposed algorithms are shown to extend the communication range by multi-hop exchange of packets and to provide
sufficient Channel Time Allocations (CTAs) for parent and child PNCs.
Keywords: IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN, multi-hop, mesh network, routing.

1 Introduction
Recently, a lot of personal devices (DEVs) have emerged, and they are often required to
interact wirelessly to make information accessible and to exchange data without physical cables. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) can interconnect DEVs located
around person’s comfortable workspace wirelessly. WPAN is a developing communication technology to allow short-range wireless ad-hoc connectivity among portable
consumer electronics and communication DEVs. Although Bluetooth has introduced
as the first WPAN technology [1], it provides the data rate of about 1Mbps, which is
limited in the sense it is hard to support high-rate or real-time multimedia traffic [2].
A new high-rate WPAN standard has been developed by IEEE 802.15.3 task group
(TG) [3]. The target applications of the high-rate WPAN can be divided into two categories. The first one is multi-megabyte file transfer such as images and mp3 files. The
second one is distribution of real-time video and high-quality audio. IEEE 802.15.3
This research was supported by the Ministry of Information and Communication, Korea, under
the ITRC IITA-2006-(C1090-0603-0046) and by grant No.R01-2006-000-10402-0 from the
Basic Research Program Korea Science and Engineering Foundation of Ministry of Science &
Technology. Dr. Tae-Jin Lee is the corresponding author.

high-rate WPAN [3] operates in the unlicensed 2.4GHz ISM band, and supports the
data rate of up to 55Mbps and ad-hoc mode allowing a number of DEVs to communicate with one another in a piconet. A piconet in IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN consists
of several DEVs and one Piconet Coordinator (PNC). If a DEV needs channel time on
a regular basis, it asks the PNC for isochronous channel time. A mesh network can be
formed by connecting piconets to extend coverage and communication area. As a result,
it enhances network reliability and improves network throughput [4]. A mesh network
in IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN consists of a parent piconet and its child piconets.
The child PNC of a child piconet is a member of the parent piconet and it also operates
as the PNC in the child piconet. A new child piconet is constructed under an established
piconet, and the established piconet then becomes the parent piconet. So a child piconet
is dependent on the parent piconet [5] and requires channel time allocation to the parent
piconet and is synchronized with the parent piconet’s timing.
In the current IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN specification, efficient routing algorithms for multi-hop mesh networks are not defined and only basic frame structure for
the formation of a single channel mesh network is defined. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose an efficient WPAN mesh network routing algorithm, Parent PNCs and Child
PNCs, for multi-hop communications and evaluate its performance. Our proposed mesh
network routing algorithm is a tree-based routing algorithm. The routing tables of parent PNCs and child PNCs are created by efficient device discovery process to find the
shortest paths via parent PNCs or subordinate child PNCs. And, we also propose CTA
allocation mechanism for time division of superframes. We analyze device discovery
time and conduct simulations to evaluate its performance. Simulation results validate
the desired features of the proposed routing algorithms for multi-hop communications.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the
IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN Media Access Control (MAC) and mesh networks. In
Section 3, we describe our proposed channel time allocation and routing for WPAN
mesh networks. Section 4 provides the performance analysis of the proposed algorithm
for multi-hop communications. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 IEEE 802.15.3 High-Rate WPAN MAC and Mesh Network
An IEEE 802.15.3 piconet consists of a PNC and more than one DEV. A piconet is
managed by the PNC, and supports ad-hoc peer-to-peer connection. The PNC provides
the basic timing for the piconet with beacons and it allows independent DEVs to communicate one another. The channel time allocation for data transmission in a piconet is
given in the superframes. Each superframe begins with a beacon, and Contention Access Preiod (CAP), and Channel Time Allocation Period (CTAP) follow. The beacon
is used to set the timing synchronization and to communicate management information for the piconet, and it is generated and broadcast by the PNC. The CAP is used
to exchange association request and response command, channel time request and response command, and asynchronous data. During the CAP, DEVs try to access the
channel in a distributed fashion using Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA). The CTAP is composed of channel time allocations (CTAs), and
management CTAs (MCTAs), which allows TDMA-like medium access.

Fig. 1. Parent piconet and child piconet superframe relationship

IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN allows a DEV of a piconet to request the formation
of a subsidiary piconet. The original piconet is referred to as the parent piconet and the
subsidiary piconet is referred to as a child or a neighbor piconet [6]. We call a mesh
network as a set of piconets consisting of a parent piconet and its child piconets. Fig. 1
illustrates the relationship between the superframe of the parent piconet and that of the
child piconet. The None period denotes that there is no peer-to-peer communications
during beacon times. The C-P period denotes communications between a child PNC
and a DEV of the parent PNC or the PNC of the parent, and the C-C period denotes
communications between child piconet DEV and DEV, or child piconet PNC and DEV.
A child PNC is a member of the parent piconet and thus it can exchange data with any
DEV in the parent piconet. A parent piconet and its child piconets operate under the
same frequency channel. A mesh network can be formed for multi-hop communications
with the aid of child PNCs and the parent PNC. How to form a WPAN mesh networks
[7] and to route packets in the network are some of the most important issues. We focus
on efficient routing of WPAN mesh networks.

3 Proposed Channel Time Allocation and Routing for WPAN
Mesh Networks
A mesh network made up of a parent piconet and its child piconets incurs multi-hop
communications. Therefore, we need efficient CTA allocation method and routing algorithm for multi-hop communications among DEVs. In this section, we present a mechanism for DEV discovery to create routing tables. Then we present our proposed a CTA
allocation method and a routing algorithm. We assume that the PNC of a parent piconet
and those of child piconets know the information on the DEVs of the parent piconet and
the child piconets, respectively.
3.1 Device Discovery to Form Routing Tables
In this section, we present a method to create routing table. Fig. 2 shows a mesh network
example with two levels (L) and routing tables of a parent piconet and child piconets.
The parent piconet and child piconets use distinct PNIDs. The parent piconet uses PNID
0 when L = 0. The number of child piconets when L = 1 is two and the child piconets
use PNID 1 and 2. The number of child piconets when L = 2 are three and the child

460

S.-B. Jung et al.

piconets use PNID 3, 4, and 5. The parent piconet has to know all the PNIDs of the
child piconets and the topology under the PNC to make a routing table. When a child
piconet is formed, the PNC of the child piconet informs its member DEV Identifiers
(DEVIDs) and PNID to its parent. The PNC that receives the descendents information pass it all the way up to the root parent PNC (PNC with PNID 0), and the PNC
then creates the routing table. In this way, a tree-shape PNC hierarchy is constructed
(see Fig. 3). Therefore, the root parent piconet can have all the PNIDs. Child piconets
only have to know PNIDs of its subordinate child piconets.
Bandwidth allocation for the parent piconet and its child piconets has been present in
[7]. To explain the DEV discovery for routing table formation and the CTA allocation
for a DEV or PNC, we define the following notations:

We can calculate the available CTA size of child piconets in level i, TiC size by Eq. (1).
The TiC size consists of a beacon time and a CAP, and the basic CTAs for the DEVs. Since
mi child piconets request beacon time, CAPs, and CTA allocation remainder (Ri+1
CTA1 ) for
child piconets for the next level i+1,and, ni DEVs in level i are assigned TCTA ,
TiC size = (TB + TCAP + Ri+1
CTA1 ) × mi + (TCTA × ni ),

i = 1, 2, · · · , L.

The T0S size consists of a beacon time and a CAP, and the basic CTAs for the parent
piconet DEVs and is computed as Eq. (2). We can calculate the available superframe
size for level i, TiS size by Eq. (3). The R1CTA1 is the CTA allocation remainder to one child
piconet for level 1.

T0S size = TB + TCAP + (TCTA × Np )

3.2 Proposed Channel Time Allocation Method and Routing Algorithm
The CTA allocation and routing algorithm have a great effect on efficient data transmission. In this section, we propose an efficient CTA allocation method and a routing algorithm. We assume that parent PNCs and child PNCs can support packet relay.
Source DEVs will generate a new packet for data transmission. If the parent PNC or
child PNCs receive the packet, they relay the packets. So CTAs of a superframe are allocated to source DEVs and the relaying PNCs. The parent PNC is located at the center
of data transmission. Consequently, the traffic of parent PNC often experience heavy
traffic. The proposed CTA allocation method allocates sufficient CTAs for the relay of
the parent PNC. We can calculate the available CTA of a DEV in piconets with PNID
0, C0D CTA1 by Eq. (6). The C0P CTA denotes available CTAs of its parent PNC in a parent

where Rmax is the maximum CTA ratio between a parent PNC and its child PNCs, and
B0CTA is the allocated bandwidth in the parent piconet with PNID 0 and Sn0 is the number
of source DEVs for PNID 0. And, Rn0 is the number of child piconets for PNID 0. The
child PNCs are the member of their parent piconet and RC PNC is the basic CTA ratio
the parent PNC and child PNCs. The RC PNC value is set to two. The 1 in Rn0 +1 denotes
the number of CTAs for the parent piconet and the 2 in 2 × r denotes the number of
CTAs for uplink and downlink relay.
We can calculate the available CTA of a DEV in child piconets with PNID j, CjD CTA1
by Eq. (9). The CjC CTA presents the available CTAs of child PNCs in child piconets with
PNID j and is computed as Eq. (10).

We then describe the proposed routing algorithm in the parent PNCs and the child
PNCs. The proposed routing algorithm is a tree-based routing algorithm as in Fig. 3,
which shows the tree hierarchy structure associated with Fig. 2. The routing tables of
parent PNCs and child PNCs are created by an efficient device discovery process to find
the shortest paths via parent PNCs or subordinate child PNCs as explained in Section
3.1. The pseudocode of the proposed routing algorithm is shown in Fig. 4. While parent
PNCs or child PNCs receive a packet, if there exists the PNID of a destination DEV in
the routing table, either parent PNC or child PNCs compare the destination PNID with
its own PNID. If the destination PNID is the same as its own PNID, the packet is sent
to the destination DEV. Otherwise, either parent PNCs or child PNCs send to the next

routing table, the packet is forwarded to the upper PNC. Because of the tree hierarchy,
a packet is destined to the proper destination DEV by the proposed routing mechanism.

4 Performance Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the proposed CTA allocation method and the routing
algorithm for multi-hop communications via simulations. The simulation parameters
are summarized in Table 1. The DEVs are assumed to be located uniformly in a square
area of 50m × 50m. The mesh network formation algorithm and the bandwidth allocation for the parent piconet and child piconets are adopted as in [7]. We use MPEG-4
traffic model for isochronous traffic and its data rate of is 4 Mbps. The length of a MAC
Service Data Unit (MSDU) is generated uniformly in 64 ∼ 2,032 bytes. The 802.15.3
protocol adds Short Interframe Space (SIFS) and guard time between individual CTAs
to keep transmissions in adjacent CTAs from colliding.

We analyze the performance of the CTA allocation method and the routing algorithm with respect to end-to-end delay, packet loss, and throughput. Fig. 5 presents the
end-to-end delay by the proposed CTA allocation method and the routing algorithm.
We compared end-to-end delays under various CTA ratio (r) and the number of sourcedestination (S-D) pairs. The end-to-end delay is about 0.54 second when r = 0 and the
number of S-D pairs = 30. The end-to-end delay is improved up to approximately 0.24
second when r = 3 and number of S-D pairs = 30. As r increases, the end-to-end delay is shown to be decreased since PNCs are allocated more CTAs for relaying traffic.
Fig. 6 presents the packet loss rate of the proposed algorithm. When the number of
S-D pairs increases, the packet loss rate increases up to about 3 ∼ 5%. We also analyze
the total throughput. Fig. 7 shows the throughput performance of the proposed CTA
allocation method and the routing algorithm. Total throughput increases as r and the
number of S-D pairs increase. When r is 3 and the number of S-D pairs is 30, the total
throughput becomes the maximum at about 3.4 Mbps.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed the CTA allocation method and routing algorithm for
multi-hop communications in IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate WPAN mesh networks. The
proposed CTA allocation method allocates sufficient CTAs for relay PNCs. The proposed routing algorithm is simple and tree-based, and the routing tables of parent
PNCs and child PNCs are created by an efficient device discovery process to find the
shortest paths via parent PNCs or subordinate child PNCs. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms via simulations. The end-to-end delay, the packet
loss rate, total throughput indicates desired characteristics. The proposed algorithms
are able to provide efficient multi-hop communications in IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN mesh
networks.
In the future we intend to include the effects of various CTA allocation schemes for
the relay PNCs and DEVs. Further, we are implementing and studying other features of
the routing algorithm and bandwidth allocation.
