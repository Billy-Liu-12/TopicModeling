Abstract. In this paper, a design for a low-power 512-bit synchronous
EEPROM with flash cells for passive UHF RFID tag chip is presented. Applied
are low-power schemes such as dual power supply voltage(VDD=1.5V and
VDDP=2.5V), clocked inverter sensing, voltage-up converter, IO interface, and
Dickson charge pump using schottky diode. An EEPROM is fabricated with the
0.25 EEPROM process. Simulation results show that power dissipations are
8.34 in the read cycle and 57.7 in the write cycle, respectively. The layout
size is 449.3 × 480.67 .

1 Introduction
RFID(Radio Frequency IDentification) is the technology to provide various services
communicating between things by collecting, storing, and revising the information
around these things through they installed RFID tags on item. RFID tags are classified
according to communication method, battery existence, and read/write[1]. They are
standardized by EPC global which sets EPC (Electronic Product Code). Currently,
Generation 2 of Class 1 is one of the widely selected standards. It has advantages in
terms of cost and area. This paper presented EEPROM design for a passive UHF
RFID tag chip.

2 Circuit Design
Fig. 1 is a block diagram of a 512-bit synchronous EEPROM. The memory cell array
is composed of flash cell[8]. The EEPROM has four operating modes : program,
erase, read, and stand-by. It is synchronously operated by clock. Write mode means

program and erase modes. Dual power supply voltage, VDD(1.5V) and VDDP(2.5V),
is used to reduce currents in read and write modes.

A clocked inverter sensing method[6] is applied to read data of EEPROM cell in
the read mode. And a current sensing circuit is used for the non-volatile memory[4].
This is not proper in the EEPROM design for RFID tag chips because the current
dissipation of the sensing circuit is large. Therefore, despite low speed, low-power
RD(Read Data) sense amplifier is used without a reference current biasing circuit.
DC-DC converter uses Dickson charge pump[5] to generate high voltage in the
write mode. VDDP power is used in the voltage-up converter, VPP control logic, and
charge pump circuits[8]. VREF_VPP is reference voltage required for the DC-DC
converter. VREF_VPP level is too high to generate it by using VDD, so a low-power
voltage-up converter is added to the DC-DC converter. The voltage-up converter
makes reference voltage double by using VDDP.

The voltage of RD_DO swings between VDD and VSS. The voltage of IO swings
between VDDP and VSS. If VDD voltage transfers to the IO, they induce short circuit
currents in other IO interface. So, level translator is newly applied to the IO interface.
Dickson charge pump generates high voltages, VPP and VPPL, in the write mode.
The lower the forward bias voltage of the diode is used, the lower current flows in
Dickson charge pump. For this reason, a schottky diode is used for the pump. Power
dissipations of the charge pump are 67.7 with PN diode and 57.7 with schottky
diode in the program mode. Approximately, the power dissipation with schottky diode
drops by 12% compared with PN diode.

3 Simulation Results
Fig. 3 shows timing diagrams of CLK signal from analog circuit, command control
signals, CKE, REb, OEb from logic circuit, and PRECHARGE, DLINE_LOADb and
SAENb from control logic circuit as shown in Fig. 1. When read command enters at a
rising edge, PCHARGE makes DLINE and BL precharge to VDD. WL is active after
BL is precharged. When a data is transferred to the BL, a valid data comes out of I/O
through the RD_DO within a half clock period with SAENb activated. Power
dissipation simulation results are 57.7 in the program mode, 42.3 in the erase
mode, and 8.34
in the read mode, respectively. Fig. 4 is a layout picture with
0.25 EEPROM process. Layout size is 449.3 × 480.67 .

4 Conclusions
The EEPROM is fabricated with the 0.25 EEPROM process. In this paper, to reduce
power dissipation in EEPROM, dual power supply voltage, VDD(1.5V) and
VDDP(2.5V), is used to reduce the currents in the read and write modes. Also sensing
method using clocked inverter in the read mode is applied. VREF_VPP is made by
using the voltage-up converter in the write cycle. Level translator is newly applied to
IO interface in order to reduce short circuit current. A schottky diode is used for lower
power dissipation in Dickson charge pump. Simulation result shows that the designed
EEPROM is suitable for UHF RFID Class 1 Generation 2 and the fabricated
EEPROM will be verified by measurement in near future.
