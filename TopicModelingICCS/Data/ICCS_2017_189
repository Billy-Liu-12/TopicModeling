frequent appearance in nature and industrial applications (like coolant systems, pipelines, chemical
reactors and so on).
There are a lot of investigations in the field of dynamics of multiphase flows which are carried out
by numerical modeling to date. Significant amount of papers are dedicated to the simulation of
dispersed medium by the Lagrange-Euler approach, for example, such researches can be found in [13], papers [1, 2] are dedicated to the low speed particulate flows, while [3] presents the high speed
processes of bubble formation. The description of numerical models utilized Euler-Euler approach can
be found in papers [4-6] focused on the description of vertical bubbly flows with complex phase-tophase force interaction. Numerical modeling of polydisperse flows are described, for example, in the
papers [7, 8]. There are comparisons of different numerical codes, both proprietary and open-source,
focused on the solution of multiphase flows, one of which can be found in [9].
Lately, the direct numerical simulation take place in the field of multiphase flows [10-13]. Still,
their applications are limited by simple problems, like motion of a diluted particle flow in a
rectangular channel without detailed flow resolution around particles [10], motion of a group of
deformable bubbles with tracking of free surface [11, 12] or motion of a few bubbles with detailed
resolution of a free surface and mass fluxes across the surface [13].
Detailed simulations of such flows are usually connected with the solution of multiple differential
equations and necessity of storing all flow variables, which implies a limitation on the usage of
numerical modeling due to limited resources of a single workstation. Therefore, construction of
massively parallel computational systems seems the only solution for that problem.
The systems with distributed memory were widely spread in the beginning due to the fact that
single workstation or node of the computational network could not hold significant amount of
memory, big enough to store all problem-dependent variables. Thus, the MPI technology, which deals
with interprocessor communications over the network, was the first one and historically it was
included in the most of the simulation packages. Utilization of OpenMP library, which works with
shared memory, became possible because of significant increase of memory capacity and number of
cores of each processor and now this approach to parallelization becoming popular (see, for example,
[14-16]).
Numerical investigations will be carried out with the help of the parallelization technique on the
shared memory systems and will utilize previously developed mathematical models of dynamics of
polydisperse medium [17], numerical algorithm of the solution of the governed equations and the code
developed on the basis of the model and the algorithm. Mathematical model is based on the EulerEuler approach of description of multiphase flows [18] and includes the model of polydisperse
bubbles, in the framework of that model N classes of bubbles are introduced, each class contains
conservation equations for mass and momentum. The model is supplemented by equations of k-ω-SST
turbulence model and source terms which describes the inter-phase interaction.
The present work is dedicated to the simulation of the polydisperse bubble flow in a column by the
means of the OpenMP parallelization technique of the solution algorithm. Test cases will be carried
out on the “SC Politechnichesky” and parallelization performance will be estimated.

2 Mathematical Model and Governing Equations
The mathematical model is an extension of the previously developed Euler-Euler model with
single-size bubbles [18]. Polydispersity is taken into account by MUSIG model [19, 20], in that model
total spectrum of bubbles is represented by piecewise-constant distribution by their sizes, bubbles of
the same size corresponds to the class i with total number of classes equals to N. Bubble breakup/coalescence models are omitted in the current work due to the low volumetric bubble concentration
used in the simulations. Since N classes are introduced then mass and momentum conservation
equations for dispersed and liquid phases will have the following form:

here R — bubble radius, μ, σ, k and λ — parameters of the shape of the distribution function.
Mathematical expectations in that distributions are taken equal to most probable bubble size, which
can be estimated from the problem set-up parameters or taken from the experimental data. The number
of classes N is usually in the range from 5 to 10 for particular problem, and selected on the criteria of
converged solution and invariance of the solution from N. This number was taken up to 30 in the
present paper for testing purposes and the estimation of parallelization effectiveness.

3 Numerical Scheme and Solution Algorithm
The numerical method is based on the finite-volume approach and unstructured grids with colocated storage of flow variables. Pressure and velocity are found in separate fashion by modified
phase coupled SIMPLE (PC-SIMPLE) algorithm. The modified PC-SIMPLE includes only carrier
fluid fluxes for pressure correction, since fluxes of dispersed phase are negligibly small due to low
density of gas phase. Such assumption makes additional constraint on the bubble volume fraction
which should not exceed 20% and is satisfied in the following simulations. A second order accuracy
over spatial coordinates provided by TVD schemes and iterative process is realized through the
implicit first-order pseudotime marching scheme. Elimination of the effect of mesh skewness is done
by the orthogonal correction in calculation of viscous fluxes and curvilinear gradient calculation
scheme. As a result of discretization, the systems of linear algebraic equation are constructed per each
variable which can be solved by any iterative technique. The conjugate gradient method with the
Cholesky preconditioner was used in PC-SIMPLE algorithm for pressure calculation, all other systems
were solved by Gauss-Zeidel method with successive over-relaxation.
One of the drivers for the work is to understand how the developed algorithm can be parallelized at
low cost. Thus, the process decomposition will be used instead of data decomposition. This means that
separate independent parts of algorithm will be selected and solved in parallel on the same mesh.
Implementation of such an algorithm requires analysis of the executable code structure and solution
sequence of the governing equations. Model equations are solved in a single iteration loop for serial
calculations in the following order:
1.

Flow field initialization

2.

If maximum number of iterations reached, stop the solution, otherwise, go to item 2

It is required for efficient and cost-effective incorporation of the OpenMP directives to figure out,
which part of the code can be easily and effectively parallelized.
It can be seen from the analysis of the proposed mathematical model and serial algorithm solution
order, that stages of velocity calculations, bubble volume fraction calculations and bubble number
density calculations are linearly dependent on the number of bubble classes introduced in polydisperse
model. Moreover, this equations are computationally independent from each other due to the fact, that
all source terms are updated at step 2 and used explicitly. Therefore, it seems reasonable to split all N
classes of bubbles into a few groups and attribute each group to the specific thread by the OpenMP
technology, each thread can be executed on the separate core of the processor. Due to the fact, that
calculation of velocities, volume fractions and number densities are carried out in separate FOR loops,
parallelization can be done by placing #pragma omp parallel for before each loop, which
resulted in minimal impact on the original source code. All other calculations are carried out in a serial
fashion.

4 Numerical Modeling of the Bubble Column
Simulation data was taken from the [22] for the flow inside a full-scale laboratory bubble column
reactor. The reactor has parallelepiped shape with dimensions of 500 mm width, 80 mm depth and
1500 mm hight. A bubble injector (sparger) has a circular shape of radius 20 mm and mounted in the
bottom wall at the distance of 160 mm from the left wall. The entire volume of the column is filled by
pure water and air bubbles are supplied into the reactor through the sparger with the superficial
velocity VG=0.66 mm/s. Rosin-Rammler distribution of bubbles was employed to describe bubble
spectrum, with the shape parameter k = 2 and λ = 2.26·10-3 resulted in the mean diameter of the initial
bubble equal to 2 mm. The experiments were carried out at normal conditions with room temperature
T=297 K and ambient pressure P=101350 Pa.
The hexahedral orthogonal mesh was constructed inside a computational domain with dense mesh
towards walls and the sparger to provide adequate resolution of boundary layers and air-water jet
structure. The top boundary condition was assumed as free surface allowing air bubbles freely leave
the domain while slip boundary condition was applied for the liquid phase. The buoyant force in the
current setup is the main driver of the flow, thus gravity is also included.
Simulations results of bubble distribution inside the bubble column for 5 bubble classes are shown
on the Fig. 1 and 2. Distributions of bubbles of different sizes are presented on the Fig. 1. It can be
seen that smaller bubbles are more strongly affected by transversal forces (lift and bubble dispersion)
and effectively smeared across the column, while big bubbles of 5mm in size are moved almost in
upright direction. Virtual mass force which reflects the fact that inertial mass of the bubble increased
by half due to attachment of liquid volume prevents bigger and heavier bubble from dispersion.

Distribution of total bubble volume fraction in different horizontal cross-sections is presented on
the Fig. 2. Despite that the lateral forces are small compared to buoyancy and drug forces, bubbles are
tend to move towards side wall as they are approaching free surface. Such behavior is common for
upright bubble motion while during downward motion they tend to gather in the center of the column.

Simulations for that particular case were carried out with different number of bubble classes.
OpenMP parallel version were run with various number of computational threads P to estimate the
impact of parallelization on the solution process. Results consisting computation time for 24 different
cases are presented in Table 1.
It is obvious that for single bubble class different number of threads has no impact. Increasing
number of classes for the case with only one thread resulted in increase of computation time, while the
increase is non-linear. This happened due to that the code contains parts which are not depended on the
number of bubble classes and always take almost the same computation time.
Computation time for each case of constant number of classes decreases with the increase of thread
number, but decrease almost stops when the condition P=N satisfies. Slight decrease of simulation
time in cases for N=20 and P greater than N can be addressed in different memory management and
thread to core allocation which impacts overall performance, thus per each pair of (N, P) several
simulations should be performed and average value of simulation time should be taken.
The more pronounced speed-up can be seen for the case with N=30. That is due to the fact that by
increasing N the time taken for the parts of the algorithm which can be parallelized increases, thus that
increases the efficiency of parallelization.

5 Conclusion
Due to the course of the work the numerical algorithm which is based on the mathematical model
of polydisperse multiphase flows was parallelized by the inclusion of the OpenMP directives. A set of
simulation cases was carried out to investigate the gravity-driven bubbly flow flow in the bubble
column and to analyze the effectiveness of parallelization on the supercomputers with shared memory
architecture.
It was shown that current realization of the numerical algorithm for solution of the equations for
polydisperse bubbly flows is capable for simple modification which resulted in parallelization of the
algorithm. Numerical simulation for the case with 5 bubble classes produced correct prediction of
bubble distribution inside the column, with the maximum value of bubble concentration near the walls
and slow column smearing for the big (5mm in radius) bubbles.
Simulations with different number of classes and computational threads have shown that maximum
effect of parallelization can be achieved at maximum number of bubble classes. Due to the presence of
the parts in the algorithm which are executed always in serial mode, deeper modification required to
achieve better performance.
