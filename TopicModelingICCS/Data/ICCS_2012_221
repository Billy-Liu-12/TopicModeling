Abstract
Recently the evolving model of network has become one of hot research topics. Since the BA model is presented, many kinds of
evolving models have been proposed. However the generation mechanism of existing evolving model of online social network
has certain limitation, i.e. researchers mostly focus on the factors that facilitating network growth but ignore the factors that
delaying network growth. In order to resolve this limitation, a new online social network evolving model (DFEM) is proposed in
this paper. In this model, the factors delaying network growth are defined as damping factor and which is divided into the decline
of initial attraction, the loss of node heat, and irresistible natural factors. In addition, the damping factors, the attractive factors,
and the degree of nodes are taken into consideration together in the preference link. The results of theoretical analysis and
numerical simulation suggest that the degree distribution of network generated by DFEM model is more correspond with existing
online social network.

Keywords: Online Social Network; attractive factor; damping factor; BA model; CALW model.

1. Introduction
With the application of the technology of Web 2.0 and the emergence of large online platforms such as QQ,
Facebook[1] , and Blog, the online social network has attracted many researches attention. Now the research on the
structure of social network is improving, meanwhile, the evolving law of online social network has become a hot
research field[2, 3].
As is known, the research of network evolving law is based on the establishment of evolving model. The essence
of evolving model is network generative mechanism, specifically including the relation of every component and the
whole characteristic generated by these relations. Research shows that the evolving model of most complex network
has two characteristics, which is (1) growth, that is, network is growing and (2) preference link, that is, a new node
tends to connect to the nodes which have larger degree. Recent years the research on evolving model of complex

network focuses on improving the characteristic of preference link. Based on BA model, many kinds of evolving
model have been proposed [4, 7, 9-12].
Online social network is a complex network comprise of a lot of nodes and edges, in which nodes represent users
and edges represent the links between users. There exists the following phenomenon when online social network
evolving, Take Blog as an example, the blog of a celebrity may have a very high click rate because of his/her
popularity at first, but as time growth the quantity and quality of the papers published by the bloger play the leading
role, rather than the bloger s popularity when a user decides whether read the bloger s paper or not. The problem of
low cluster coefficient of evolving model is solved in literature [15] by introducing the concept of attraction and
dividing it into initial attraction and evolutional attraction. However, the factors which delay the growth of network
are neglected in this literature, so based on the existing evolving model of complex network, a new Damping factorbased evolving model of online social network (DFEM) is proposed in this paper. This evolving model studies the
damping factors that delay the growth of network by introducing an absolutely new concept of damping factors and
comprehensively considers how degree of nodes, attractive factors, and damping factors influence the generative
mechanism of network in the way of preference link. The theory analysis and numerical simulation show that the
network generated by DFEM model is more suitable for existing online social network.
2. Background

2.1. BA scale-free network evolving model
Barabási and Albert proposed the BA scale free model[5,6] in 1999, this model has growth character and
preference link character. BA scale free network evolving model is described specifically as follows:
Growth. First initialize the network in which the number of nodes and edges is m0 and n0 separately, and then
introduce a new node at one timestep which will link to the m existing nodes (m m0) of the initial network.
Preference link. The probability that the new node links to the existing node i and the degree (ki )of node i
follows
ki
kj

i
j

The existing researches show that the BA model has certain limitations[4,8]. On the one hand, the index of
degree distribution of the scale-free network generated by BA model is 3, which is not suitable for the real network
whose index of degree distribution is between 1 and 3. On the other hand, researchers only consider the influence of
the degree of nodes on degree distribution in this model.
After t steps, a new network with N = t + m0 nodes and mt edges will be generated by this algorithm. From
Fig 1, we can clearly see the evolving process of BA network evolving model, where m0=m=2.There are only two
nodes in the network at first, the new node will link to the two existing node of the network according to the
preference attachment mechanism.

The research results show that the degree distribution of BA network evolving model follows power-law
distribution, which is consistent with the theoretical analysis result, see Fig 2.

2.2. CALW model
Wensheng Tian and Hongyong Yang proposed CALW model[15] which introduced the concept of attraction and
divided it into initial attraction and evolutional attraction. The algorithm is described as follows:
Initial condition. Initializing the network in which the number of nodes and edges is m0 and e0 separately.
Growth. Introducing a new node A and m edges at every timestep.
Preference link. Connecting the new node A with the m-1 old nodes in the local world according to preference

The experimental result shows that the lower cluster coefficient problem presented in BA model is well solved in
this model, while researchers only consider the factors that facilitate network growth such as initial attraction and
evolutional attraction but do not consider the factors that delaying network growth.
3. DFEM evolving model
In this paper the factors delaying network growth are defined as damping factor and divided it into the decline of
initial attraction, the loss of node heat, and irresistible natural factors. For instance, for the node j going to entering
into blog at t timestep, the major attraction of the node i entered into blog at t-1 timestep is initial attraction.
However, as time increasing the initial attraction is increasingly decline and the decrease of initial attraction is
represented by R1 in this paper. Moreover, the numbers node i connecting with other nodes per timestep after it
entering into blog is defined as node heat. The more times node i connecting with other nodes, the higher the node
heat is, and vice versa. If a node whose connection number is smaller than n (here let n = 7) at timestep t, this node
will be defined as zero-heat node, and representing the number of zero-heat nodes at t timestep in network by R2.
Actually, the remove of some edges is result from some irresistible natural factors, such as natural calamities and
computer losing power suddenly, making all these natural calamities represented by R3.

3.1. DFEM model algorithm
The evolving model proposed in this paper is defined as follows:
Initialize network. Initializing the network to the entire coupling network with n0 nodes and e0 edges.
Growth. Introducing a new node N at per timestep and connecting this node with the m existing nodes.
Preference link. The probability the new node N connecting with the m existing nodes is

where Ai is the initial attraction of the existing node i attracting the new node N at ti timestep, that is the degree of
the new node N.
Di(t) is the evolving attraction of node i attracting the new node N from ti to t, that is

Damping factor R3i(t) is the decline of edges resulting from some irresistible natural factors. Because it is small
probability events, in this paper let R3i(t)=0.
3.2. Theoretical analysis of degree distribution of DFEM model
The degree of node is the number of edges the node connecting to, and degree distribution is a probability
distribution function of node degree, that is, the probability that the node having k edges. As a kind of scale-free
complex network, the degree distribution of online social network follows by power-law. In order to describe
represent the sum of initial attraction and evolving attraction in formula (1)that is
conveniently, let
Ai Di t
and R represent the sum of damping factorR1i(t), R2i(t), and R3i(t), that is R=R1i t

R 2i t

R 3i t .

Assumption that the new node N enters network at ti timestep and the degree of node i connecting to N is
m , so node N connects to node i according to formula (1) and obtains the following formula

The above formula illustrates that as time increasing the change rate of k i is not only related with k i and
also related with damping factor R.

From formula(6), we can deduce that the node degree distribution of network p(k ) tends to be

evolving model is BA model.
4. The simulation results and degree distribution of DFEM model
Fig 3 describes the degree distribution of DFEM model in which network size is 10000, m=m0=5, and Ai=5. Fig 3
compares the degree distribution of DFEM model, BA model, and CALW model. Result shows that the degree

distribution of DFEM model is similar with BA and CALW. From this result the degree distribution is not only
related with node degree and the attraction itself but also related with damping factors. Moreover, because of
damping factors, the degree distribution function of DFEM model is between that of BA model and CALW model.
In order to study how damping factor R1 and R2 influence the degree distribution of DFEM model, let R1 and R2
take different values. Fig 5 describes the degree distribution when R1 is different but evolving attraction Di(t) and R2
have no change. Fig 6 describes the degree distribution when R2 is different but evolving attraction Di(t) and R1 have
no change. From Fig 5 and Fig 6, we can know that damping factor R1 mainly influences the node whose degree is
smaller and R2 mainly influences all of the network nodes especially the node whose degree is lager.

5. Conclusions
This DFEM evolving model is based on BA model, but when researching the factors that influent degree
distribution, we not only sufficiently consider the node attraction but also take the real existing damping factors into
consideration. In this paper we divide damping factors into the decline of initial attraction, the loss of node heat, and
irresistible natural factors, and then study how the decline of initial attraction and the loss of node heat effect degree
distribution of DFEM model. Using this method, the problem, only unilaterally researches how the node degree and

attraction effect the degree distribution, appears in BA model and CALW model. The simulation results illustrate the
exact of theoretical analysis which shows that the model proposed in this paper is more suitable for existing online
social network.
