Abstract. E-learning, as an innovative and alternative way of distance learning,
provides a strong challenge to the traditional learning with its unique advantage.
The paper, for the diffusion of e-learning adoption in China, investigates people’s
perceptions and attitudes toward adopting e-learning, and explores the factors
affecting the e-learning adoption behavior from innovation adoption perspective.
Based on the model of Rogers’ innovation adoption theory, the factors in each of
“perceived innovative attributes” that affect the individual adoption behavior will
be analyzed to test the relationship between these attributes and e-learning
adoption. The result shows that the four perceived innovative attributes, namely
“perceived relative advantage”, “perceived compatibility”, “perceived trialability”
and “percieved observability”, have certain influences on peoples’ adoption of elearning.
Keywords: Adoption intention; E-Learning; Adoption behavior; Perceived
innovation attributes; Innovation adoption theory; China.

1 Introduction
E-learning can offer potential learners an alternative and innovative learning
environment compared with the traditional learning [1]. As e-learning is still a new
concept for many people, their attitudes towards its application have not been fully
studied, especially in China [2]. It is believed that a better understanding of e-learning
adoption behavior would enable e-learning providers to offer courses more likely
accepted by future e-learners [1]. The innovation diffusion theory developed by
Rogers, is clarified five perceived attributes of the innovation, and has the influence
on the innovation adoption [3]. Based on extensive study on many different
innovations, the theory provides the basic model of how perceived attributes affect the
adoption of innovation. In the original framework proposed of Rogers, the adoption of
innovation was regarded as the dependent variable. Without breaking the consistency
of the original framework, some researchers had regarded the adoption of the

innovation as the dependent variable instead [4]. It appears that the importance of
issues related to the adoption of e-learning in China has not been fully recognized [2].
No previous studies have been conducted to analyze the perceptions of e-learning
adopters and e-learning adoption intention of non-adopters in China [2] [5]. Thus, this
research tries to explore the acceptance and intention of e-learning in China based on
the model of Rogers’ innovation adoption theory.

2 Methodology
2.1 Theoretical Framework of Assessment Method
Rogers has identified five attributes of an innovation that are key influencers on
innovation acceptance. According to Rogers, these characteristics include relative
advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability [3]. This research
will try to explore what the relationships between perceived attributes and the
adoption intention of e-learning by Chinese undergraduates as a case. The theoretical
framework of the paper regards five perceived innovation characteristics above as
independent variables, and the e-learning adoption intention as a dependent variable
whether or not to have influence on the e-learning adoption intention.
2.2 Research Hypothesis
Based on Rogers’s original model, the research hypotheses are as followings.
Hypothesis I: Higher level of perceived relative advantage will positively affect the
level of the intention of e-learning adoption (LIEA).
Hypothesis II: Higher level of perceived compatibility will positively affect LIEA.
Hypothesis III: Higher level of perceived complexity will negatively affect LIEA.
Hypothesis IV: Higher level of perceived trialability will positively affect LIEA.
Hypothesis V: Higher level of perceived observability will positively affect LIEA.

3 Results and Discussion
A total of 154 questionnaires are distributed and collected, 134 of which are valid
responses. All valid respondents said they had not ever obtained a formal qualification
through an e-learning course in the past or are currently engaged in an e-learning
course. 97 percent of respondents are between 18 and 22, and only 3 percent between
23 and 25. Similarly, all respondents are full-time undergraduates.
3.1 Respondents’ Perception on Innovative Attributes
With regard to the questions on each of the five components of the theoretical
framework, the respondents were asked their opinions on various statements. In order
to analyze the respondents’ information, the scales of answers are coded and divided
into five groups of Strongly Agree (5), Agree (4), Uncertain (3), Disagree (2), and
Strongly Disagree (SD, 1).

As a result, there is not more difference between the individual answers in each of
the eleven questions. The highly perceived relative advantage of e-learning is
“pricing, flexibility, personal control, access (time) and access (place)” (around 4).
SD in compatibility indicates that there are not more differences (around 3 except
question 7). Students have generally a higher level perception on the complexity of elearning adoption except “access to technology”. Perceptions on trialability are quite
high comparing other innovative attributes(above 3.50). Except “opportunities to
observe other e-learners experiences”, the other three questions are between 3.10 and
3.34.
3.2 Summary of Respondents’ Perception vs. Intention
Analyzing table 1 horizontally, the value points on relative advantage, compatibility,
trialability and observability are all descending with the decrease of intention degrees.
That is the same situation as the hypothesis above that the higher perception of
relative advantage, compatibility, trialabililty and observability be, the higher level of
intention on adopting e-learning be. However, except complexity, respondents who
are unlikely or very unlikely to try e-learning have similar levels of perceived
complexity as these who choose “likely” or “very likely”, as indicates that complexity
hypothesis in Roger’s theory is not true in China’s case.

3.3 Hypothesis Tests
Collecting required information from respondents to test research hypotheses, the
correlation analysis has been conducted by the relationships established between
respondents’ intention to adopt e-learning and their perceptions on different
innovation attributes (Table 2). Hypothesis I is accepted. The results show that the
level of intention to adopt e-learning is significantly related to the perceived relative
advantage. It suggests that the higher the perceived level of relative advantage over
traditional learning, the more likely students would adopt e-learning method.
Hypothesis II is accepted. According to the correlation analysis, perceived
compatibility is found to have significant positive influence on e-learning adoption.
Hypothesis III is rejected (not significant). The results show that the perceived
complexity of e-learning has no significant negative influence on students’ adoption
intention, as seems inconsistent with previous studies on innovation adoptions.

Hypothesis IV is accepted. There is significant positive relationship between
perceived trialability and e-learning adoption. Hypothesis V is accepted. The more
visible the results of an innovation, the more likely the innovation will be adopted. To
Chinese students, whether they are aware of benefits and advantages demonstrated by
other e-learners will affect their adoption decisions.

Conclusion

The study suggests that Rogers’ innovation adoption theory provide useful framework
to examine e-learning acceptance behavior as a case. Findings help to gain valuable
insights into the factors of e-learning adoption decision and how e-learning benefits
perceived affect adoption intention. However, the paper has certain limitations due to
its sample selection, sample size and respondents profile; Moreover, using crosssectional survey, the changes of perception in a long term could be ignored.
