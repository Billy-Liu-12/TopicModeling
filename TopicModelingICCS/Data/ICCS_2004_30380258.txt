Abstract. Recently, the concern of software quality increases rapidly. Although
there have been many efforts to establish standards for software quality, such as
ISO/IEC 9126, they provide only a framework for quality characteristics and
evaluation process. They do not provide practical guidance for deriving
reasonable weight value criteria for quality evaluation. 1 This paper presents a
method to draw the quantitative weight values from evaluator's subjective data
in software evaluation in compliance with ISO/IEC 9126 standard. To eliminate
evaluators' subjectiveness and uncertainty, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory is
improvised and utilized. The D-S theory is improved with merge rule to reduce
the bias of weight value when they are merged with other evaluator's weight
value. The proposed merge rule has been tested for it’s effectiveness with actual
evaluation data.

1 Introduction
Software quality is defined as a specification of functions of which software performs.
High quality software means that it not only satisfies its specification, but also
achieves its quality characteristics, such as functionality, reliability, usability, efficiency, maintainability, portability. To evaluate software quality based on these quality characteristics, various standards and techniques can be applied. ISO/IEC 9126
[1], for example, provides a standard for establishing software quality characteristics
and metrics. ISO/IEC 14598 [2] provides methods and procedures for performing of
quality authentication. These standards, however, does not specify specific evaluation
technique such as the calculation of weight value for evaluation items. Consequently,
software quality evaluation tends to depend on assessor's subjective judgment and
knowledge. That is, the interpretation of evaluation criteria, semantic relation between
evaluation items, and measurement depends on evaluators’ viewpoint [3], [4], [5].
Existing studies also overlook the problem of producing incorrect result in combining
different weight values from multiple assessors [6], [7], [8].

Determination and Combination of Quantitative Weight Value

259

This paper describes a quantitative method for calculating the weight value of
evaluation items by combining different evaluation values which is retrieved from
multiple assessors’ subjective opinion. Specifically, this paper discusses how to
improve the way of aggregating and combining multiple assessors' opinions
considering the relations between the evaluation items.

2.1 Inference Using Bayes’ Theory
Bayes' theory [11], [12], [13] is a statistical inference technique to estimate the
probability of certain event occurring in which different hypotheses are given for each
evidence. Assuming that there exists mutually exclusive hypothesis Hk (k=1,2,…,n)
for a certain evidence E, then Bayes' theory is described as following (1).

P( Hn | E ) =

( P( E | Hn) ⋅ P( Hn))

∑

n
k =1

P ( E | Hk ) ⋅ P( Hk )

(1)

From the above expression, Hn and E are related in cause and effect relation. Then,
P(Hn) is called as a priori probability and P(Hn|E) as a posteriori probability. Bayes’
theory, however, has a few problems in its application. First, if there are n numbers of
evidence and m numbers of hypothesis, it is necessary to know in prior n*m numbers
of probability. This means that a large number of evidence and hypothesis requires a
great number of priori probability calculation. In reality, it is not possible to provide
all priori probability values in advance. Second, the probability value in Bayes' theory
is assumed to be mutually exclusive. That is, if the probability of a certain event
occurring be 0.5, then the probability for the event not occurring is 1-0.5=0.5.
However, in real situation, the probability for an event not occurring isn’t always 0.5
since it is not known whether a certain event occurrs or not. Finally, there is no rule
for successively accruing the probability value in Bayes' theory. That is, if a new
hypothesis is introduced, the Bayes theory has to compute the probability from the
scratch again.
2.2 Quantitative Translation from Qualitative Relationship
The technique of deriving quantitative value from qualitative relationship information
can be achieved by using Dempster Shafer (DS) theory [9], [10], [14], [17]. It uses
the qualitative preference relations such as “A is more important than B” or “A is
similar to C.”
DS theory compensates the drawbacks of Bayes’ theory by defining the belief of
hypothesis on H to an interval between Bel(H) and Pl(H). Bel(H) is a belief value of
a given evidence and Pl(H) is a plausibility value based on evidence. DS theory also
provides a combination rule on merging two random variables that are independent
s
each other (2). A function m: 2 → [0,1] (S is a frame of discernment) is called a basic
probability assignment [11], [12], [13], [15], [16].

This combination rule, however, may generate an empty set after intersection of
two discernments [7], [8]. This can degrade the correctness of combination results. In
addition, none of intending hypothesis can have total value, 1, after normalization
process. This means that the lower supporting discernments can produce the higher
supporting value after the combination as shown in table 1.

m3(ø) = 0.09
m3(ø) = 0.81
m3({a}) = 0.01 / 0.01 = 1

3 Improved Combination Rule in DS
As described earlier, the normal combination rule in DS theory can generate empty
sets when different discernments are combined. The improved combination rule can
reflect assessor’s different opinions by redistributing the empty set value to the discernment. Table 2 shows the result of combining the exclusive discernments using the
improved combination rule. Let the basic probability assignment (bpa) assigned by
assessor A be m1 and bpa by assessor B be m2. From the table 2, since m1({b})=0.9,
m2({c})=0.9, the result of combination of m1 and m2 is m3({∅})=0.81. This means
that assessor A assigns the wider opinion to discernment b and assessor B assigns the
wider opinion to discernment c. In common, it assigns the narrower opinion to
discernment a since the value of m3({∅}) is redistributed to the discernment b and c.
In the same way, m3({b})=0.405 and m3({c})=0.405. The final result after the
combination shows in table 2.

4 Weight Value Determination in Software Quality Evaluation
This chapter describes an example in calculating the weight value of software quality
characteristics such as reliability defined in ISO/IEC 9126. For calculating the weight
value, the first step is to determine the focal elements from assessors’ qualitative
preference evaluation. After determining the focal elements, the basic probability
assignment (bpa) value is computed [9], [10], [14], [17]. If there is more than one
assessor, then apply the improved combination rule in combining the bpas. Finally,
compute a weight value using the belief function (Bel) and the probability function
(Pl).

(1) Determining the Focal Elements and bpa
Given assessor’s qualitative preference relationship, the focal element can be determined using the following definition (3) and (4).
A ⋅>B ↔ A is higher weight value than B.

(3)

A S B ↔ (:(A>B) & :(B>A)) ↔ A is similar weight value to B

(4)

Let T={a, b, c, d} be the discernment and assume that an assessor has defined
preference relationship as in (5).
{a}>{d}, {b ,c}>{b}, {c, d}<{d}, {a, b, c} S {b, c}, {b} S {d}, {b}>0, {d}>0

(5)

To determine the focal elements, it is necessary to eliminate illogical elements by
using the elimination theorem [9], [10], [14], [17]. From the theorem, since {c,
d}<{d} and {a, b, c} S {b, c}, {c, d} and {a, b, c} are not focal elements. In this way,
the complete focal elements can be achieved: {a}, {b}, {b, c}, {c}, {d}.
After achieving the focal elements, the bpa of m1 can be obtained using the
equality and perceptron algorithm as following.

 m1({a})  2  0.25 
 m1({b})  1  0.125

(2) Application of the Improved Combination Rule

In case there is more than one assessor, then the improved combination rule is
applied. Let’s assume that other assessor’s qualitative preference relationship is given
as (6).
{a} S {b}, {b ,c}>{a}, {b, c}<{b}, {c} S {d}, {a}>0, {d}>0

(6)

The bpa and m2 can be obtained by repeating step (1).

 m 2({a})  1  0.125
 m2({b})  1  0.125



 m 2({c})  2  0.25 
 m 2({d })  2  0.25 
Applying the improved combination rule to the bpa of m1 and m2, the results of the
bpa of m3 is shown blow. To evaluate other assessor’s value, repeat step (1) and (2).

 m3({a})  0.18
 m3({b})  0.15

  
bpa of m3 = m3({b, c}) = 0.16

  
 m3({c})  0.33
 m3({d })  0.18
(3) Computation of a Weight Value Using Bel and Pl

The values of Bel and Pl function can be computed by using bpa of m3.
Bel({a}) = m3({a}) = 0.18, Bel({b}) = m3({b}) = 0.15,
Bel({c}) = m3({c}) = 0.33, Bel({d}) = m3({d}) = 0.18
Pl({a}) = m3({a}) = 0.18,
Pl({b}) = m3({b}) + m3({b,c}) = 0.15 + 0.16 = 0.31,
Pl({c}) = m3({c}) + m3({b,c}) = 0.33 + 0.16 = 0.49, Pl({d}) = m3({d}) = 0.18
The interval of focal elements using the values of Bel and Pl function is then
{a}=[0.18, 0.18], {b}=[0.15, 0.31], {c}=[0.33, 0.49], {d}=[0.18, 0.18]
In this case, the focal element {b} ranges from 0.15 to 0.31. This means that the belief
interval of focal element {b} is between 0.15 and 0.31. Then the weight value of focal
element is determined by averaging the values of belief interval. The final weight
value is given below.
Weight value of {a}=0.18, Weight value of {b}=0.23,
Weight value of {c}=0.41, Weight value of {d}=0.18

5 Evaluation Result and Analysis
5.1 Comparison of the Combination Rule

From the table 3, the results of normal combination of A and B are empty for any
focal element because it is not possible to compute a weight value. However, the
improved combination shows no empty set thanks to redistribution of empty set value.
5.2 Analysis of Improved Combination Rule

As shown in figure 1, the change of bpa on the focal element {a} using the improved
combination is reduced from 0.7 to 0.392. This result indicates that assessor A assigns
a high value to {a} but assessor B doesn’t assigns any value to {a}. The change of bpa
on the improved combination for A and C in table 3 is raised from 0.7 to 0.784. This
result explains that both assessor A and assessor B assigns high value to {a}.
Two combination results on bpa with focal element {b} are same since the focal
element {b} is not common on the two combinations. On the other hand, bpa of focal
element {a} is 0.784 because focal element {a} is common on the combination of
both assessor A and C. Table 4 illustrates that combination result of multi evaluation
items.
The change of bpa on the combination A and B in table 4 is also raised from 0.5 to
0.701. Although assessor B had given preference relationship including multiple
evaluation items such as {a} > {b,c}, we can obtain proper combination result.

6 Conclusion
The weight value calculation plays a key role in evaluation and selection of good
quality software. This paper describes an quantitative method for calculating the
weight value using DS theory. The proposed method eliminates the problem of
assessor's subjective opinion and also improves the way of combining multiple
assessors' opinion. The effectiveness of the new method has been verified with an
example. The improved DS theory, however, still suffers from a great amount of
2
numeric calculation (Ο(n )) since it uses every exclusive bpas.
