Introduction

A majority of available studies refer to the one- or two-phase inverse Stefan problem [1,2,3,4,8,11,16,18], whereas studies regarding the three-phase inverse Stefan
problem are scarce [5,6,7,15]. In paper [15], three tasks are identiﬁed, successively
in a liquid, solid and mush zone, on the basis of which the sought convective heat
transfer coeﬃcient is then determined. The method described in papers [6,7] consists of minimization of a functional, whose value is the norm of diﬀerence between
the given positions of phase-change front and the positions reconstructed based
on the selected function describing the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient. In paper [5], a solution is found in a linear combination form of functions satisfying the
heat conduction equation. The coeﬃcients of the combination are determined by
the least square method to minimize the maximal defect in the initial-boundary
data, thus making it possible to ﬁnd the temperature distribution, the heat ﬂux,
or the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient for the boundary.
The method of the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient identiﬁcation in a threephase inverse design Stefan problem is presented in this paper. The convective
heat transfer coeﬃcient will be sought in the form of a continuous function, nonlinearly dependent on the parameters sought. A genetic algorithm was used to determine these parameters. The direct Stefan problem was solved via a generalized
alternating phase truncation method [9, 14]. Stability of the whole algorithm was
ensured by applying the Tikhonov regularization technique [10, 17]. The featured
example calculations show a very good approximation of the exact solution.

Three-Phase Problem

Now, we are going to describe an algorithm for the solution of a three-phase
inverse design Stefan problem. Let the boundary of the domain D = [0, b] ×
[0, t∗ ] ⊂ R2 be divided into seven parts (Figure 1), where the boundary and initial
conditions are given, and let the D domain be divided into three subdomains D1 ,
D2 and D3 (D = D1 ∪ D2 ∪ D3 ). Let Γ1,2 will designate the common boundary
of domains D1 and D2 , whilst Γ2,3 will mean the common boundary of domains
D2 and D3 . Let us assume that boundary Γk,k+1 is described by function x =
ξk,k+1 (t).
For the given partial position of interfaces Γ1,2 and Γ2,3 , we will determine
function α(t) deﬁned on boundaries Γ2k (k = 1, 2, 3) and temperature distributions Tk , which inside domains Dk (k = 1, 2, 3) fulﬁl the heat conduction
equation:

whereas on moving interfaces Γ1,2 and Γ2,3 , they fulﬁl the condition of temperature continuity and the Stefan condition (k = 1, 2):

T0 is the initial temperature, T∞ is the ambient temperature, Tk,k+1

Function α(t), describing the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient, will be sought
in the form of a function dependent (linearly or non-linearly) on n parameters:
α(t) = α(t; α1 , α2 , . . . , αn ).

Let V mean a set of all functions in form (7). In real processes, function α(t)
does not have an arbitrary value. Therefore, the problem of minimization with

constraints has some practical importance. Let Vc mean a set of those functions
from set V , for which αi ∈ [αli , αui ], αli < αui , αli , αui ∈ R, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n.
For the given function α(t) ∈ Vc , the problem (1)–(6) becomes a direct Stefan problem, whose solution makes it possible to ﬁnd the positions of interfaces
ξ1,2 (t) and ξ2,3 (t) corresponding to function α(t). By using the interface posi∗
tions found, ξk,k+1 (t), and the given positions ξk,k+1
(t) (k = 1, 2), we can build
a functional which will deﬁne the error of an approximate solution:

where γ is the regularization parameter. The discrepancy principle proposed
by Morozov will be used to determine the regularization parameter [17, 10].
The above norms denote the norms in a space of square-integrable functions
in the interval (0, t∗ ). When the exact position of the interface is given only in
selected points (hereafter called the ”control points”), the ﬁrst norm present in
functional (8) will be calculated from the following dependence:

Genetic Algorithm

For the representation of the vector of decision variables, a chromosome was used
in the form of a vector of real numbers (real number representation) [12, 13].
The tournament selection and elitist model were applied in the algorithm. This
selection is carried out so that two chromosomes are drawn and the one with
better ﬁtness, goes to a new generation. There are as many draws as individuals
that the new generation is supposed to include. In the elitist model the best
individual of the previous generation is saved and, if all individuals in the current
generation are worse, the worst of them is replaced with the saved best individual
from the previous population.
As the crossover operator, arithmetical crossover was applied, where as a result
of crossing of two chromosomes, their linear combinations are obtained:
α1 = r α1 + (1 − r) α2 ,

α2 = r α2 + (1 − r) α1 ,

(10)

where parameter r is a random number with a uniform distribution from the
domain [0, 1].
In the calculations, a nonuniform mutation operator was used as well. During
mutation, the αi gene is transformed according to the equation:
αi =

αi + Δ(τ, αui − αi ),
αi − Δ(τ, αi − αli ),

(11)

and a decision is taken at random which from the above formulas should be
applied, where:
τ
(12)
Δ(τ, x) = x 1 − r(1− N )d ,
and r is a random number with a uniform distribution from the domain [0, 1],
τ is the current generation number, N is the maximum number of generations
and d is a constant parameter (in the calculations, d = 2 was assumed).
In calculations parameters used for the genetic algorithm are as follows: population size npop = 70, number of generations N = 500, crossover probability
pc = 0.7 and mutation probability pm = 0.1.

Numerical Example

Now we will present an example illustrating the application of the method discussed. An axisymmetric problem is considered in the example, where: b = 0.06
[m], λ1 = 54 [W/(m K)], λ2 = 42 [W/(m K)], λ3 = 30 [W/(m K)], c1 = 840
[J/(kg K)], c2 = 755 [J/(kg K)], c3 = 670 [J/(kg K)], 1 = 7000 [kg/m3 ],

[J/kg], T1,2 = 1773 [K], T2,3 = 1718 [K], T∞ = 303 [K] and T0 = 1803 [K].

The parameters describing the exact form of function α(t) are:
α1 = 1200,

α2 = 600,

t2 = 90.

Set Vc is deﬁned in the following way:
Vc = α(t) ∈ V : α1 ∈ [1000, 1400], α2 ∈ [400, 700], t2 ∈ [50, 150] .

(14)

In the alternating phase truncation method, the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method was
used, the calculations having been made on a grid of discretization intervals
equal Δt = 0.1 and Δx = b/500. A change (reasonable) of the grid density did
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect the results obtained.
The giving of two points: P1 (0, α1 ) and P2 (t2 , α2 ) (see Figure 2) explicitly
determines the exponential function in form (13), however, the same function
can be determined through deﬁning points P1 (0, α1 ) and P3 (t3 , α3 ). Therefore,
the problem of reconstructing function α(t) in form (13) based on three parameters: (α1 , α2 , t2 ), has inﬁnitely many solutions. For this reason, the accuracy
of solution in this case will be determined for the entire function α(t), and not
separately for each of the sought parameters . Thus, the relative percentage error
will be calculated from the following relation:

where αe (t) is the exact value of function α(t), and αa (t) is an approximate
value of function α(t).
The calculations were made for an accurate moving interface position and for a
position disturbed with a pseudorandom error of normal distribution. Results for
1%, 2% and 5% disturbance are presented in the paper. Also, the inﬂuence of the
number of control points, i.e. the number of points where the interface position
is known (including the addends in sum (9)), has been examined. The results
of interface control carried out every 0.1, 0.2, 0.5 and 1 seconds are presented
below. They correspond to a situation where M = 2093, 1047, 419, 210.

given without disturbance, the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient was reconstructed with minimal errors resulting from the chosen algorithm termination
point, whereas for the disturbed input data, the result’s error is much lower
than the error at the beginning. For the highest disturbance equal to 5% and for

Conclusion

This paper discussed the identiﬁcation of the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient
in a three-phase inverse design Stefan problem. The problem consists in the reconstruction of the function which describes the convective heat transfer coeﬃcient,
where the position of the moving interfaces of the phase change are well-known.
The convective heat transfer coeﬃcient is sought in the form of a continuous function, non-linearly dependent on the parameters sought. A genetic algorithm was
used to determine these parameters. The direct Stefan problem was solved via
a generalized alternating phase truncation method. Stability of the whole algorithm was ensured by applying the Tikhonov regularization technique.
The calculations made show stability of the proposed algorithm in terms of the
input data errors and the number of control points. The application of genetic
algorithms yields better results than the classical nonderivative optimization
methods (e.g. the Nelder-Mead method). A comparison of the results for the
two-phase problem is included in paper [16]. In that case, the scatter of the
results obtained is also much smaller.
In the future we are going to use the presented algorithm for the solution of
the inverse Stefan problem in which measured temperatures are given at some
points of the domain.
