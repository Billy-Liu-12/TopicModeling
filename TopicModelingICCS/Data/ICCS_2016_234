Abstract
For the problems that we can’t monitor continuous heart information so as to make efficient training
plans. A ZigBee and big data analysis based pulse monitoring system has been proposed. The system
is composed of multiple ZigBee based pulse monitoring sensors, customized gateways and back-end
system. Individuals’ pulse information are collected by the sensors and passed to back-end system to
support big data analysis of the training conditions. Results shows the system can be used to improve
the physical training level; accumulate the training data of the individuals and support more efficient
and scientific training plans.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, along with the development of IOT technology especially the wearable devices, many
researchers have put their focus on the hot point that collecting different kinds of parameters of the
body during sports. These parameters can be location, pulse, blood pressure and so on. The devices
used to collect the parameters can be rings, finger devices and heart rate tie. During the training of our
students, we also need find out efficient methods to make sure their training plans are safety and
scientific. We divide existing demand of the system into two categories as follows:

[1] Sensing changing of position
Kinds of the devices using GPS modules[1~2] may have the shortcomings such as they pay more
attention to the steps and consumption of the energy and cannot sense changing of position of the
individuals in a given zone precisely.
At the same time, Zigbee technology provides a good solution for wireless transmission through
sensor signals[3~6]. Most of Zigbee nodes have the coverage of tens of meters. And we can also expand
the coverage region by increasing the routing nodes. Therefore, we can adopt a variety of pulse
sensors to collect pulse information and send them to the gateway nodes acting as coordinator. The
gateway nodes can be placed around the track and end Zigbee nodes are in the rings of the individuals.
[2] Sensing changing of pulse[7~11]
There are several methods to get pulse information as follows:
Method using PVDF sensors or capacitance sensors. These kinds of methods implement the
measurement by sensing variation of the pressure of the skin. The signal is very weak and the sensor
should touch the skin tightly so as to avoid small shifting of the skin affecting the sensing procession
to a large extent and reducing the SNR(Signal Noise Ratio).
Method using electroacoustic sensors. Electro acoustic sensors complete the pulse sensing with
help of electro acoustic converting method. The sensor should touch the skin tightly and small shifting
of the skin will affect the sensing procession to a large extent and reduce the SNR too. At the same
time, external noise environment may be complex and it may affect signal collecting easier.
Method using photoelectric sensors. Existing photoelectric method use red light and infrared light
to project the blood vessel and detect variation of the blood volume caused by blood circulation. The
variation will be dealt into pulse signal wave form and the wave form will be processed by the
amplified circuit, conditioning circuit, amplitude modulation circuit and baseline adjustment circuit to
output pulse information.
Therefore, this paper uses photoelectric sensing technology, combined with effective anti-jamming
method to support efficient pulse monitoring data and use big data based analyzing methods to provide
support for scientific training.

2.1 Photoelectric Sensing based Pulse Signal Detection
As depicted in figure 1 is our basic measurement of SpO 2 ratio and pulse. The first stage
amplifying circuit and the two stage amplifying circuit are used to restrain the common-mode signal

and amplify the differential mode signals to add common mode rejection. The circuit uses difference
as input and uses high-pass/low-pass filters to filter signal of other frequencies. There are a red light
Led, infrared light LED and a photodiode integrated in the ring and all these LED are controlled by the
LED control circuit. When signal conditioning circuit detects red and infrared light it will pass the
signal into the 12 bit ADC module in DSC(digital signal controller) to compute SpO 2 ratio.

Basic Procession of Measurement

Signal conditioning circuit is composed of two levels, the first of which is a cross resistance
amplifier, and the second is a gain one. The first level amplifier transforms the current from ptotodiode
to millivolt voltage and a high-pass filter is between the two amplifiers to reduce disturb form
background light. Signal from high-pass filter is sent to the second level amplifier and its signal
potential is in the ADC range of MCU. Output from analog signal conditioning circuit is connected
with 12 bit ADC module in DSC.
At the same time, we improve the quality of the pulse signal from two aspects as follows:
(1) Weak signal detection and noise elimination
The first step of the signal sensing procession is executed by the oximeter integrated in the ring
around the wrist to realize the attendant measurement. The second step is calculating the SpO 2 ratio
value. The third step is transmitting the pulse information by the Zigbee based network while the last
one is analyzing the info and making scientific training plan based on the big data methods. For the
signal is weak and usually be disturbed by external noises during the first step, we bring in a series of
amplify and filter in the circuit to filter the noise and get an accurate pulse signal. We use FIR filter to
eliminate power frequency disturb and other high frequency disturb.
(2) Spatial spectrum estimate based anti-jamming
Combination between space angles and frequency points forms the spatial spectrum which will help us
get efficient DOA(Directions of Arrival). Spatial spectrum estimation direction finding technology can
realize multiple target direction finding(including coherent signal and non coherent signal) and it can
get higher measurement precision with lower SNR(Signal Noise ratio).

2.2 Construction of the ZigBee based network
ZigBee is a global communication Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that provides a short distance,
low speed, low power consumption communication with a longer battery life .With the development
of network communication, ZigBee can be used to solve issues and improve people’s lives, such as by
reducing the inconvenience of wiring technology, providing remote sensing, improving home
domestic appliances, and automation control. We use the extendable design mode to make the gateway
be general and support multiple communication protocols such as GPRS, Wi-Fi and so on.

Architecture of the ZigBee based Network with the Center of Customized General Gateway

As depicted in figure 2, the architecture is divided into several parts as follows:


Signal collecting terminal. The terminal is designed as a ring and it is composed of oximeter

and ZigBee nodes.


ZigBee based wireless gateway. We use ARM as the core controller and ȝC/OS-䊡 as the OS.

Then transplanting TCP/IP protocol stack and ZigBee protocol stack to be in charge of management of
the network, resolution and transmitting of the packages.


Back-end System. Back-end system is used to manage the information interaction of WSN

and the clouding system directly. And data collecting from WSN will be fused in it to provide data
basis for the judgment of different conditions.

3 Conclusions
With development of IOT(Internet of Things), more and more wearable systems have been used to
strengthen existing applications. Therefore, we have built up a Zigbee and big data analysis based
pulse monitoring system. In future works, we will use the system for all of the students and
accumulate more data to realize more efficient big data based analysis methods.
