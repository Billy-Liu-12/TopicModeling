Abstract
Forest ﬁre propagation prediction is a key point to ﬁght against such hazards. Several models
and simulators have been developed to predict forest ﬁre propagation. These models require
input parameters such as digital elevation map, vegetation map, and other parameters describing the vegetation and meteorological conditions. Coupling wind ﬁeld model and forest ﬁre
propagation model improves accuracy prediction, but increases signiﬁcantly prediction time.
This fact is critical since propagation prediction must be provided in advance to allow the
control centers to manage ﬁreﬁghters in the best possible way. This work analyses WindNinja
execution time, describes a WindNinja parallelisation based on map partitioning, determines
the limitations of such methodology for large maps and presents an improvement based on
adapting map resolution to accomplish execution time limitations.

Introduction

Forest ﬁres are natural hazards that every year destroy thousands of hectares around the world,
causing signiﬁcant looses from the ecological, economical and social point of view. To ﬁght
against these hazards and mitigate their eﬀects it is crucial to determine beforehand their evolution to use the available resources in the best possible way. So, several models, such as FARSITE [1] of FireStation[3] have been developed to predict forest ﬁre propagation. These models
require input parameters such as digital elevation map, vegetation map, and other parameters
describing the vegetation and meteorological conditions. However, some meteorological parameters, such as wind speed and direction, change from one point to another one due to the eﬀect
of the topography of the terrain. Therefore, it is necessary to couple wind ﬁeld models, such
as WindNinja, to estimate the wind speed and direction at a higher resolution (30x30 meters).
The output provided by the wind ﬁeld simulator is used as input of the ﬁre propagation model.
So, coupling wind ﬁeld model and forest ﬁre propagation model improves accuracy prediction,
but increases signiﬁcantly prediction time. This fact is critical since propagation prediction

must be provided in advance to allow the control centers to manage ﬁreﬁghters in the best
possible way.
In this context, the execution time of wind ﬁeld simulator becomes a signiﬁcant issue that
must be deeply studied. So, this work analyses WindNinja execution time, describes a WindNinja parallelisation based on map partitioning and determines the map resolution required
to reduce execution time under the operational time contraints, but keeping the error under
signiﬁcant limits. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the main
features and limitations of WindNinja wind ﬁeld simulator and introduces the map partitioning
approach. Section 3 introduces a new methodology to overcome the diﬃculties in solving wind
ﬁelds for very large maps based on adapting the map resolution. Section 4 summarizes the
experimental results considering wind ﬁeld and forest ﬁre propagation, and ﬁnally section 5
summarizes this work.

WindNinja Wind ﬁeld simulator and map partitioning

WindNinja [2] is a wind ﬁeld simulator based on mass conservation equations that determines
the wind at each point of the terrain, given the meteorological wind speed and direction. To
carry out such calculations, it requires two main inputs: Wind parameters and a digital elevation
map of the terrain.
When the map size is limited, WindNinja is a very stable wind ﬁeld simulator that generates
the wind ﬁeld very fast and does not present memory limitations. However, when the map size
increases the execution time becomes prohibitive. It has been stated in [4] that the execution
time depends linearly on the number of cells in the map and on the computing power of the
underlying architecture as shown in Equation 1.
t = a · N CP + b

(1)

where N CP is the number of cells of the map, and a and b are the parameters representing
the features of the hardware platform. From this expression it can be derived that, given a
maximum execution time, the maximum number of cells in a map to be computed in such time
can be expressed as shown in Equation 2.
tmax − b
= λ(t)

Considering the urgency of providing forest ﬁre propagation prediction, the wind ﬁeld calculation should take a maximum execution time, for example 100 seconds. This means that,
for example, for a Dual-Core Intel Xeon 5150 processor, the largest map to be solved would be
a 400x400 cells map, which is too small for real big ﬁres considering 30 meters resolution.
To overcome these limitations, a map partitioning strategy with overlapping was developed
to divide the terrain map in parts smaller than 400x400 cells. Actually a certain degree of
overlapping (50 cells per side) is applied to each part to minimize border eﬀects [4].
Actually there is a diﬀerence between the wind ﬁeld calculated considering a 1500x1500 cells
map and the wind ﬁeld obtained by aggregating the wind ﬁelds obtained for each map part,
even using the same overlapping of 50 cells per side. But in our case, more important than the
wind ﬁeld diﬀerence is the diﬀerence in the forest ﬁre propagation predicted by using diﬀerent wind ﬁelds. Such diﬀerence among the predicted burned areas using diﬀerent WindNinja
conﬁgurations is estimated by calculating the symmetric diﬀerence between both areas.
A large experimentation has been carried out considering more map sizes, partitionings and
wind speeds, and it has been possible to make a graphic (Figure 1) that shows, for each map size
N CPmax =

and wind speed, the minimum number of cells per partition to keep the forest ﬁre propagation
diﬀerence under 0.1.This graphic points out that for low wind speed (under 3km/h) the map
parts can be as small as possible (40000 cells including overlap). However, when wind speed is
larger the minimum number of cells depends linearly on wind speed and also on total map size.
So, the larger the map, the larger the minimum number of cells.

Figure 1: Minimum number of cells per partition for a given map size and wind speed.
From linear regression it has been determined that this minimum number of cells per partition can be expressed as shown in equation 3.
N CPmin = M ax{40000; x + y · N T + z · N T · Sp}

(3)

where N T is the total number of cells of the map, Sp is the wind speed, and x, y and z
are the terms obtained from multiple regression. From our experiments it has been obtained
that x = −8.63 · 103 , y = −5.71 · 10−2 and z = +2.31 · 10−3 . From this minimum number
of cells it is possible to determine the maximum number of partitions of the map. However,
this minimum number of cells can overpass the maximum number of cells per partition that
has been previously determined to accomplish the maximum execution time of 100 seconds
(400x400 cells). Therefore, it is necessary to check the feasibility of keeping both boundaries.
It must be taken into account that the total number of cells of the map (N T ) is a factor
that can vary depending on the map resolution. So, it is possible to express N T as a function
of the terrain area (Area) and the map resolution (R).

Substituting 4 in 3, this equation can be expressed as shown in Equation 5.

Adapting map resolution

The critical point is that the minimal number of cell per partition (Equation 5) must be smaller
than the maximum number of cells obtained in Equation 2. This fact can be expressed as shown
is Equation 6.

And then the minimal resolution can be determined as shown in Equation 8. In this Equation
a minimal number of 30 meters is introduced because this is the current resolution of usual
digital elevation maps.

From this expression it is possible to determine for a particular Area map, wind speed
and time limit the minimal map resolution that can be used. Once the map resolution has
been determined, the minimal number of cells per partition can be obtained from expression
5. However, each part must consider 50 cells of overlapping per side. So, the actual number of
cells per partition is:
N CP =

where Np is the number of the partition of the map. Considering that N CP must be as a
maximum λ(t), it can obtained the number of partitions of the map as shown in Equation 10.

Experimental results

Table 1 summarises some results for diﬀerent maps and conditions. In this table the map Area,
execution time limit and wind speed are shown. From these values, the map resolution (R),
the number of parts (Np ) and the number of cells per partition (N CP )are obtained. Once
the map has been partitioned according to the obtained values, the diﬀerence in wind ﬁeld
(RM SE, N C1 and RM SEM ), and the diﬀerence in forest ﬁre propagation (D) considering the
map without partitioning are estimated.

Table 1: Application of map resolution adaptation
In the case of a 45Kmx45Km terrain map and an execution time limit of 100 seconds,
λ(t) is ﬁxed in 160000. Applying Equation 8 the minimum resolution obtained is 28.2 meters.
However, current maps has a resolution of 30 meters and, therefore, the resolution applied is
2752

30 meters. Considering this resolution the number of parts (Np ) obtained from equation 10 is
25. And the number of cells per partition (N CP ) is 160000 (400x400).
However, if the map is 75Kmx75Km and the execution time is again 100 seconds, the
resolution obtained from Equation 8 is 35 meters, the number of parts is 53 and the number of
cells per partition is also 160000. So, this result shows that when the map area is larger than
a given value the map resolution must be reduced.
It can also be observed that when the map is large (75Kmx75Km) and the execution time
limit is short (20 seconds) it is necessary to adapt map resolution to larger values (64 meters)
and apply a partition in many parts (138 parts). In this case, the diﬀerence in forest ﬁre
propagation estimation is 0.178 which is too large. It means that in this case it is not feasible
to accomplish wind ﬁeld execution time and forest ﬁre propagation prediction diﬀerence. This
fact must be considered in order to identify the uncertainty in forest ﬁre propagation prediction.

Conclusions

Wind ﬁeld is a key issue to provide accurate forest ﬁre propagation prediction. However, for
real cases wind ﬁeld calculation involves solving very large systems and takes long time. In
real operation response time is critical and the wind ﬁeld calculation must accomplish strict
deadlines. To accomplish execution time it is necessary to limit the number of cells, and on
the other hand the number of parts must also be kept under certain limits. So, when the map
size is large, a new approach to accomplish both requirements consists in adapting the map
resolution. In this paper, we have developed a methodology to determine map resolution, the
number of parts and the number of cells per partition to accomplish time limitations without
increasing forest ﬁre propagation error. Results show that the methodology is consistent and
the resolution can be adapted successfully.
