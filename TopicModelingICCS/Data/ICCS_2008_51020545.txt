Abstract. We consider a three dimensional spatial network, where N
nodes are randomly distributed within a cube L × L × L. Each two nodes
are connected if their mutual distance does not excess a given cutoﬀ a.
We analyse numerically the probability distribution of the critical density
ρc = N (ac /L)3 , where one or more nodes become separated; ρc is found
to increase with N as N 0.105 , where N is between 20 and 300. The results
can be useful for a design of protocols to control sets of wearable sensors.
Keywords: random graphs; spatial networks; extreme values.

Introduction

Recent interest in abstract networks is at least partially due to the fact that
they are not bound by geometry. However, in many applications the networks
are embedded in a metric space; then we speak on spatial networks [1], geographical networks [2], ad-hoc networks [3] or random geometric graphs [4]. If
the connections between nodes are determined by their mutual distance, this
embedding appears to be important for the properties of the system. The list of
examples of spatial networks includes the Internet, the electriticity power grid,
transportation and communication networks and neuronal networks.
We consider a three dimensional spatial network, where N nodes are randomly
distributed within a cube L × L × L. Each two nodes are connected if their
mutual distance does not excess a given cutoﬀ a [1]. In the case of uniform
density of nodes the small-world property is absent, because the average shortest
path increases linearly with the system size L. Here the small world eﬀect could
appear in the case of unlimited dimensionality D of the network; once D is
ﬁxed, the eﬀect disappears. In literature, most papers are devoted to percolation
problems; references can be found in [1],[4,5,6]. The percolation threshold can
be identiﬁed with the critical density, where the size of the largest connected
component becomes of the order of the number of all nodes. Here we search
for another critical density, where the size of the largest connected component
becomes equal to the number of all nodes. In other words, we investigate the
critical spatial density where at least one node is unconnected. This kind of
threshold is diﬀerent than the one in the conventional percolation.
In our opinion, the problem can be relevant for control sets of wearable sensors
[7]. To give an example, a group of divers wants to keep contact, operating in

dark water. Their equipment secures communication between two divers only
if the distance between them is short enough. In this example, it is crucial to
maintain communication with all divers; no one can be lost. Having N divers,
how large volume of water can be safely penetrated?
The problem has its physical counterpart; we can ask about the largest ﬂuctuations of the density of an ideal gas. The probability distribution of this density
is usually assumed to be Gaussian [8]. Then we should ask about the probability that the minimal density in a gas of N particles is not lower than some
critical value proportional to a−3 . This question belongs to the statistics of extremes [9],[10]. However, the derivation of the Gaussian distribution itself relies
on the assumption that diﬀerent areas in the gas are statistically independent;
in real systems this is not true. Then it makes sense to investigate the problem
numerically.
In the next section we describe the details of our calculations and the results.
Short discussion in the last section closes the text.

Calculations and Results

A set of N points are randomly distributed with uniform probability in a cube
L × L × L. We set L = 4 and we vary a and N ; then the density is ρ = N (a/L)3 .
A link is set between each two nodes, if their mutual distance is less than a. The
simplest method is to generate the positions of the nodes and to vary the radius
a; for each a, the connectivity matrix is created and investigated.
We are interested in the critical density ρc , where some nodes become unconnected with the others. The simplest way is to calculate the percentage p of
isolated nodes per N ; if there is a phase transition, p could play a role of the
order parameter. The problem is that in this way, splittings of the network into

larger pieces is disregarded; the advantage is that the code works quickly and
larger networks can be investigated. In Fig. 1 we show N p as dependent on a
for N = 104 ; as we see, the variation is not sharp. Therefore we cannot decide if
there is a phase transition or just a crossover.
Other results are obtained for smaller lattices, but in each case the algorithm
detects the splitting of the whole network into pieces of any size. In Fig. 2 we
present the probability distribution of the critical density ρc for selected sizes of
the system. For each N , these results were obtained from 104 randomly generated

networks. In Fig. 3 we show the mean value of ρc , as it increases with the system
size N . This dependence appears to be very slow; it can be ﬁtted as proportional
to N 0.105 or, alternatively, as 1.336 + 0.265 × ln(N ).
We calculate also the network diameter d; this is the mean shortest path
between nodes, calculated as the number of links between them. Obviously, d
decreases with a, and it becomes inﬁnite when the network is disconnected. Thea

calculations are done with the Floyd algorithm [11], for a > ac . The results are
shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 5 reproduces the values of d at the threshold, where the
network splits.
In Fig. 6 we show the degree distribution of the network for N = 170 and
a = ac = 1.005. As we see, the distribution diﬀers from the Poisson distribution
and the log–normal distribution with the same mean degree. This diﬀerence may
be due to the correlations between numbers of nodes in diﬀerent spheres.

Discussion

It is obvious that the probability that at some point the density will be lower than
the critical value increases with the system size. This increase is compensated by
the decrease of the critical density and, subsequently, an increase of the critical
cutoﬀ with N . The question is how this cutoﬀ increases. The result shown in
Fig. 3 indicate, that this increase is rather slow. Our numerical method does
not allow us to diﬀer between the power law with a small exponent and the
logarithmic law.
The data of the mean free path d as dependent on a can be used to design protocols to communication between sensors. An example of such a protocol could
be that a signal ’zero’ detected by one sensor is sent to its neighbors which after a
time τ should reproduce it once, adding plus one to the content. The number when
the last sensor gets the signal is just the shortest path between this sensor and the
one which initialized the series. At the threshold density, the communication is
partially broken; high value of d near the threshold should activate the message
’go back to the others’ at these sensors which get the high value of the signal. Here,

the data shown in Fig. 5 can be useful. How to design routing protocols in ad hoc
networks is a separate branch of computer science [12].
In fact, our Monte Carlo simulations can be seen as an attempt to sample
the phase space of the system. The probability that the contact is broken can
be interpreted dynamically as the percentage of time when the communication
is incomplete. If the trajectory wanders randomly, all nodes can happen to be
connected again.
