Abstract. An Optimization model of pricing hydro-thermal trade is presented in
day-ahead market of electricity, which object is to maximize the social benefit
increment. And an algorithm of the model is given using heuristics algorithm.
Example indicates that the model and algorithm are feasible.
Keywords: Energy economics, Electricity market, Hydro-thermal trade.

1 Introduction
At present, the electric power industry of China is in the interim from planned
economy to market economy. In China, some investments of electric power
construction come from market but electricity market hasn’t been come into being
yet, which results that power enterprises are self-governed but the power grid is
monopolized. On that condition, the government confirms the electricity price and
quantity to grid of each power enterprise every year in order to ensure power
enterprises’ basic income. According to these data, the State Grid Corporation of
China contracts with power enterprises. In this way, every enterprise has contract
electric quantity, whatever hydropower or thermal, whatever efficient or inefficient.
So it often appears that thermal power enterprises are consuming coal to generate
electricity while some hydropower enterprises are spilling water [1].
Hydro-thermal trading is a measure to resolve this problem. Some experts also
have already started the research working on the problem [2-5]. Lanbing L. and
Chongqing K. et al. [2] presented the concept of generation right, whose emphasis
was trade mode. Jiangang Y. et al. [3] researched the generation rights trade, but
emphasized particularly on option. Yanling W. and Lizi Z. [4, 5] designed three kinds
of forms of generation right trade. All of the papers didn’t research the problem of
pricing hydro-thermal trade.
Based on the object of energy economics, an optimization model of pricing
hydro-thermal trading is bought forward aiming at day-ahead trade in the paper.
And we put forward an algorithm of the model by heuristics algorithm and give an
example.

2 Optimization Models of Pricing Hydro-thermal Trade
Suppose that there are n thermal power and m hydropower enterprises in one regional
electric market. Each participant’s goal is to maximize his profits increment. The dayahead trade is carried out on the day before the electric dispatching center dispatches
electric power (EDC) at the way of bidding. The EDC clears the uniform trading price
and corresponding electric quantity at the object of maximizing the social profits
increment.
2.1 Optimization Model of Day-Ahead Trade
In the day-ahead market, the model of maximizing the social profits increment is:
(P3)

max ΔFt = ∑t =1 ∑i =1 ∑ j =1 (c fit qijt − cejt qijt ) ,
l

n

m

s.t. q fit = a fit − b fit p fit ,
qejt = − aejt + bejt p fit ,
p fit = pejt = pt ,

∑

i =1

q fit = ∑ j =1 q ejt = ∑i =1 ∑ j =1 qijt ,

m

ce < pt < c f ,
q fit ≤ Q fit ,
Wejt + q ejt ≤ Qejt ,
where qfit is the purchasing electric quantity, pfit is the relevant price, afit and bfit are
coefficients of the demand function of thermal power enterprise i at t period of time.
qejt, pejt, aejt and bejt are the parameters of hydro-power enterprise j at t period of time.
qijt is the electric quantity that thermal power enterprise i purchases from hydropower
enterprise j at the price pt at t period of time. cfit is the average cost, qfit is the contract
electric quantity of thermal power enterprise i at t period of time. cejt is the variable
cost and Wejt is the contract electric quantity of hydropower enterprise j at t period of
time. And Qej is the maximal electric quantity that hydropower enterprise j is able to
produce at t period of time. l is the number of period of time. pt and qijt are decision
variables of (P1). i=1,2,…,n. j=1,2,…,m. t=1,2,…,l.
2.2 Algorithm
The optimization model (P1) is solved using heuristics algorithm and the flow of
solving (P1) is given in Fig. 1.

3 Example
Suppose that there are three thermal power and two hydropower enterprises who will
attend the hydro-thermal trade in one regional electricity market. We choose one
period of time of one day to compute. The bidding information is offered in the Tab. 1.
The trade results are given in the Tab. 2. From Table 2, we can see that the uniform
clearing price is 62.176 Yuan/MWh and 270.46MWh electric quantity is exchanged.

4 Conclusion
The hydro-thermal trade can make thermal power and hydropower enterprises gain
additional profits. And it can lessen water spill and decrease coal consume.
