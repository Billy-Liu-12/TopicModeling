Abstract. A bi-dimensional n-ary fragmentation model is numerically
studied by large-scale simulations. Its main assumptions are the existence
of random point Ô¨Çaws and a fracture mechanism based on the larger net
force. For the 4-ary fragment size distribution it was obtained a power
law with exponent 1.0 ‚â§ Œ≤ ‚â§ 1.15 . The visualizations of the model
resemble brittle material fragmentation.

Introduction

Fragmentation processes are complex multiphysics multiscale phenomena in Nature and Technology. Examples of fragmentation can be found in very large,
medium and microscopic scale. In refs. [8, 9] there is a enumeration of some natural fragment size distributions of high energetic instantaneous breaking. This
experimental evidence predicts a power-law behavior for small fragment masses,
with exponent in the range [1.44, 3.54]. Several models have been proposed to
explain this power-law behavior, see for instance refs. [2-7] .
In what follows the model is deÔ¨Åned and the numerical results discussed in
the case of 4-ary fragmentation.

DeÔ¨Ånition of the n-Ary Fragmentation Model

The hypothesis of the model are:
(a) Point Ô¨Çaws: The initial fragment is the unit square with q = 100 random
point Ô¨Çaws that remains Ô¨Åxed during the fragmentation process, see ref. [1].
(b) Fracture forces: For each fragment there are fracture forces (fx , fy ) that are
applied at random positions. They correspond to uniform and independent
distributed random numbers in [0, 1]. The fragmentation process is also selfsimilar, see for instance ref. [7].

(c) n-ary fragmentation: At each step all the fragments will be broken in n
fragments independently, like in a cascade process, unless they satisfy the
stopping condition (item (e)):
(c1) n2 Fragments are obtained from the application of the forces, i.e. the
fracture or cutting plane in this case is the plane perpendicular to the
random direction of the larger net force.
(c2) n2 Fragments are obtained due to the existence of Ô¨Çaws in the material.
The n4 cutting planes are the planes with normal perpendicular to the
line deÔ¨Åned by the point of application of the larger force and the position
of one of the n4 nearest point Ô¨Çaws.
(d) Mass conservation: The sum of the new fragments area will be the same of
the original fragment.
(e) Random stopping: There are three situations in which the fragmentation
process of a particular fragment stops:
(e1) If the fragment area is smaller than the minimal fragment size or cutoÔ¨Ä:
mf s .
(e2) With probability p, see refs. [4, 5, 6].
(e3) Every fragment has a resistance 0 ‚â§ r ‚â§ 1 to the breaking process. A
fragment breaks only if the maximum of the net forces acting on it is
greater than r. This parameter will be chosen uniform and constant.
The random stopping applies for fragments of area less or equal to the critical
area ac , introduced in order to represent the fact that greater fragments have
more probability to be broken than the smaller ones.

Numerical Results: 4-Ary Fragmentation

The methodology for the simulations was the following:
1) The parameters p, r, ac and mf s are chosen. During all the simulations the
value of q was Ô¨Åxed in 100.
2) The results were averaged over 5000 independent random initial conditions,
characterized by the fracture forces and the point Ô¨Çaws distribution.
3) It was chosen 4-ary fragmentation since it is the minimal even number to
produce non-binary fragmentation.
4) The fragmentation process evolves according to the rules (a) - (e) deÔ¨Åned in
section 2.
It was determined that the fragment area distribution f (s) follows approximately a power law distribution. The exponent of the power-law shows an increase with respect to [5] due to the 4-ary fragmentation and the point Ô¨Çaws
random distribution. The speciÔ¨Åc values of Œ≤ are shown in table 1:

Fig. 1. Fragmentation process evolution for diÔ¨Äerent set of parameters. First row: p =
r = 0.1, ac = 0.01, mf s = 0.0005. Second row: p = r = 0.1, ac = 0.01, mf s = 0.00005.
Third row: p = r = 0.15, ac = 0.01, mf s = 0.0005. Fourth row: p = r = 0.15, ac = 0.03,
mf s = 0.0005.

In Ô¨Ågure 1 is shown the fragmentation process evolution for diÔ¨Äerent sets
of parameters. The visualizations the model are very complex with patterns of
fracture that resemble real fragmentation processes in brittle materials like glass.
From Ô¨Ågure 1 it can be appreciated that:
1) If mf s decreases its value, the smaller fragment typical size decreases.
2) If p increases its value, the larger fragments frequency increases.
3) If ac increases its value, the larger fragments size increases.

Conclusions

In this work, it was numerically studied a model for n-ary fragmentation. The
main characteristic of this model is a fracture criterion based on the nearest
point Ô¨Çaw and maximal net force. By large-scale simulations, it was determined
an approximate power law behavior for the fragments area distribution. The visualizations of this dynamical system are very complex with patterns of fracture
that resemble real materials fragmentation.
