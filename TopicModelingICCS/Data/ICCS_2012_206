Abstract
In this paper, an eﬃcient and fast numerical method is studied and implemented for a simpliﬁed two-phase mixeddomain model of polymer exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC), which fully incorporates both the anode and
cathode sides, including the conservation equations of mass, momentum, water vapor concentration, liquid water
saturation and water content. The proposed numerical algorithm is based on the two-grid discretization technique, the
combined ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume method and some other appropriate linearization schemes. The original
nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations are only solved on the coarse grid while the ﬁne grid approximation solution
is obtained linearly. Therefore the computational time can be reduced tremendously compared with the traditional
one-grid method. Numerical experiments of the two-grid method and conventional method for a two-phase mixeddomain fuel cell model are carried out, showing that the presented method is eﬀective and accurate for the numerical
simulation of PEMFC.
Keywords: PEMFC, two-phase model, two-grid method, ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume method

1. Introduction
Numerical modeling and simulation have been an important tool for the design and optimization of polymer
exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC). Water management is a key issue in PEMFCs, and is a signiﬁcant technical
challenge. Suﬃcient water are needed in the membrane to maintain high proton conductivity, however, excess liquid
water in the electrode can cause water ﬂooding, and hinder the transport of the reactant from the gas channels to the
catalyst layers. To optimize water management, many approaches are used to simulate the multi-phase phenomenon
occurring in fuel cell, for which the multi-phase mixture (M 2 ) model [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and multi-ﬂuid model [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
are mainly developed. Recently, a mixed-domain model, which maintains a consistent treatment of water transport in
the membrane electrode assembly (MEA), has been developed in [11] based on the traditional two-ﬂuid model.
A fundamental fuel cell model consists of ﬁve principles of conservation: mass, momentum, species, charge,
and thermal energy. These complex nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) are formed by coupled nonlinear

relationship among the common Navier-Stokes equations and convection-diﬀusion-reaction equations. There is no
doubt that it is a huge challenge to solve this complex system of nonlinear PDEs in an eﬃcient and robust manner.
Comparing to the relatively plentiful literature on modeling and experimental study of fuel cells, there are less study
contributing to the numerical method of two-phase transport PEMFC model. P. Sun et al [12, 13, 14, 15, 16] lead
the ﬁeld in numerical studies for PEMFC due to their cutting edge work on the eﬃcient numerical methods for the
M 2 model of PEMFC. In [13], the streamline-diﬀusion and Galerkin-least-squares ﬁnite element methods are applied
to a 2D steady-state two-phase model in the cathode of PEMFC to get accurate physical solutions with fast convergence. Using Kirchhoﬀ transformation in [14], the numerical instability due to the discontinuous and degenerate
water diﬀusivity arising from M 2 model is overcome by a well developed Dirichlet-Neumann alternating iterative
domain decomposition method. The combined ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume method [13, 17, 16] is also used
in the numerical simulation to stabilize the dominant convection term in gas channels. However, the eﬀective numerical method for the multi-ﬂuid model of PEMFC is still far from satisfactory. The conventional method, such as
ﬁnite volume method, is commonly used in the numerical simulation for the multi-ﬂuid model [10, 11] based on the
commercial computational ﬂuid dynamic (CFD) software.
Two-grid method was originally developed by J. Xu in the literature [18, 19] to solve the nonsymmetric and
nonlinear elliptic boundary value problems. The algorithm gives the approximate solution of the original problem
on a coarse mesh ﬁrst, then the symmetric and linear part of the equation are modiﬁed on a ﬁne mesh. Theoretical
analysis also shows that the approximate solutions of the two-grid method have the same convergence rate with that
of one-grid method by directly solving diﬀerential equations on the ﬁne grid. Meanwhile, the computational cost is
greatly reduced [20, 21, 22]. The two-grid method has been successfully used for solving linear elliptic boundary value
problems, Stokes equation [23], the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations [24] and other partial diﬀerential equations.
Our goal in this paper is to explore and develop a two-grid algorithm for eﬃciently solving the coupled nonlinear
PDEs of the two-phase mixed-domain PEMFC model proposed by H. Meng in [11]. The rest of this paper is organized
as follows. Governing equations for a simpliﬁed two-phase mixed-domain model of PEMFC are introduced in Section
2. In Section 3, combining ﬁnite element method, upwind ﬁnite volume method and two-grid method, a new numerical
algorithm is designed to solve the proposed model. Numerical experiments of several practical cases are presented in
Section 4, showing that our developed numerical schemes signiﬁcantly improve the computational performance in the
senses of eﬃciency and lossless accuracy.
2. A two-phase mixed-domain model of PEMFC
Without considering the current collectors, a fuel cell is typically divided into seven subregions: the anode gas
channel (GC), anode gas diﬀusion layer (GDL), anode catalyst layer (CL), ionomeric membrane, cathode GC, cathode
GDL and cathode CL. On the basis of the traditional two-ﬂuid model, a 2D non-isothermal, mixed-domain, twophase model of PEMFC was ﬁrst studied in [11]. In this paper we restrict our model to isothermal case, investigate
the interactions among the principle physical solutions arising from the existing models, and reformulate the water
species equations to become a suitable strong PDE form for the purpose of ﬁnite element discretization.
2.1. Governing equations
Water management is critical to achieve high performance for PEMFC. As it is referred to as balancing membrane
hydration with ﬂooding avoidance, there are two conﬂicting needs: to hydrate the polymer electrolyte and to avoid
ﬂooding in porous electrodes and GDL for reactant/product transport [2]. Therefore, in order to focus on water
management topics, without loss of generality, we typically consider water as the only component in the following
simpliﬁed species concentration equation.
First, the conservation equations of mass, momentum and water species concentrations in the gaseous phase are
established as [2, 11].
Mass and momentum conservation. The generic mass and momentum conservation equations, valid for all fuel
cell components except current collectors and membrane, can be written for water vapor ﬂow as

considering the liquid water eﬀect, Dewf f , the eﬀective gaseous species diﬀusion coeﬃcients, namely the constant
diﬀusivity in gaseous water region, is further deﬁned as Dewf f = Dw (1 − s)1.5 . In the catalyst layers, the water phase is
assumed to be in thermodynamic phase equilibrium with water vapor, and its transport process is considered based on
the ”ﬁctitious water concentration” treatment [25, 26] using the following water diﬀusivity [11]

where the condensation/evaporation parameter h pc and partial pressure of water vapor pv are determined in Table 1.
In this two-phase model, the liquid water transport is taken into account using the traditional two-ﬂuid method to
add the ﬂexibility for studying the ﬁnite-rate condensation/evaporation processes [11]. In the following, the conservation equations of liquid water are presented.

the subdomains checked by ” ” shall the corresponding unknown be necessarily computed, otherwise, the unknown

where u1 |inlet , speciﬁed as a parabolic-like function, is given in (25).

To deﬁne ﬁnite element discretizations for the governing equations (1), (2), (4), (12) and (13), we shall derive their
weak forms ﬁrst in terms of the corresponding boundary conditions.
Let Ω be the computational domain, shown in Fig.1, and deﬁne
V := {v = (v1 , v2 ) ∈ [H 1 (Ω)]2 | v1 |(∂Ω)1 ∪(∂Ω)2 = u1 |inlet , v2 |(∂Ω)1 ∪(∂Ω)2 = 0},

3.2. Two-grid method
Let Th be a rectangular partition of Ω with the maximum mesh size h. S h = Vh ×Ph ×Qh ×Xh ×Zh ⊂ V ×P×Q×X×Z
and S h = Vh × Ph × Qh × Xh × Zh ⊂ V × P × Q × X × Z be the piecewise bilinear ﬁnite element spaces.
In comparison to the relatively small diﬀusion coeﬃcients, the convection coeﬃcients arising in momentum and
concentration equations are dominant due to large ﬂow in the gas channel, which inevitably induces numerical instability and oscillating solution. It is crucial to design a robust numerical scheme to eﬃciently solve convection-dominated
diﬀusion equations. To combine the advantages of both upwind ﬁnite volume scheme and ﬁnite element method, and
conquer the dominant convection eﬀect in the framework of ﬁnite element approach, we employ a combined ﬁnite
element-upwind ﬁnite volume method [28, 29, 14] for the PEMFC model in this section, where a ﬁnite volume based
ﬁnite-diﬀerence upwind scheme is adopted to speciﬁcally deal with dominant convection term only, meanwhile, all
the other terms are still discretized by ﬁnite element method.

Since the two-grid algorithm only solve the nonlinear equations on the coarse grid and solve the linear equations
on the ﬁne grid, the computational cost of nonlinear iteration is greatly reduced, which validated by the following
numerical experiments.
4. Numerical results
In this section, we carry out the following numerical experiments which indicate that our methods are eﬀective and
fast to deal with PEMFC simulation. It is well known that the ﬂow proﬁle is parabolic under steady ﬂow conditions
once laminar ﬂow is fully developed in long and straight channel. Based on this fact, in the following numerical
experiments, we assign the Dirichlet boundary condition of velocity at the inlet as follows
u1 |inlet =

at cathode inlet (∂Ω)2
uin,c sin(yπ/δCH )
uin,a sin((y − δca )π/δCH ) at anode inlet (∂Ω)1

0 ≤ y ≤ δCH ,

(25)

where δca = δCH + δGDL + δCL + δmem .
Since the liquid water has a slight motion exists in channel width direction and increases along channel direction
[5], we assume the liquid water along channel has a linear change, from the minimum value to the maximum value.
sCH,GDL = 0.1(lcell − x)/lcell + 0.2x/lcell .

(26)

In order to verify the correctness and eﬃciency of our two-grid numerical solutions, we compute the relative
error of mass balance and simulation time with the boundary condition of uin,a = 5 m/s, uin,c = 3 m/s, Cin,a =
10 mol/m3 , Cin,c = 12 mol/m3 compared with the conventional ﬁnite element method in our following simulations.
And the tolerance of our stopping criteria (23) for iteration is 10−8 . An example of a coarse and a ﬁne mesh size for
the two-grid method is present in Fig.3. And Table 4 shows that our two-grid method can cut down the compute time
dramatically with non-losing accuracy.

Figure 3: An example of coarse grid (left) and ﬁne grid (right) for two-grid method
Fig. 4 show the velocity ﬁeld in anode and cathode of fuel cell produced by the two-grid method and the conventional method, which shows the same numerical results completely. As expected, there is a large diﬀerence in the
velocity scale between the porous media and the open channel. The velocity in porous GDL is at least two orders of
magnitude smaller than that in the open gas channel, indicating that gas diﬀusion is the dominant transport mechanism
in porous GDL. Porous CL has a smaller velocity than GDL due to the inferior diﬀusion ability.
Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the contours of the vapor water concentration and liquid water saturation in cathode
respectively. Due to water production by fuel cell, a small amount of liquid water emerges downstream, i.e., liquid

water saturation s > 0 there, and the ﬂow in the diﬀusion layer shifts to gas water multiphase ﬂow. Once liquid water
is being created by condensation, it is dragged into the GDL by the gas phase, the liquid water can only exit the GDL
through the build-up of a capillary pressure gradient to overcome the viscous drag. So the liquid saturation increased
inside the GDL.

Fig. 7 displays the water content in the membrane, which clearly shows that the water content increases from the
inlet to the outlet region in the along-channel direction, presenting a complete picture of the water content variation
inside the membrane.

5. Conclusions
In this paper, based on the combined ﬁnite element-upwind ﬁnite volume methods and the two-grid method, a
new discretization scheme is designed and implemented for a simpliﬁed two-phase 2D mixed-domain fuel cell model.
Numerical experiments demonstrate that our methods are able to solve the governing equations with less compute

time, and obtain a relatively accurate numerical solution with low mass balance error. The two-grid method will
greatly decrease the computational amount, and improve the computing speed and accuracy for 3D PEMFC model,
therefore the two-grid method for 3D two-phase mixed-domain complete model will be studied in our future work.
