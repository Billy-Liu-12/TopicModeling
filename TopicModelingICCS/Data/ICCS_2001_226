Abstract. The problem of dynamic maintenance of the Voronoi diagram for a set of spheres moving independently in d-dimensional space
is addressed in this paper. The maintenance of the generalized Voronoi
diagram of spheres, moving alone the given trajectories, requires the calculation of topological events, that occur when d + 2 spheres become
tangent to a common sphere. The criterion for determination of such a
topological event for spheres in the Euclidean metric is presented. This
criterion is given in the form of polynomial algebraic equations dependent on the coordinates and trajectories of the moving spheres. These
equations are normally solved using numerical methods.

Introduction

Such areas as motion planning, computer simulation of physical systems,
robotics and computer graphics often deal with geometric objects that move
with time [12]. In many applied problems from these areas, collection of
geometric objects such as points, disks and spheres, is often considered. Objects
can be given along with the analytic functions describing their motion, often
speciﬁed by polynomials of time. The aim in these problems is to answer questions concerning properties of the system of objects, for instance, ﬁnding the
closest/furthest pair, predicting the next collision or computing the minimum
enclosing circle.
The static Voronoi diagram is often employed by for solving the above problems.
Extensive libraries of methods for Voronoi diagram construction, maintenance
and querying have been developed over time [14,4]. Weighted Voronoi diagrams
for a set of circles in the plane have been introduced and their properties
have been studied [2,17,9,8,13]. For the dynamic Voronoi diagram of a set of
moving points in the plane only a few algorithms are known. These include
computation of the moment in time when the convex hull of algebraically
moving points reaches a steady state [1], construction and maintenance of the
dynamic Voronoi diagram [7], estimation of upper and lower bounds on the
number of combinatorial changes to the diagram over time [15] and solving
query problems on the set of moving points [3].
Finally, the problem of construction and maintenance of the dynamic Voronoi
diagram for a set of moving objects other than points has rarely been addressed
in the literature. Some of the works in this ﬁeld were devoted to the construction
of the dynamic Voronoi diagram for a set of moving hyper-rectangles [11],

[5] and computation of the time of the topological event in the dynamic
Euclidean Voronoi diagram for a set of circles and line segments [10]. In this
paper, we extend the result reported in [10] to address the problem of dynamic
maintenance of the weighted Euclidean Voronoi diagram for moving spheres
in d-dimensional space. An important property of the weighted generalized
Voronoi diagram in the Euclidean metric, limiting the number of inscribed
spheres, is also established. Based on this result, a criterion to determine the
time of the topological event in the Euclidean metric is derived in the form of a
system of polynomial algebraic equations.

Deﬁnitions

Consider a set S of n moving spheres in Rd . Each sphere moves along a given
trajectory, described by a function of time. The spheres move in unbounded
d-dimensional space. The Voronoi diagram can be used as a data structure to
store the topological information about the system of moving objects as well as
to answer queries. It is deﬁned as:
Deﬁnition 1. The Voronoi diagram for a set of objects S in d-dimensional
space is a partitioning of the space into regions, such that each region is the
locus of points from S closer to the object P ∈ S than to any other object
Q ∈ S, Q �= P .
The above general deﬁnition can be specialized to the set of spheres in the
Euclidean metric [14]:
Deﬁnition 2. A generalized Euclidean Voronoi diagram (GVD) for a set
of sites S in Rd is the set of Voronoi regions {x ∈ Rd |d(x, P ) ≤ d(x, Q),
∀Q ∈ S − {P }}, where d (x, P ) is the Euclidean distance function between a
point x and a site P ∈ S.
Following the classiﬁcation of generalized Voronoi diagrams presented in [14]
the Euclidean weighted Voronoi diagram is an instance of the class of additively
weighted Voronoi diagrams, where d(x, P ) = d(x, p) − rp (see Fig. 1). The
distance d(x, p) between points x(x1 , x2 , ...,
�xd ) and p(p1 , p2 , ..., pd ) in the
d
�
(xi − yi )2 . According to the
Euclidean metric is computed as d(x, y) =
i=1

deﬁnition, the generalized Voronoi region of an additively weighted Voronoi
diagram of n sites is obtained as the intersection of n − 1 quasi-halfspaces
with hyperbolic boundaries. It was shown in [14] that the weighted Euclidean
Voronoi diagram for a set of spheres is the set of singly-connected Voronoi
regions with the hyperbolic boundaries, star-shaped relative to site P .
The straight-line dual to the Voronoi diagram called a Delaunay tessellation is
often used instead of the Voronoi diagram to store topological information for
a set of sites:
Deﬁnition 3. A generalized Delaunay tessellation corresponding to a generalized Voronoi diagram for a set of spheres S in d-dimensional space is a
collection of d-dimensional simplices such that for each generalized Voronoi

(p1 , p2 , . . . , pd+1 ) in the generalized Delaunay tessellation.
Fig. 1 represents the Voronoi diagram in the Euclidean metric and the
corresponding Delaunay triangulation for four circles in the plane.
In this paper, we ﬁrst establish the property that the number of inscribed
spheres in the Euclidean metric for d + 1 spheres in general positions can be
either two, one or zero. Following this, the conditions for the topological swap
in the generalized Euclidean Voronoi diagram in d-dimensions are derived.

Dynamic Generalized Euclidean VD
Swap Operation in the Euclidean Metric

Consider the problem of maintaining the ordinary dynamic Voronoi diagram
in the plane over some period of time. According to Roos [15], a dynamic
Voronoi diagram undergoes two types of changes. The ﬁrst type is a continuous
deformation, where the locations of vertices and lengths of Voronoi edges can
change, while proximity relationship between Voronoi sites do not change. The
second type of change is the topological change, when Voronoi edges appear
and disappear. The discrete moments of time when such change can happen are
called topological events.
In order to detect such topological events the Delaunay triangulation is often
used. Consider ﬁrst the ordinary Voronoi diagram. When four moving sites in a
quadrilateral, comprising two neighboring triangles of the Delaunay triangulation become cocircular, the corresponding edge of the Voronoi diagram gradually
shrinks to zero and then a new edge appears. The corresponding diagonal in a
quadrilateral in the Delaunay triangulation is ﬂipped (this operation sometimes
called a swap operation) and the future topological events for the newly created
quadrilaterals are detected. The conditions for the topological event for Voronoi
diagram in the Laguerre geometry and under the Euclidean distance function
were established in [13,10]. The d-dimensional swap operation is described in

Now, let us consider the topological event in the Euclidean metric. By the
dynamic generalized Euclidean Voronoi diagram (referred to as the Euclidean
Voronoi diagram in sequel) we mean the generalized Voronoi diagram in the
Euclidean metric for a set of sites moving independently along the given
trajectories. The topological event in the Euclidean metric can be illustrated
on the following example. Consider a case when two circles P1 and P3 move
towards each other along the straight-line trajectory in the direction shown by
arrows (see Fig. 2(a)). Assume for simplicity that other two circles P2 and P4
remain in their spatial positions. At some moment of time t four circles become
cocircular and the edge between sites P2 and P4 is reduced to zero. As the
circles P1 and P3 continue to move toward each other, the new edge between
sites P1 and P3 appears and its length increases with time (Fig. 2(b)). The
topology of the Euclidean Voronoi diagram changes. The corresponding changes
in the Euclidean Delaunay triangulation are shown in Fig. 2 by dashed lines.
The following conclusions can be drawn from the above discussion. First,
for a ﬁnite set of sites S the topological structure of the Euclidean Voronoi
diagram is locally stable, i.e. only continuous deformations take place, under
suﬃciently small continuous motion of sites. Secondly, the topological changes
in the structure of the Euclidean Voronoi diagram are characterized by swaps of
adjacent triangles (tetrahedrons) in the Delaunay triangulation (tessellation).

3.2

Dynamic Euclidean Voronoi Diagram Maintenance

The algorithm for maintenance of the Voronoi diagram for n circles, presented
in [10], is now extended to handle the d-dimensional case.
1. (Preprocessing) Construct the Delaunay tessellation for the original site
distribution. For every existing d-dimensional quadrilateral (quadrilateral
formed by d + 2 neighboring spheres) in the Delaunay tessellation calculate

On Dynamic Generalized Voronoi Diagrams

the next topological event. Insert all such events into the event priority queue
sorted according to the time order.
2. (Iteration) Take the next topological event from the event queue. Update the
Delaunat tessellation corresponding to the d-dimensional swap operation
3. Delete all topological events from the event queue, planned for no longer
existing d-dimensional quadrilaterals.
4. Compute the new topological events for all new d-dimensional quadrilaterals
and insert them into the event queue.
Preprocessing step requires O(n�d/2�+1 ) time (see [6,16], for example). The
swap operation takes O(1) time, insertion to the queue in sorted order requires
O(log n) time, and deletion from the queue takes O(1) time when for each
d-dimensional quadrilateral we store pointers on the events scheduled for this
quadrilateral. The maximum size of the queue is O(n�d/2� ), since there is at most
one event scheduled at any moment of time for each quadrilateral. The space
required to store the tessellation is O(n�d/2� ). The total number of topological
events depends on the trajectories of the moving sites and the elapsed time
(upper bounds estimates were obtained for certain types of trajectories in [15]).
The above is now summarized.
Lemma 1. The algorithm for maintenance of the Voronoi diagram for a set of
sites in plane takes O(n�d/2�+1 ) preprocessing time, O(n�d/2� ) space and each
topological event uses O(d log n) time.
To determine the time of the topological event, or the moment when d + 2
Voronoi sites are co-spherical, it is required to ﬁnd the minimal root t 0 of
the equation IN CIRCLE(P1 , P2 , ..., Pd+2 ) = 0. In the above, Pi = Pi (t),
i = 1..d + 2 are the coordinates of the d + 2 moving spheres, where t denotes the
time. The form of the IN CIRCLE function depends on the metric being used.
If the value of the IN CIRCLE function is positive then the empty-sphere
condition is satisﬁed, when it is equal to zero, then the topological event occurs.
It was shown that in the planar case the IN CIRCLE function in power metric
can be computed as a 4 × 4 determinant [9] and that in Euclidean metric it can
be represented as a 6th degree polynomial of time [10]. Now, let us consider the
generalization to d-dimensions under the Euclidean metric.

3.3

The Number of Inscribed Spheres in the Euclidean Metric

Let Pi = {pi = (xi1 , xi2 , ..., xid ) , ri } , i = 1..d+1 be d+1 spheres in d-dimensional
space. We will show how to obtain the coordinates and the radius of an inscribed
sphere C = {ξ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , ..., ξd ) , ρ} and establish the number of such spheres. Let
us ﬁrst formally deﬁne the sphere inscribed among the d + 1 spheres in the
d-dimensional space.

678

M.L. Gavrilova and J. Rokne

Deﬁnition 4. A sphere C = {ξ, ρ} inscribed among d+1 spheres P1 , P2 , ..., Pd+1
is a sphere with center ξ = (ξ1 , ξ2 , ..., ξd ) and radius ρ, such that ρ = d (ξ, P1 ) =
d (ξ, P2 ) = ... = d (ξ, Pd+1 ).
Now, let us reduce the values of the radii of the d + 1 spheres by the radius of
the smallest sphere. Without loss of generality assume that the smallest sphere
has index d + 1. Let us deﬁne a coordinate system with the center of coordinates
at point pd+1 . Then the transformed coordinates of the given spheres are Pi∗ =
{p∗i = (x∗i1 , x∗i2 , ..., x∗id ) , ri∗ } , i = 1..d, where x∗ij = xij − xd+1,j , i, j = 1..d , and
ri∗ = ri − rd+1 . The last sphere is transformed into a point at the origin of
coordinates. The unknown inscribed sphere coordinates will change to ξj∗ =
ξj − xd+1,j , j = 1..d, and ρ∗ = ρ + rd+1 .
We will use the fact that the coordinates of the inscribed sphere satisfy the
equations
(1)
d (ξ ∗ , p∗i ) = ρ∗ + ri∗ , i = 1..d + 1.
Expanding the distance function, we get:
� ∗

∗ 2
∗ 2
∗ 2
∗ 2
(ξ1 ) + (ξ2 ) + ... + (ξd ) = (ρ )

(2)

The last equation can be subtracted from the remaining equations to cancel the
quadratic terms

where wi∗ = (x∗i1 ) + (x∗i2 ) + ... + (x∗id ) − (ri∗ ) , i = 1..d.
The solution for this system can be obtained by the following steps. The ﬁrst d
equations are linear in (ξ1 , ξ2 ..., ξd , ρ) . This linear system has d equations and
d + 1 variables. Denote the matrix of the system by A, the column of unknowns
by x and the right-hand side column by b.
The following three cases are possible:
Case 1. rank(A) = rank(A|b) = d.
This is the general case. The linear system can be resolved for d of the variables
leaving one of the variables as a free parameter. To determine which variable is
left free, a variable that can be moved into the right-hand side of the system
must be found so that the determinant of the remaining system is non-zero.
Thus, a non-zero [d × d] minor of matrix A must be found. Assume that ξk∗ is
left as a free variable. The remaining unknowns will all be linear functions of
ξk∗ . They can be substituted into the last equation, which turns into a quadratic
equation for ξk∗ . It can have two, one or no real solutions. Consequently, the
following statement is true:
Lemma 2. The number of inscribed spheres in the Euclidean metric for a given
d + 1 spheres in d-dimensional space in general positions (i.e. rank(A) = d) can
be either two, one or zero.
Note that even though the system can have up to two solutions, only those
where the radius of the inscribed sphere is positive should be selected. Also

note that each of the inscribed spheres corresponds to a distinct Delaunay
tetrahedron in the Delaunay tessellation.
Case 2. rank(A) = rank(A|b) < d.
In this case, the linear system has an inﬁnite number of solutions, and,
consequently, inﬁnitely many inscribed spheres. An example of such a system is
given in Fig. 3.
Case 3. rank(A) < rank(A|b) ≤ d.
In this case, the linear system has no solutions, and consequently, there are no
inscribed spheres. An example of such a system is presented in Fig. 4.
Note that cases 2 and 3 both represent degenerate sphere arrangements, because
the spheres are linearly dependent when rank(A) < d.

3.4

Topological Event Computation

Now, let us obtain the formulas to compute the topological event in the Euclidean
tessellation of moving sites. Let Pi = {(xi = xi (t), yi = yi (t)) , ri }, i = 1..d + 2
be a set of spheres with centers (xi (t) , yi (t)) given by analytic functions of time
and radii ri .
Theorem 1. The time of the topological event in a Delaunay d-dimensional
quadrilateral of d + 2 spheres Pi = {(xi = xi (t), yi = yi (t)) , ri }, can be found as
the minimum real root t0 of the equation
A21 + A22 + ... + A2d = A2d+1 ,

Proof.
The IN CIRCLE function for d + 2 spheres can be obtained by determining
the coordinates of the inscribed sphere(s) for the ﬁrst d + 1 spheres, and then
computing the distance from the last sphere to the inscribed sphere(s):
IN CIRCLE(P1 , ..., Pd+2 ) = ρ−d(ξ, Pd+2 ). In the Euclidean metric, this formula
is transformed to:

where (ξ1 , ξ2 ..., ξd , ρ) are the coordinates of the sphere inscribed among the
spheres P1 , P2 , ..., Pd+1 .
The condition can be rewritten as the following system of equations:
d (pi , ξ) = ri + ρ, i = 1..d + 2.

(6)

Performing transformations similar to those described above reduces the radii of
all spheres by the radius of the smallest sphere (assume that this is the (d + 2)nd sphere). The origin of the coordinates is moved to the center of the smallest
sphere. Denote x∗ij = xij − xd+2,j and di ∗ = di − dd+2 .
Then the second-degree terms in the ﬁrst d + 1 equations can be cancelled

Note that all coordinates are analytical functions of time. When the spheres

an 8th degree polynomial of time. As the spheres move with time, (10) and (11)
can be written as
f (t) = 0
(12)
ρ=

g(t) > 0

(13)

Note that the function f (t) is in general non-zero. The ﬁrst t0 satisfying f (t0 ) = 0
and the condition (13) represents the ﬁrst topological event encountered. The
complexity of the solution of (12) and (13) for t0 clearly depends on the nature of
the functions describing the movements of the circles. Even if these functions are
linear, solving f (t) = 0 reduces to ﬁnding the zeros of a high degree polynomial
of time. This will require an iterative numerical method, for example Newton’s
method.

Conclusion

Criterion for determination of the time of topological event in a Voronoi diagram
for moving spheres in d-dimensions has been presented. The results are given
in an algebraic form and can be applied to compute the dynamic generalized
Voronoi diagram in the Euclidean metric.
