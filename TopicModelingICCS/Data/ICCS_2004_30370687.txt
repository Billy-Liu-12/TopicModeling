Abstract. A PID Controller has been used to operate this system because of its
implementational advantages. However, it is very difficult to achieve an optimal PID gain with no experience, since the gain of the PID controller has to be
manually tuned by trial and error. This paper focuses on tuning of the PID
Controller with disturbance rejection using immune network algorithm. To decide the performance of response, an ITSE (Integral of time weighted squared
error) is used in this paper.

1 Introduction
The normal power plant operation requires tracking the steam demand while maintaining the steam pressure and the steam temperature of at their respective setpoints,
despite variations of the steam load. However, if the overall system is to be driven to
an operating point different from the design point, the interaction variables are very
likely to vary from their design values. Therefore, the local controllers need to be
robust in order to accommodate these variations. Up to now, a Proportional–Integral–
Derivative (PID) controller has been used in the control system of power plant. However, it cannot effectively control such a complicated or fast running system, since the
response of a plant depends on only the gain P, I, and D. In this paper, an intelligent
tuning method by a immune algorithm is suggested for robust control with disturbance rejection on control system of power plant.

2 Control Characteristics of Thermal Power Plant for Controller
Design
A thermal power plant is mainly composed of one boiler whose steam output feeds
one or two turbine, driving an electric generator. There can be many available models
for each subsystem with a varying degree of complexity and accuracy. The models

The performance index defined as ITSE (Integral of the Time-Weighted Square of the

Because E(s) contains the parameters of the controller (c), the value of performance
index, PI for a system of nth order can be minimized by adjusting the vector c as
min PI (c ) , The optimal tuning is to find the vector c, such that the ITSE performance

constraint be max(α (ω , ci )) 0.5 . The value of the fitness of each individual of memory
cell ω j ( j = 1,..., m) is determined by the evaluation function, denoted by Ω(ω j ) as
Ω(ω j ) = α (ω , ci ) .

The penalty for the individual

ci is calculated by means of the pen-

alty function Φ(ci ) given by

{

Φ (ci ) M 2 if ci is unstable, M 1 max(ω , ci ) if max(α (ω , ci )) 0.5 〉 δ , 0 if max(α (ω , ci )) 0.5 〈 δ .

3.4 Computational Procedure for Optimal Selection of Parameter
[Step 1.] Initialization and recognition of antigen: That is, initialize the populations of
network ci (i = 1,..., n) and memory cell ω j ( j = 1,..., m) .
[Step 2.] Product of antibody from memory cell: For each individual ci of the network population, calculate the maximum value of a(ω, ci ) using memory cell. If no
individuals of the network satisfy the constraint max(a(ω , ci )) 0.5 < δ ,
[Step 3.] Calculation for searching a optimal solution: Calculate the fitness value for
each individual ci .

[Step 4.] Stimulation and suppression of antibody: The expected value η k of the
stimulation of the antibody is given by η k = mϕk σ k ,where σ k is the concentration of
the antibodies. Through this function, for each individual ci of the network, calculate
max(a (ω , ci )) using memory cell, and initialize the gene of each individual
ω j ( j = 1,..., m) in the population.
