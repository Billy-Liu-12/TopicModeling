In diffuse interface models of phase transformation phenomena such as the phase field
method, the phase boundary is described by a continuous function, the phase field φαβ , which
varies smoothly from a constant value (often chosen to be φαβ = 0) in the bulk phase α to
another constant value (φαβ = 1) in the bulk β-phase. For simplicity, we restrict the discussion
in this work to the boundary between two phases only, so that the index pair αβ becomes
unique and can thus be omitted for the sake of simplicity of notation. As will be shown in
the next section, when a diffuse interface is used, the curvature of a phase boundary can be
expressed essentially as the difference of the Laplacian, ∆φ, and a second gradient-type term.
In phase field simulations of microstructure evolution, this second term is usually replaced by
a local expression in terms of the phase field function itself with no need for gradient evaluation [7, 5, 6, 8]. It is generally accepted that this replacement leads to a more accurate result for
the second term. It is the purpose of the present work to show that this replacement leads to
a larger error in curvature evaluation as compared to a simple centered difference based calculation. The main rational behind this behavior will be elucidated via analytic error estimates.
It will be shown that the errors in the Laplacian and in the second term exhibit roughly the
same spatial dependence across the interface. This opens the possibility of a cancellation of
error, a feature explored successfully also in other contexts. Two examples are the approach
by Paul Dellar in simple BGK-lattice Boltzmann method, where the errors from the discrete
collisions and the splitting into streaming and collision cancel [9] and a model for multiphase
flows by Kupershtokh, Medvedev and Karpov, where the potential gradient is split into two
expressions and, for each equation of state, a specific factor is introduced to ensure cancellation
of errors [10]. However, if the second term in κ is evaluated exactly, the error in the Laplacian
remains uncompensated and solely determines the numerical uncertainty in the local curvature.
Interestingly, the error in Laplacian shows an antisymmetric variation across the interface.
Thus, its integral over the interface cancels out. Thanks to this property, the interface-averaged
curvature is insensitive to the way the second term is calculated.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, the issue of curvature between two phases
separated by a diffuse boundary, φ, is briefly reviewed. Section 3 deals with numerical results
and discussion thereof. A summary concludes the manuscript. An appendix contains details of
the derivation regarding the analytic error analysis

Curvature determination

The local curvature of a surface can be defined as the divergence of its normal vector, n,
κ = ∇ · n.

(1)

Within the phase field method [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the unit vector normal to the interface is given by
n = ∇φ/|∇φ|. Substituting this into Eq. (1), the expression for curvature becomes

An alternative expression for the local curvature can be obtained within the phase
 field method.
For this purpose, one starts from the free energy functional of the model, F = V [W 2 |∇φ|2 /2 +
f (φ)]d3 r, where f (φ) is the free energy density and W is a characteristic interface thickness.
Sufficiently close to equilibrium, the time evolution of the phase field variable φ is obtained via
the dissipative ansatz, τ ∂φ/∂t = −δF/δφ. This leads to

where f ′ (φ) = ∂f (φ)/∂φ and τ is a relaxation constant. In order to arrive at an expression for
curvature, we invoke the Gibbs-Thomson equation in the absence of a driving force,
0 = −µκ − vn ,

(4)

where µ denotes the interface mobility and vn = v · n is the normal component of the interface
velocity. Seeking a comparison with Eq. (3), the velocity vn in the Gibbs-Thompson equation
(4) is rewritten in terms of the time derivative of φ. This is achieved by first noting that the
phase field obeys the advection equation, ∂φ/∂t+v·∇φ = 0. Using v·∇φ = v·n|∇φ| = vn |∇φ|,
this can be rewritten as ∂φ/∂t = −vn |∇φ|. Multiplying Eq. (4) with |∇φ| and using this last
relation, one finds
∂φ
= µκ|∇φ|.

(6)

A comparison of Eqs. (2) and (6) shows that W and τ cannot be chosen independently but
must obey the relation W 2 = µτ . A nice feature of Eq. (6) is that the gradient expression in the
second term of κ can be obtained locally from f ′ (φ) without any need for the information on
neighboring points. The error associated with this term can thus be largely avoided. However,
as will be shown below, this also precludes the cancellation of the error caused by the Laplacian
in the first term of κ, which then dominates the numerical error in the local curvature.

Numerical results

In order to highlight the above ideas, we choose a test case for which an exact expression for
curvature can be obtained. A circular disk of radius R of phase 1 surrounded by a phase 2
(Fig. 1). The most general form of the phase field φ connecting these two phases then reads
φ(r) ≡ φ(|r|) ≡ φ(r).

(7)

Interestingly, this information is sufficient to determine the curvature of the interface separating the two phases. To see this, we note that ∇φ = (∂φ/∂r)∇r = (∂φ/∂r)r/r and thus
n = r/r. Inserting this information into Eq. (1), the curvature for the present test case is
obtained,

In Eq. (8), d is the dimension of space, which is set to d = 2 in the present study. This exact
result will be used to estimate the error associated with a numerical evaluation of curvature.
Although the above exact result does not require any specific knowledge of φ except its radial
dependence, the shape of φ must be known to compute κ numerically using either Eq. (2) or (6).
To proceed further along this line, we note that the equilibrium shape of the phase field variable
φ depends on the potential function f (φ). Here, two typical choices shall be considered. For the
double well potential, f (φ) = φ2 (1 − φ)2 , one obtains by minimizing the free energy functional
for the case of a planar interface,

phases are separated by a diffuse interface, shown in blue. The angle between the interface

choices of f (φ) as a double well (tanh-profile) and a double obstacle (sin-profile) potential.

where r is the variable which varies along the direction normal to the interface and R marks
the interface-mid-point. Note that, strictly speaking, Eq. (9) is valid at equilibrium for a planar
interface. In our numerical test-case, however, we will assume acircular shape for the phase
1 so that the resulting curvature is non-zero. In this case, r = (x − x0 )2 + (y − y0 )2 is the
distance from disk center and R is the disk radius. It is important to note that, for a circular
body, the exact shape of φ is in general different from the above tanh profile but the deviations
are small as long as R is large compared to W . As seen from our studies, a choice of R = 10W is
sufficient to make this approximation quite accurate. Similarly, the choice of a double obstacle
potential, f (φ) = |φ||1 − φ|, leads to [5]

(10)

With these choices, one obtains f ′ (φ) = 2φ(1 − φ)(1 − 2φ) for the case of double well and
f ′ (φ) = 1 − 2φ for the double obstacle potentials. In evaluating curvature via Eq. (2), only the
information about φ is used. In contrast to this, when using Eq. (6), one needs both φ(r) and
the corresponding f ′ (φ).
The results obtained from Eqs. (2) and (6) for the case of a double well potential are shown
in Fig. 2a for θ = 0, where θ denotes the angle of the vector normal to the interface with
the x-axis (see Fig. 1a). The error in Eq. (6) is quite large while Eq. (2) shows a behavior
close to the exact result, 1/r. To analyze the origin of this behavior, we evaluate the spatial
dependence of the numerical error associated with the Laplacian and the second term in Eq. (2).
Figure 2b illustrates that these two errors are very similar and thus cancel largely each other.
This canceling of errors is prevented if the second term is replaced by f ′ (φ) as done in Eq. (6).
Figure 2b also compares the numerical results on error terms in Eq. (2) with the corresponding analytic estimates, obtained by a Taylor expansion of the underlying finite difference
scheme. Denoting the error in the Laplacian by Err1 and that of the second term by Err2, this

f and g appearing above are given as f (x, y) = φ2x φxx +φ2y φyy +2φx φy φxy and g(x, y) = φ2x +φ2y .
A detailed derivation of Eqs. (11) and (12) is given in the appendix. It must be noted
here that no finite difference scheme is employed when evaluating Eqs. (11) and (12). Rather,
we use φ given by Eqs. (9) and (10) for the corresponding potentials. As shown in Fig. 2b,
the analytic error estimates are in excellent agreement with the numerical data. The analysis
is substantiated further by a survey of the local curvature evaluated along directions which
are not aligned with the underlying grid. Due to the symmetry of the selected example, it is
sufficient to select angles 0 < θ < π/2. Not quite unexpectedly, we observe the largest angular
dependence for the numerical error for case of θ = π/4. Results are shown in Fig. 2c,d. Even
though the cancellation of errors is not as striking as for θ = 0, Eq. (2) still provides a more

accurate result on local curvature than Eq. (6).
The above analysis is repeated for the case of double obstacle potential. The equilibrium
interface profile resulting from this choice is given in Eq. (10). Results for this case are depicted
in Fig. 3 and reveal a trend similar to that of the double well potential.
The observation that the cancellation of errors is practically perfect for the case of θ = 0
(i.e., when n is parallel to the coordinate axis x) can be rationalized via a survey of the analytic
expressions Eqs.(11) and (12). Noting that, in this case, only derivatives of φ with respect to
the x-coordinate occur along the x-direction, we set all the terms containing derivative with
respect to y to zero and arrive at

The cancellation effect thus changes the order of the error in κ and explains the excellent
agreement between numerical solution and the exact result for the case of θ = 0. This is depicted
in Fig. 4, where by using Eq. (2) for curvature the error shows fourth order dependencies on
grid spacing ∆x for coarser grids. For higher resolution, however, the error becomes again
second order. As seen in Fig. 4, the same trend is observed for a 4-th order discretization of
the Laplacian in Eq. (6). Interestingly, the magnitude of error is still roughly by two decades
smaller in the case of a 2-nd oder scheme for Eq. (2).
The results discussed above have been obtained for a relatively high interface resolution
of W = 40∆x. This choice was useful in order to highlight the central aspect of this work,
the cancellation of errors. However, such a high interface resolution is impractical due to the

closely related computational expenses. In fact, the interface width needs to be resolved as
coarse as possible to decrease the computational cost, while keeping the error in a tolerable
range. Guided by this idea, we have evaluated the local curvature across the interface for a
relatively coarse grid of W = 10∆x for the entire interface domain. Results shown in Fig. 5
provide numerical evidence that the cancellation of errors is still intact at this coarse grid. Note
that, since tanh profile reaches the bulk limits only at infinity, a practical cut-off is introduced.
Similar to our previous study [11], we define W/2 as the distance from the interface center, for
which the tanh profile reaches the bulk-value within 0.1%.
We shall close this report by addressing an important point. The above discussed sensitivity
of the local curvature to the use of a non-local (differential) scheme in evaluating the second
term (Eq. (2)) as opposed to the use of a local expression (Eq. 6)) is important only if the local
value of curvature is used to update the kinetics of phase boundary. The situation becomes,
however, quite unproblematic if only the value of the curvature averaged along the interface
normal is used. This is illustrated in Fig. 6, where the interface average curvature,
 η

is shown versus the angle θ between the interface normal vector and the x-axis for the both
approaches, Eqs. (2) and (6), and the two investigated interface profiles. Indeed, the relative
error in its interface averaged value κIA remains below 0.1% for both the approaches and
regardless of the orientation of the interface normal with respect to the underlying grid.

Summary and outlook

In this work, we report on a detailed analysis of the numerical evaluation of curvature of
the boundary between two adjacent phases in diffuse interface approaches such as the phase
field method. It is shown that two essentially equivalent expressions exist with quite distinct
behavior in their numerical error. Using the standard definition of curvature as the divergence
of the unit normal vector to the interface, a first expression is worked out (Eq. (2)). A second

expression is obtained by comparing the dynamic equation for the phase field variable and the
Gibbs-Thompson equation (Eq. (6)). It is shown that the first approach does in general yield
a more accurate result for the local curvature than the second one. The origin of this behavior
is shown via both analytic and numerical error estimates to lie in the cancellation of errors.
The quality of this error cancellation does, however, depend on the orientation of the interface
normal vector with respect to the underlying grid. It would be interesting to perform a more
in depth analysis of this property in a future study. Moreover, For the sake of simplicity, the
present work was restricted to the case of phase boundary between two individual phases only.
The arguments put forward in this work, can be, nevertheless, easily generalized to the case of
multi-phase field method, where more than two domains are at contact as it occurs in multiple
junctions. Similar error cancellation effects are expected to be relevant also in this more general
case. A thorough study of this issue would also be very interesting. The present study reveals
the asymmetric behavior of the error term along the direction normal to the interface, thereby
shedding light onto the empirical observation that approaches using the average of the curvature
along the interface normal do usually yield accurate results even for relatively poor resolution
of 4-5 grid spacing for the entire interface width (see, e.g. wwww.openphase.de).

Error Analysis

In this paper, we used the so called 9-point Laplacian [12] which is given by

+ φ(x − ∆x, y − ∆x) − 4φ(x, y) ,

(15)
where ∆x = ∆y. The exact Laplacian and the corresponding error term can be derived by a
Taylor expansion of individual terms in Eq. (15) and neglecting the higher order terms. As
example, the Taylor expansion of two of the above terms is written below

Similarly, by writing the Taylor expansion for all the other terms, the expression for exact
Laplacian can be obtained,
φ(x + ∆x, y) = φ(x, y) + ∆xφx +

The error of Laplacian is given by the difference of the exact and the numerical values. This
reads,
∆x2
Err1 =
(φxxxx + 2φxxyy + φyyyy ) + O(∆x3 ).
(18)

On the other hand, the second term of Eq. (2), is expanded as
φ2x φxx + φ2y φyy + 2φx φy φxy
∇φ · ∇|∇φ|
=
.
|∇φ|
φ2x + φ2y

(19)

This can be numerically evaluated using the second order central finite difference scheme for
each term, which is very simple and we avoid writing them. In Analogy to the derivation of

where f (x, y) = φ2x φxx + φ2y φyy + 2φx φy φxy and g(x, y) = φ2x + φ2y . E(f ) and E(g) are the error
terms corresponding to f (x, y) and g(x, y), respectively. They are given by
E(f ) =

By using Taylor series up to the first order, one obtains from Eq. (21)

(23)

Since E(f ) and E(g) are both of the second order in ∆x we can neglect the last term. Finally,
we use the fact that f (x, y)/g(x, y) is actually the exact value of the expression on the left hand
side of the equation, i.e., it is the second term in Eq. (2). This yields
Err2 =
