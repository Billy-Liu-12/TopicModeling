Abstract
A procedure for low-cost multi-objective design optimization of antenna structures is discussed. The
major stages of the optimization process include: (i) an initial reduction of the search space aimed at
identifying its relevant subset containing the Pareto-optimal design space, (ii) construction‚Äîusing
sampled coarse-discretization electromagnetic (EM) simulation data‚Äîof the response surface
approximation surrogate, (iii) surrogate optimization using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm,
and (iv) the Pareto front refinement. Our optimization procedure is demonstrated through the design of
a planar quasi Yagi-Uda antenna. The final set of designs representing the best available trade-offs
between conflicting objectives is obtained at a computational cost corresponding to about 172
evaluations of the high-fidelity EM antenna model.

1 Introduction
Design of antenna structures is a challenging task that requires taking into account a number of
objectives, concerning electrical performance parameters (such as reflection response, gain, radiation
pattern) as well as the antenna geometry, in particular, minimization of the antenna size or footprint in
case of planar structures. In practice, typically only one of the objectives is optimized directly,
whereas others are handled through suitably defined constraints or penalty functions. In many

situations, however, it is advantageous to identify certain set of alternative designs representing the
best possible trade-offs between various figures of interest (also referred to as a Pareto front). In this
case, multi-objective optimization is necessary. The most popular solution approaches for this type of
problem include population-based metaheuristics, such as genetic algorithms (Kuwahara, 2005; Yang,
et al. 2008), particle swarm optimizers (Afshinmanesh, et al. 2008; Chamaani, et al. 2011), or
differential evolution (Goudos and Sahalos, 2010; Rocca, et al. 2011). While metaheuristics allow for
generating the entire Pareto set in a single algorithm run, their drawback is a high computational cost,
typically measured in thousands of objective evaluations (Bekasiewicz et al. 2014a; Koziel et al.
2014a; Koziel et al. 2014b). This is a fundamental limitation when high-fidelity full-wave
electromagnetic (EM) analysis is utilized for antenna evaluation.
The difficulties related to the high computational cost of the optimization process can be alleviated
by using surrogate models (Koziel and Yang, 2011; El Zooghby et al. 2000). Surrogate-based
optimization (SBO) replaces direct handling of expensive EM antenna models by iterative
construction and optimization of fast replacement models ‚Äì the so-called surrogates (Bandler et al.
2004; Koziel and Bandler, 2008; Queipo et al. 2005). In (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013), an efficient
SBO procedure for multi-objective antenna design was introduced, utilizing a multi-objective
evolutionary algorithm (MOGA) and auxiliary response surface approximation (RSA) model. The
method was further improved in (Koziel, et al. 2014a) by endowing it with a procedure for design
space (DS) reduction that allows for constructing the RSA model with a reasonable number of samples
even in higher-dimensional spaces. Design cases with more than a dozen of adjustable parameters
have been successfully solved using this approach (Bekasiewicz et al. 2014a; Koziel et al. 2014a).
Nevertheless, even with the reduced design space, the overhead related to data acquisition for
constructing of the RSA model may still be considerable and can become a dominant contributor to
the overall optimization cost.
In this paper, an enhanced design space reduction algorithm is proposed. Our approach extends the
reduction scheme (Bekasiewicz et al. 2014a)‚Äîbased on the extreme points of the Pareto set obtained
through single-objective optimization runs‚Äîby means of coordinate system rotation aimed at more
precise location of the Pareto front. It allows for further reduction of the cost related to construction of
the RSA model, utilized by the algorithm (Koziel et al. 2014a). The technique is demonstrated using a
planar Yagi-Uda antenna example with 24 designable parameters, and a Pareto set representation
found at the cost corresponding to only 172 evaluations of the high-fidelity EM antenna model.

2 Formulation of the Multi-Objective Antenna Design Problem
Accurate evaluation of antenna performance requires full-wave electromagnetic (EM) analysis.
Here, a high-fidelity EM model of the antenna structure under design will be denoted as Rf(x), where x
stands for a vector of adjustable geometry parameters. The model response represents antenna
characteristics such as reflection versus frequency, antenna gain, or radiation pattern.
Let Fk(x), k = 1, ‚Ä¶, Nobj, be a kth design objective. A typical performance objective would be to
minimize the antenna reflection over a certain frequency band of interest, and to ensure that |S11| < ‚Äì
10dB over that band. There might be also some geometrical objectives such as to minimize Fk(x) =
A(x) ‚Äì the antenna size defined in a convenient way (e.g., maximal lateral size, height, the maximal
dimension, area of the footprint, antenna volume). Similar objectives can be formulated with respect to
the antenna gain, radiation pattern, efficiency, etc.
If Nobj > 1, then any two designs x(1) and x(2) for which Fk(x(1)) < Fk(x(2)) and Fl(x(2)) < Fl(x(1)) for at
least one pair k z l, are not commensurable, i.e., none is better than the other in the multi-objective
sense. For the sake of multi-objective optimization, we utilize a Pareto dominance relation % (Deb,
2001) defined as follows: for the two designs x and y, we have x % y (x dominates over y) if Fk(x) <
Fk(y) for all k = 1, ‚Ä¶, Nobj. The goal of the multi-objective optimization if to find a representation of a

so-called Pareto front (or a Pareto-optimal set) XP of the design space X, such that for any x ¬è XP,
there is no y ¬è X for which y % x (Deb, 2001).

3 Surrogate-Based Multi-Objective Optimization
Due to a high computational cost of EM simulations, a direct multi-objective optimization of the
high-fidelity antenna model Rf is not practical. Instead, we use a surrogate-based approach of (Koziel
and Ogurtsov, 2013) which exploits two types of lower-fidelity models. The first one is a coarse-mesh
EM model Rcd, which is evaluated using the same electromagnetic solver as the one used for Rf,
however, with a coarser discretization of the structure. As a result, the simulation time can be lowered
considerably (typically, Rcd is 10 to 50 times faster than Rf), of course, at the expense of limited
accuracy. Unfortunately, Rcd is still too expensive for direct multi-objective optimization. Therefore,
we utilize another auxiliary model, which is a fast response surface approximation (RSA) surrogate Rs
obtained from sampled Rcd data. Here, we use kriging interpolation (Queipo et al. 2005; Siah et al.
2004). Latin Hypercube Sampling (Giunta et al. 2003) serves as the design of experiments technique.
The sampling process and RSA model construction are carried out in the reduced design space (see
Section 4 for a detailed description of the design space reduction algorithm).
An initial approximation of the Pareto set is subsequently obtained by optimizing the RSA
surrogate using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) (Koziel and Ogurtsov, 2013). We
utilize a rather standard implementation of MOEA with Pareto-ranking-based tournament selection,
fitness sharing and mating restrictions (Deb, 2001). The Pareto set obtained at this stage corresponds
to the low-fidelity model Rcd so that its further refinement is necessary in order to obtain a
representation at the high-fidelity model level. Thus, the final optimization stage consists of the
refinement of K designs xs(k), k = 1, ‚Ä¶, K, selected from the Pareto front found by the MOEA. To
simplify the description, we make the assumption of having two objectives; generalization for larger
number of objectives is straightforward. The refinement process is realized as follows (Bandler et al.
2004):
x (fk .i 1)

arg

min

x , F2 ( x )d F2 ( xs( k .i ) )

F1  Rs ( x )  [ R f ( xs( k .i ) )  Rs ( xs( k .i ) )]

(1)

i.e., the refined design is obtained by optimizing the corrected RSA surrogate. Here, we use output
space mapping (Bandler et al. 2004) as the correction method. More specifically, we aim at improving
the first objective without degrading the second one. In practice, 2 or 3 iterations of (1) are sufficient
to find a refined high-fidelity model design xf(k) (Bekasiewicz et al. 2014a; Koziel et al. 2014a). The
final outcome of the multi-objective optimization process is a set of refined Pareto-optimal highfidelity model designs xf(k), k = 1,‚Ä¶,K.
The design optimization procedure can be summarized as follows:
1. Perform design space reduction (cf. Section 4);
2. Sample the design space and acquire the Rcd data;
3. Construct the RSA surrogate model Rs;
4. Obtain the Pareto front by optimizing Rs using the MOEA;
5. Refine selected elements of the Pareto front, xs(k), to obtain the corresponding high-fidelity
model designs xf(k).
Steps 1, 2, and 5 of the above procedure are the most significant contributors to the overall
optimization cost. Step 1 is normally realized by means of an SBO algorithm (with coarsediscretization EM simulations used as the underlying low-fidelity model) so that its cost may be kept
reasonably low (about a dozen or so high-fidelity antenna simulations per extreme Pareto set point).

and Rotational Design Space Reduction

Constructing the RSA model requires a few hundred to over one thousand Rcd samples. It should be
emphasized, however, that this would not be possible‚Äîwithin a reasonable timeframe‚Äîwithout the
space reduction step, if the number of design variables exceeds a few (in practice, 5 or 6). The cost of
the refinement stage depends on the number of designs to be obtained as the algorithm outcome
(typically around 10). The combination of the design space reduction and the surrogate model allows
for lowering the overall optimization cost from thousands or tens of thousands of EM simulations
required in direct MOEA-based optimization to dozens (or at most a few hundred for very complex
cases).

4 Reduction of the Design Space
Constructing a reliable approximation model is one of the most important steps of the multiobjective optimization flow of Section 3. Although the RSA model is obtained from coarsediscretization EM simulation data (computationally much cheaper than the high-fidelity ones), the data
acquisition is still a considerable challenge in computational terms. In practical problems, the number
of the degrees of freedom in antenna structures tends to be large (cases with 10 to 20 parameters are
not uncommon). Moreover, the ranges of parameters are wide because initial guesses about optimal
dimensions are very difficult. Additionally, the solutions of interest from the multi-objectiveoptimization point of view normally occupy a small region of the design space. This is visualized in
Fig. 1 using an example of a three-parameter UWB monocone antenna. Consequently, the required
number of training samples may be impractically large even for relatively low-dimensional design
spaces. Moreover, a vast majority of these samples are not relevant for antenna optimization since they
are allocated outside the subset of the space containing Pareto-optimal solutions. To alleviate this
difficulty, we utilize a three-step scheme for the design space reduction. The first step is a technique
introduced in (Koziel et al. 2014a) that allocates the extreme points of the Pareto set (cf. Section 4.1).
The second and the third step are based on an appropriate rotation of the coordinate system and are
described in Section 4.2.

4.1 Initial Space Reduction through Extreme Pareto Set Points
The initial design space reduction relies on identifying the extreme points of the Pareto front. Let
x*(k) = argmin{x : Fk(Rcd(x))}, k = 1, ‚Ä¶, Nobj, be the optimum design with respect to the kth objective.
The vectors x*(k) determine the extreme points of the Pareto set. The reduced design space is then
defined through the following lower and upper bounds, l and u, respectively: l = min{x*(1), x*(2), ‚Ä¶,
x*(Nobj)}, and u = max{x*(1), x*(2), ‚Ä¶, x*(Nobj)} (cf. Fig. 2(a) for conceptual explanation). In practice, the
reduced space is a very small fraction of the initial one, which makes the creation of the RSA model
computationally feasible. While there is no guarantee that the design space reduced as above will
contain the entire Pareto front, it will typically contain the majority of it (including, of course, the
extreme points).

4.2 Design Space Reduction through Coordinate System Rotation
The second stage of the design space reduction procedure aims at more precise identification of the
region containing the Pareto set, which includes determining its orientation within the design space.
This stage allows for a further reduction of the number of samples required for creating the RSA
model, which might be essential for highly-dimensional search spaces. The main assumption here is
that majority of the Pareto-optimal solutions are‚Äîin practical cases‚Äîallocated close to the diagonal
of the reduced space connecting the extreme points x*(1) and x*(2) (the current version of the method
only works for Nobj = 2), cf. Fig. 2(b).

An outline of the entire reduction procedure is as follows:
Step 1: Execute the reduction procedure (Koziel et al. 2014a) to obtain the initially reduced space (the
‚Äúbox‚Äù);
Step 2: Perform a rotation of the box (cf. Fig. 2(b));
Step 3: Perform a reduction of the box size (cf. Fig. 2(c));
Step 2 is realized by an appropriate rotation of the coordinate system. Let x0 = (x*(1) + x*(2))/2 be
the center of the box. Let v be a unit vector v = (x*(1)  x*(2))/||x*(1)  x*(2)||, and e1 be a unit vector of the
standard basis associated with the largest box dimension. The box is rotated around x0 with respect to
a two-dimensional subspace spanned by vectors v and e1, so that the points x*(1) and x*(2) become the
centers of its two faces as shown in Fig. 2(b). A rigorous description of the rotation process is omitted
here for the sake of brevity. The dimensions of the rotated box are the same as the corresponding
(through the rotated standard basis vectors) dimensions of the original box, except the one
corresponding to the main diagonal (now equal to ||x*(1)  x*(2)||).
In the last step of the process (Step 3), the rotated box is linearly reduced in all dimensions except
the ‚Äúdiagonal‚Äù one. The appropriate reduction rate can be found iteratively (by identifying the Pareto
sets for increasing reduction rates, and looking for front ‚Äúsaturation‚Äù). Here, we reduce a rotated box
by a factor of 3, which is a rule of thumb found by considering multiple practical cases. Note, that this
reduction rate results in approximately (assuming a relatively small rotation angle T) 3n‚Äì1 reduction of
the design space volume compared to that obtained through (Koziel et al. 2014a). For n = 10
dimensions, this additional reduction is over 104 (volume-wise).

5 Design Case: Yagi-Uda Antenna
Consider a planar quasi Yagi-Uda antenna (Wu et al. 2014) as shown in Fig. 3. The structure is
designated to operate on a Taconic RF-35 dielectric substrate (Œµr = 3.5, tanŒ¥ = 0.0018 and h = 0.762). The
antenna is composed of a driven element in the form of a dipole excited through a coplanar stripline
(CPS) and two directors. The structure is fed by a microstrip-to-CPS transition which provides
wideband operation for 50-Ohm input impedance through a microstrip matching transformer. The
antenna is miniaturized using two symmetrical ground plane stubs that increase the current path within
a ground plane.

The high-fidelity model (~2,100,000 mesh cells and average simulation time of 13 min) and the
low-fidelity model (~80,000 mesh cells, average simulation time of 40 s) of the antenna are
implemented in CST Microwave Studio (CST, 2013) and evaluated using its time domain solver. The
design objectives are: F1 ‚Äì minimization of reflection, and F2 ‚Äì maximization of mean gain. Both are
considered within 4 GHz to 10 GHz frequency range of interest. Additionally, the in-band reflection
responses of the Pareto optimal design solutions are supposed to be kept below an acceptable level of
‚Äì10 dB.

5.1 Results
The antenna structure is initially described by a vector of 24 independent design parameters
x(0) = [w0 d1 d2 g1 l1 l2 l3 l4 l6 l7 l8 lf o1 o2 s1 s2 s3 w1 w2 w3 w4 w5 w7 w8]T (see Fig. 3(b) for visualization).
Additionally, we assume l5 = 3l3, whereas d3 = 3, d4 = 6.5, wf = 1.7, w6 = 1 remain fixed to reduce the
design space dimensionality and provide 50-Ohm input impedance (all dimensions in mm). The initial
design is as x(0) = [30 0.65 3 2.9 1.7 2.15 0.6 0.6 3 9 7 9 0 0 2 2 2 0.7 1.7 2.5 3.4 1.6 1.4 1.6]T. The initial
design space is defined by the following l/u bounds (chose arbitrarily): l = [20 0 1 1 0.1 1 0.2 0.2 1 5 5 5
0 0 1 1 1 0.2 1.2 2 2.9 0.5 0.5 0.5]T and u = [40 1 5 5 4 4 1.2 1.2 5 13 13 13 2 2 4 4 4 1.2 2.2 3 3.9 2.5 2.5
2.5]T. Such a configuration of parameters is utilized for the reduction of a design space (DS) by means of
sequential optimizations with respect to one design objective at a time (cf. Section 4).
Subsequently, a number of the optimized parameters of an antenna, namely: lf = 7.5, w1 = 0.7, w0 =
28.86, l4 = 0.58, o2 = 0.13, d2 = 3, l7 = 9.47, and l8 = 6.21 have been fixed since they remain unchanged
for the extreme designs. As a result, the solution space dimensionality has been confined to 16
independent design variables: x = [d1 g1 l1 l2 l3 l6 o1 s1 s2 s3 w2 w3 w4 w5 w7 w8]T and the refined
lower/upper bounds are as follows: l* = [0.65 1.63 1.9 2.02 0.72 2.6 0.09 2 2 2 1.7 2.3 2.9 1.6 1.68
2.24 ]T and u* = [0.68 3.09 2 2.07 0.96 2.83 1.09 2.2 2.13 3.73 2.04 2.92 3.4 2.08 2.43 2.45] T. One
should emphasize that after a first step of DS reduction, the refined space is 18 orders of magnitude
smaller (volume-wise) in comparison to the initial one.
Next, Steps 2 and 3 of the procedure of Section 4.2 have been applied to rotate the cuboid defined
by the l*/u* bounds; the size of the rotated box is the reduced by a factor of 3 with respect to all
dimensions except the one corresponding to the main diagonal of the original box. The final DS is
defined by a set of 16 independent design variables. Moreover, it is 7 orders smaller (volume-wise) in
comparison to the one obtained after first step of the introduced reduction procedure and about 10 25
smaller than the one defined initially for 24 design variables.
After the DS reduction procedure, a kriging interpolation model Rs is constructed within the
reduced space using 502 samples of the Rcd model (here, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) is utilized

890

as the design of experiments procedure). The average relative RMS error of the model Rs is 2%.
Subsequently, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is executed to find a Pareto set. The algorithm
is run for 50 iterations with the population of the size of 500 individuals. A set of 10 design solutions
selected across the Pareto set are then used for design refinement using the output space mapping
algorithm (Bandler et al. 2004). A comparison of the Rf and Rs model representations of the Pareto
front is shown in Fig. 4.
The design featuring the highest average gain of 6.8 dB simultaneously offers the worst acceptable
in-band reflection (the gain values vary by 6% over the entire Pareto set), whereas the design with the
best reflection of ‚Äì16.7 dB exhibits the smallest gain (reflection variability is 34%). The obtained
results clearly indicate conflicting nature of design objectives. The details for selected Pareto-optimal
designs are gathered in Table 1, whereas their frequency and gain characteristics are shown in Fig. 5.
For the sake of comparison a kriging interpolation model Rs* has been constructed within initially
reduced solution space using a set of 2002 LHS-based samples of the Rcd model. Despite of using four
times more training samples, the average relative RMS error for the Rs* model is 3% (50% higher than
for Rs). The model Rs* has also been optimized using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with 50
iterations and a population size of 500 individuals. A comparison of the obtained Pareto-optimal sets
is given in Fig. 6. It should be emphasized that the Pareto set obtained within the rotated solution
space is characterized by greater diversity of solutions than the set obtained with the model Rs*. The
results also indicate correctness of the proposed rule of thumb, which considerably decreased the
number of samples required for a construction of a reliable antenna model.
The total aggregated cost of quasi Yagi-Uda antenna optimization corresponds to about 172 Rf
simulations (~38 hours of the CPU time) and includes: 2,917 Rcd model simulations for the initial
design space reduction (1,076 Rcd and 1,841 Rcd simulations for optimization required for
minimization of S11 and maximization of gain, respectively), 502 Rcd evaluations for a construction of
the Rs model, and 30 Rf simulations for a refinement of 10 points selected across the Pareto-optimal
set. One should emphasize that the proposed methodology allows for obtaining comprehensive
information about the antenna without involving considerable computational resources. The estimated
cost of direct optimization of such a structure using only high-fidelity model simulations is 25,000 Rf
model evaluations (over 260 days of the CPU time), whereas the cost of antenna optimization using
only Rcd representation would correspond to about 1,111 Rf evaluations (~278 hours). Therefore, the
proposed design and optimization methodology outperforms direct optimization schemes driven by
multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (being 145 and 6.5 times faster comparing to the former and
the latter, respectively).

6 Conclusion
A methodology for computationally efficient multi-objective design optimization of antenna structures
has been presented. The key to handling optimization problems in highly-dimensional design spaces is an
appropriate design space reduction by identifying the search space region containing the set of Pareto
optimal solutions. In this work, it is realized as a two-step process: (i) an initial reduction by means of
finding the extreme points of the Pareto set (obtained through single-objective optimization w.r.t. one
objective at a time), and (ii) a coordinate system rotation and further reduction of the rotated box
(hypercube) that confines the Pareto set. This, together with exploitation of auxiliary models (coarsediscretization EM simulations and fast response surface approximation one) allows for finding the Pareto
set at a cost corresponding to a few dozen of high-fidelity antenna simulations, even for relative large
number of designable parameters, as demonstrated using a planar quasi Yagi-Uda antenna example.
Future work will be directed towards reduction of the computational cost required to determine the
extreme Pareto-optimal designs, which exceeds the cost of the kriging model construction for multidimensional designs. Moreover, extending the proposed rotational design space reduction technique for
optimization problems with more than two design objectives will be conducted.
