Abstract
We extend the hierarchical transformation multigrid (HT-MG) method with semi-coarsening in space and time
in order to tackle anisotropic problems. Semi-coarsening allows us to smooth on anisotropic grids and, thus to employ more advanced multigrid cycles, e.g. the so-called Q-cycle. Our numerical examples show that we can tackle
anisotropic problems with the HT-MG method and the Q-cycle. We do not only apply the multigrid method in space
directions but also in time directions where the Q-cycle is beneﬁcial again.
Keywords: anisotropic problems, multigrid, semi-coarsening, time-space discretization

1. Introduction
Multigrid methods [1, 2] have been shown to be among the fastest solution techniques for a wide class of partial
diﬀerential equations. We consider the hierarchical transformation multigrid (HT-MG) method introduced in [3].
It uses a hierarchical representation of the solution function, i.e., the change of values at coarse grid points entails
an appropriate change of the values at ﬁne grid points. We represent each operator as a tensor product of onedimensional operators which allows us to treat each coordinate direction separately. Thus, semi-coarsening becomes
possible which means we can coarse and reﬁne in each direction independently. This allows us to include anisotropic
grids in our grid hierarchy. We also consider a space-time discretization of the heat equation, cf. [4] for a space-time
HT-MG multigrid method with an emphasis on massively parallel machines and the usual multigrid cycles without
semi-coarsening. Here we combine the HT-MG method with advanced multigrid cycles employing semi-coarsening
and a space-time discretization which leads to a highly eﬃcient method as we will show by numerical examples in
Sec. 4.

with the operator L : U → F and two appropriate function spaces U and F, see [1]. We assume that the operator
L already incorporates the Dirichlet boundary conditions. We denote the discrete analog of Lu = f with Lk uk = fk
where Lk : Uk → Fk is a linear operator and Uk , Fk are appropriate spaces of grid functions on the grid Ωk with mesh
width hk = 1/3k . Note that we use grids with hk = 1/3k instead of the more common grids with hk = 1/2k , cf. [5].

We derive the hierarchical surplus uk of the ﬁne grid approximation uk as uk = uk − Pkk−1 Rˆ k−1
k uk . The transformation
k ˆ k−1
from uk to Pk−1 Rk uk + uk is called the hierarchical transformation [3]. Fig. 1 shows the hierarchical transformation
of an one-dimensional example. It illustrates, if coarse grid points are modiﬁed, the values at ﬁne grid points change
as well.
In the context of multigrid methods, we do not only need one discrete operator L on the ﬁnest grid Ω but discrete

The order of recursive calls of the HT-MG algorithm depends on the employed multigrid cycle. A simple cycle
s-Cycle(d, ν, S ) performs one multigrid iteration with coarsening in direction d where ν relaxation sweeps S are
used for pre- and postsmoothing. Note that we allow mesh size 1 in time in order to cope with the stationary heat
equation (Poisson’s equation). A V-cycle in space and time corresponds to the call “s-Cycle(t, 1, s-Cycle((x, y), ν,
S ))” which means that an ordinary V-cycle in space is used at every time step 0, . . . , t . Whereas the V-cycle coarsens
in x and y direction simultaneously, the Q-cycle coarsens every direction separately, i.e. a Q-cycle corresponds to
“s-Cycle(t, 1, s-Cycle(x, 1, s-Cycle(y, ν, S )))”. This leads to grids with diﬀerent mesh sizes in diﬀerent directions, i.e.
semi-coarsening. Fig. 1 visualizes how the V- and the Q-cycle traverse the grid hierarchy in the two space directions.
3. Discretization of the Heat Equation in Space and Time
Let us now come to a suitable discretization of the heat equation ∂t u − Δu = f for the HT-MG method. The
discretization has to be carried out in both space and time. We look upon time just as any other coordinate direction.
Let Ω ⊆ R2 be a domain and (0, tend ) ⊆ R the time interval of length tend . The heat equation is
a · ∂t u(x, y, t) − b x · ∂2x u(x, y, t) + ∂2y u(x, y, t) =
u(x, y, t) =
u(x, y, 0)

(x, y, t) ∈ Ω × (0, tend ),

(x, y) ∈ Ω,

where u : Ω × [0, tend ] → R2 , u0 : Ω → R2 and an appropriate right hand side f ∈ L2 (Ω × (0, tend )). Note that we
1. In contrast to the discretization given
obtain Poisson’s equation with a = 0 and an anisotropic problem with b x
in [3], our discretization considers every operator separately and not the whole equation at once. Each operator is split
into a tensor product of one-dimensional operators
∂t u(x, y, t) − ∂2x u(x, y, t) + ∂2y u(x, y, t) = I x × Iy × Dt u(x, y, t) − D2x × Iy × It + I x × D2y × It u(x, y, t),

Figure 1: Hierarchical transformation (a) of uk with the coarse grid points x0 and x3 and the ﬁne grid points x1 and x2 . Note that the hierarchical
surplus at a coarse grid point is always 0 because we employ linear prolongation and trivial restriction. The HT-MG method can employ either the
V-cycle (b) which reﬁnes in both space directions simultaneously or the Q-cycle (c) which reﬁnes each direction separately.

where D denotes the derivation and I the identity operator. We now need a discretization of the one-dimensional
operators D and I, and in order to allow to coarse and reﬁne in each direction separately, we also need their coarse
counter parts. Such one-dimensional operators are constructed in [6] and lead to the well-known stencil 1/6 · [1 4 1]
for I and 1/h2 · [1 − 2 1] for D. With the help of an eigenvalue analysis, it can be shown, that the stencils only change
by a factor of 3 during a coarsening or reﬁnement step, see [6] for details. This means, we can keep the stencils during
the whole multigrid cycle and only have to take care that the result is multiplied with the correct power of 3.
4. Numerical Results
We consider the heat equation and Poisson’s equation with the discretization of Sec. 3. We always use the lexicographical Gauss-Seidel relaxation [1] to smooth the error, as well as the trivial injection as restriction, and linear
interpolation as prolongation in space directions and constant interpolation in time direction. Note that we can have
a diﬀerent prolongation in time than in space directions [6]. If not otherwise speciﬁed, we have the right hand side
f = 1.
First, we consider stationary (a = 0) anisotropic problems (b x
1). Fig. 2 (left) shows the convergence of
the HT-MG method with the V-cycle with b x ∈ {1, 10, 50, 100} and ν = 2 pre- and postsmoothing steps on the grid
243 × 243 × 1 with mesh size h = 1/243. The V-cycle works well for the isotropic problem (b x = 1) but already
for the anisotropic problem with only b x = 10, we observe a very slow convergence. This becomes even worse with
b x = 50 and b x = 100. It is well known that we can recover multigrid performance with semi-coarsening [1]. Thus,
we employ the Q-cycle with semi-coarsening, see Fig. 2 (right) and we obtain a rapid convergence of the HT-MG
method not only with b x = 1 but also with b x ∈ {10, 50, 100}.
We also want to compare the V- and the Q-cycle with respect to the number of relaxations needed to obtain a
certain accuracy. It can be easily shown that during one Q-cycle three to four times as many equations are relaxed
as during one V-cycle. The convergence behavior of the HT-MG method with the V-cycle and b x = 50 is shown in
Fig. 2 (left). About 10 V-cycles are needed to reduce the residual by a factor of 102 . However, we can achieve the
same reduction with only one Q-cycle. Thus, the Q-cycle is also distinctly more eﬃcient with respect to the number
of relaxations.
A similar behavior can be observed for the heat equation (a = 1, f = 1) if we employ the HT-MG method in space
and time on the grid 243 × 243 × 9. We consider b x ∈ {1, 10, 50, 100} but now with a = 1. We employ the V- and
Q-cycle not only in space directions but in space and time directions. Fig. 3 compares the performance of the V- and
the Q-cycle in space and time. Whereas the V-cycle has distinct problems, the Q-cycle can also cope with anisotropic
problems with b x
1 again.
5. Conclusion
We added semi-coarsening (Q-cycle) to the hierarchical transformation multigrid (HT-MG) method introduced
in [3]. With semi-coarsening it is possible to employ more advanced multigrid cycles, e.g. the Q-cycle, which do

not only use a grid hierarchy with isotropic but also with anisotropic grids. Such a grid hierarchy is needed for e.g.
anisotropic problems which play an important role in practice [1]. In order to allow semi-coarsening, it was necessary
to split the operators of the governing equation into tensor products of one-dimensional operators. The numerical
results have shown that anisotropic problems can be eﬃciently treated with the Q-cycle. This is not only true for
multigrid in space directions, but also for multigrid in space and time.
