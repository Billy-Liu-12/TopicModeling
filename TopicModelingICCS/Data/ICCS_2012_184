Abstract
This paper illustrates a method that identiﬁes abnormal neurological events associated with acute brain injuries
and seizures. The data is derived from intracortical electrodes that transmit EEG recordings that contain substantial
amounts of noise. The output for the identiﬁcation is speciﬁcally designed to be fed back into nan artiﬁcial intelligence
unit the authors have designed that predict seizures in rats within 6 seconds of onset. This data will verify whether
or not the prediction as accurate or not. The methodology set forth in this paper reﬂects the results of an ongoing
research program that has investigated multiple techniques that have computational simplicity and are able to identify
events with high precision. The paper presents our most recent in-house algorithm for seizure detection. The authors
present this novel approach through the analysis of 3 channel EEG recordings from 3 rats that have 10 seizures each.
The algorithm uses a Riemann sum analysis that compares the time to zero crossings with the absolute amplitude of
the intervening signal. Herein, the authors present a system that incorporates clustering analysis using fuzzy K-means
(FCM) and K-medoid clustering that identiﬁes and separates artifact and normal states of animal with states seizure.
Keywords: Epileptogenesis, Fuzzy K-means, K-medoid Clustering

1. Introduction
The author’s hypothesis is that in a domain of time versus amplitudinal strength in encephalograms of a rat during
seizure, artifact remain stationary in continuous clustered segments while seizure activity should move. The basis for
this is because the authors believed that artifact will be randomly distributed, speciﬁcally, the amplitude is lower with
normal neural activity because its not coherent. Whereas the inverse should be true during seizure. The authors
decided that the optimal means of challenging our hypothesis would be to represent the neurological activity in
clusters with the x-axis representing change over time plotted against y-axis representing the amplitudinal strength.
Choosing a means of clustering analytics lead us to applying the fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm and the k-medoid
algorithm because they are often used in visualization for image segmentation, in our case the authors are performing
encephalogram separation. Furthermore one knows that when noisy domain segmentation is required one typically
modiﬁes the FCM accordingly. Here, the authors performed minimal modiﬁcation of the original algorithm once

we clustered the signal on our in-house system. The resultant clustering and the movement of the clustering during
epileptoid periods was remarkably distinct. This paper presents our methodology and the resultants. This paper is
not a deﬁnitive resultant. However, we do believe that the dissemination of how we’ve identiﬁed a means to measure
speciﬁc vector-based movement by tracking epileptogenesis with layered fuzzy K-means and k-medoid clustering.
2. Background
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder wherein clusters of neurons ﬁre electrical signals abnormally that cause recurrent unprovoked seizures. Unfortunately, 30% of patients that suﬀer from epilepsy are not well controlled on
medication. Only a small fraction of these can be helped by seizure surgery [1]. Therefore, it would be life changing
to a large number of individuals if a system could be developed that would predict a seizure hours, minutes, or even
seconds before its clinical onset. The challenge in this problem is that the dimensionality is huge; in the human brain
there are approximately 100 billion neurons, each with about 1000 connections (synapses)[2]. Even in the rat brain it
is estimated that there are approximately 200 million neurons [3], [4]. The connections are wired such that the problem is highly chaotic. In a certain class of seizures it would be helpful if they could be detected even a few seconds
prior to the start of a seizure. The dimensionality of the problem can be signiﬁcantly reduced, with only a small loss of
information by recording electrical potentials at multiple points on the surface of the skull or, using depth electrodes,
in the hippocampus (EEG). EEGs are accepted as one of the best means of evaluating neurocognitive functions [5].
EEG spike/seizure detection and prediction is made more complicated by the following: (1) For a single individual, no
two seizures or even their EEG correlates are exactly alike, (2) seizures from diﬀerent individuals vary signiﬁcantly,
(3) there is no single metric that consistently changes during all seizures, (4) correlation among channels can change
signiﬁcantly from one seizure to the next, and (5) even experts disagree as to what constitutes a seizure [6]. For the
reasons listed above, rigid seizure detection rules do not produce good results [7], [8]. This is the focus of this paper:
Improved epileptogenesis can be achieved when a narrower empirically identiﬁable means of determining when a
seizure is occurring.
2.1. Recording Epileptogenesis
Until 1992 most EEG analysis was based on analysis of brain slices [9] or anesthetized animals [10]. Kainic
acid, a chemoconvulsant extracted from seaweed, was introduced to induce seizures in animals. This provided a
major breakthrough particularly with the advent of monitoring the animals on video, but the equally signiﬁcant subclinical seizures were impossible to detect with video monitoring alone. The ﬁeld was further advanced through the
development of a tethered recording system [11] in which multi-channel cortical and sub-cortical recordings could be
obtained. The quality of recordings were further improved by incorporating a small pre-ampliﬁer close to the skull,
allowing for a signiﬁcant increase in the signal to noise (S/N) ratio. Electrodes were placed stereotaxically in the
hippocampus and secured in the skull [12], [13] Additional electrodes were placed directly on the dura. Dental cement was applied to hold the electrode pins together in a plastic cap that was later connected to the pre-ampliﬁer. The
pre-ampliﬁed signal was sent to an ampliﬁer and from there to a computer for storage. Our facility has the capability
of continuously monitoring up to 64 tethered or untethered rats. Untethered rats underwent video monitoring and
the tethered rats underwent both video and EEG monitoring. This paper will discuss a novel means of illustrating,
clustering and identifying artifact and seizure clusters using these animals.
2.2. Predicting Epileptogenesis
Studies on clinical ictal activity are generally focused on mechanisms of epilepsy disease [14] , [15], most EEG
studies deal with interictal epileptic activity rather than seizures. It is diﬃcult to predict seizure occurrence due to the
short time of recording and the artifacts generated by movements [16] Because they are considered as an indicator of
the presence of epileptic seizures, and may actually precede a seizure (sentinel spike), the detection of these interictal,
transient spikes which may be confused with artifact or noise is indeed a crucial element in the prediction of epileptic
conditions. Work illustrating how interictal spikes can predict seizures by six seconds has been accepted in the
community by using Deterministic Finite Automata [17], [18], [19]. Robustness of these predictive algorithms was
attained by adding Spectral Analysis [20], [21], variant domains [22] and neurophysiological artiﬁcial intelligence
[23]. The problem that our hypothesis focused on is that these interictal spikes do not always precede a seizure. It

434

follows that a more robust seizure detection mechanism can only be obtained when a substantially more objective
means of having a machine identify when a seizure is occurring, or what is a seizure and what his not a seizure. This
paper illustrates how the authors set up experiments to prove our hypothesis and how the results of our experiments
provide a novel means to program a machine to identify seizures.
3. Background: Clustering
Clustering algorithms group similar patterns together, ﬁnd application in pattern analysis, decision making and
various machine learning problems. Clustering algorithms [24] essentially fall into either hierarchical or partitional
clustering algorithms. Hierarchical algorithms produce a hierarchy of clusters. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering
algorithms initially treat each pattern as a separate cluster and merge clusters recursively based on their distance from
each other until a single cluster containing all the sought after patterns is obtained [25]. Our hypothesis is that if one
were to cluster change of time for the x-axis and area under the curve then objects representing artifact will remain
stationary in continuous clustered segments while objects representing seizure activity should move. Speciﬁcally,
our objective is to partition a data set X into c clusters where we assume that c is known or it is a trial value of
which partition results must be validated [26]. With classical sets we deﬁne a hard partition as a family of of subsets
{Ai |1 ≤ i ≤ c ⊂ P(X)} where Ai contains all the data in X, which must be disjoint, not empty nor contains all the data
c
μAi = 1, ii) μAi ∨ μA j , 1 ≤ i
j ≤ c and iii)
in X. These three parameters in membership functions are, i) Vi=1
0 < μAi < 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ c where the function μAi represents the subset Ai which can be zero or one and in simplifying
it we use μi rather than μAi . Our objective was to ﬁrst use K-means and K-medoid algorithms which required hard
partitioning and compare those results against Fuzzy K-means algorithm, requiring fuzzy partitioning, because for
the system to work autonomously, a decision regarding supervised or unsupervised leaning will have to be made, i.e.,
comparing the hard and fuzzing partitioning at this stage is critical. To this end we deﬁned hard and fuzzy partitioning
in context to one another where in a hard partitioning space we let X = [x1 , x1 , ..., xN ] represent the ﬁnite set where
2 ≤ c ≤ N be an integer where the hard partitioning space for X is the set

However, we need μik to attain real values in [0,1] therefore we used Fuzzy partitioning as a generalization of hard
partitioning where we let X = [x1 , x1 , ..., xN ] represent the ﬁnite set where 2 ≤ c ≤ N be an integer where the fuzzy
partitioning space for X is the set

where the i-th column of U contains values of the membership function of the i-th fuzzy subset of X and constrains
the sum of each column to 1. This means that total membership of each xk in X equals one making the distribution of
our memberships, artifact or seizure amongst the c fuzzy subsets unconstrained and ﬂexible in nature.
3.1. Hard Partitioning: K-means & K-medoid Algorithms
The authors believe that the dimensionality problem can be solved by allowing partial membership. The Fuzzy
set theory [27] provides useful concepts and tools to deal with imprecise information. Partial membership allows
that the information about more complex situations, such as cover mixture or intermediate conditions, can be better

represented and utilized [28]. The k-means and k-medoid algorithms divide the data set up into groups and attempt
to accurately measure the distance between points in a cluster and a singular point deemed to be at the center of its
cluster. The k-means algorithm partitions n observations into k clusters where each observation is a member of the
cluster with the nearest mean. The k-medoid algorithm chooses data points as centers (medoids or exemplars). For
our k-means algorithm the authors allocate each data point to one of c clusters to minimize the within-cluster sum
squares [29], [30] ci−1 k∈Ai ||xk − vi ||2 where Ai is a set of objects in the i-th cluster and vi is the mean for the points

Ni , xk ∈ A1
where Ni is the number of objects in Ai K-medoid is a classical partitioning technique of clustering that clusters the
data set of N objects into c clusters known a priori. Here the cluster centers are the nearest objects to the mean of data
in one cluster V = {vi ∈ X|1 ≤ i ≤ c}

3.2. Fuzzy Partitioning: Fuzzy C-Means Algorithm
The authors considered that becasue it is known that every algorithm that only uses inner products can implicitly
be executed in the feature space that we could start with the original fuzzy c-means algorithm introduced by Dunn in
1974 [31], which he based on the minimization of an objective function called C-means functional. Dunn deﬁnes Vi
as the weighted mean of the data items belonging to a speciﬁc cluster, where the weights are the membership degrees.

that m is the weighting exponent on each fuzzy membership and determines the amount of fuzziness of the resulting
classiﬁcation. For clustering in a manner that artifact and seizure will be separated from the grey area, it seemed a
viable option to also include FCM because the FCM objective function is minimized when high membership values
are assigned to pixels whose intensities are close to the centroid of its particular class, and low membership values are
assigned when the point is far from the centroid [32].
4. Experiments
4.1. Overview
EEG data derived from the itracortical electrodes placed stereotaxically in the hippocampus and dura of the rats is
ampliﬁed and recorded in ASCI ﬁles 24/7. When the animal has a seizure the authors sliced the ASCII ﬁle 2 minutes
before the seizure occurred and ended it 60 seconds after what experts agree was the end of the seizure event.. Dental
cement was applied to hold the electrode pins together in a plastic cap that was later connected to the pre-ampliﬁer.
Manipulation of the ASCI ﬁles was performed by Mathematica 8, MatLab and our custom-developed digital signal
processing (DSP) software using .NET 4.0 and C#. In the next step the authors imported the ASCI data using our DSP
which then applied visualizations of the signal by projecting the sample points making up the signal. Once created
we projected a mean spline through the signal see (see Figure 1a), where it calculated the area of the curves under and
above the mean spline (see Figure 1b. Then we exported the absolute values of the calculated areas into segmented and

overlapped time windows. The authors coded clustering for Mathematica and speciﬁc K-Means, K-medoid and fuzzy
c-means in Matlab to automatically create animated plots showing clustering by change in time vs. area under/above
(abs) the mean spline.
4.2. Data
In this experiment the authors examined seizures of ten rat data ﬁles containing epileptic seizure activity recorded
on three independent channels. It became apparent6, with the naked eye that a signature pattern of movement was
becoming evident once the animals began to have their seizures. The concentrated regions all take place between
oﬀsets 160,00 and 170,000, and continued through the remaining data in the ﬁles totaling 2.33 minutes of data. the
authors have, and still are continuing to experiment with how long the time windows used for exporting should be. At
the time of this paper, a time window of eight seconds with a seven second overlap was determined to be adequate for
analysis. The illustrations of clustered movement are based on this time window coupled with a mean spline averaged
and interpolated for every one hundred ﬁfty points over the entire signal.

5. Results
5.1. Graphical Context
After running seizures of 10 rats through the system Figure 4 is representative of the cluster movements of all the
rats. These four stages include the rest or normal state represented in the top left image. The rat is sleeping or eating
and all is normal as the clusters indicate. However, after the interictal spike, the top right hand image shows a traveling
of the centroid up along the y-axis. NO rat had a traveling cluster in any other direction during this ﬁrst stage which
is remarkable. Then in the bottom left hand image one observes the clusters returning to the (0,0) position. Finally in
the second half of the seizure the centroid move at an incredible speed towards the upper right hand side of the chart.

6. Conclusion and Future Work
Our conclusion is that based oﬀ the animals tested and the continuous results justifying our hypothesis, that we can
state that in a domain of time versus amplitudinal strength in encephalograms of a rat during seizure, artifact remain
stationary in continuous clustered segments while seizure activity should move. However, for future work the authors
have implanted intracortical electrodes into 20 new animals that will vein seizing in March, 2012. At this point we will
record these seizures and rerun these experiments. The authors will also work on ﬁnding a better means to combine
the seizures of many rats onto one graph and, if possible, determine a means to ﬁnd a vector-driven mechanism to
measure velocity and angles of seizures.
