Abstract. The SDE-Solver software package is our own professional
C++ program, designed as a scientiﬁc computing tool serving for computer construction of solutions to a wide class of systems of stochastic
diﬀerential equations (SDEs), including a broad class of diﬀusions with
jumps driven by a number of non-Gaussian random measures. It has been
developed as an application to the Windows system and its shareware
version is available with a monograph [4].
In this paper we shortly explain what new ideas have been used in order
to get useful statistical and visual information on the time evolution of
stochastic processes serving as solutions to such SDEs.
Monte Carlo simulations, statistical estimation methods, approximate
numerical algorithms, and modern computer visualization techniques applied together allow for constructing solutions to the wide class of semimartingale stochastic diﬀerential equations.
In this way the SDE-Solver package (as other scientiﬁc computing tools)
can be successfully applied in searching for proper and reliable stochastic
models of real-life phenomena subject to random non-Gaussian disturbances and in studying their various properties.

Introduction

It is commonly understood that any continuous diﬀusion process {X(t): t ≥ 0}
with given drift and dispersion coeﬃcients a = a(t, x) and b = b(t, x), can be
obtained as a solution of the scalar Itˆo stochastic diﬀerential equation

where {B(t)}t≥0 stands for the Brownian motion process deﬁned on a probability space (Ω, F, P, {Ft }t≥0 ). The solution is a real valued and {Ft }t≥0 -adapted
diﬀusion process {X(t): t ≥ 0}.

driven by α-stable L´evy process {Lα,β (t): t ≥ 0} (see e.g. [2] and [3]), and by
compensated Poisson process {Nλ (t): t ≥ 0} (see [4]).
Both types of stochastic equations described above are special cases of general
stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by semimartingales, i.e. equations in the
following form
t

X(t) = X0 +

f (X(s−)) dY (s);

X(0) = X0 ,

where {Y (t)} stands for a given semimartingale process (for the theorems on
existence and uniqueness of solutions consult e.g. Protter [8] and the bibliography
therein).
In this paper we brieﬂy demonstrate a necessity of application of SDE (2) and
systems of SDEs presented below in a vector equation (4) to stochastic modelling
of real-life phenomena, and at the same time we try to show the usefulness of
the SDE-Solver package, choosing as an example a competing species problem
well known in biology. The vast variety of such examples is considered in [3] and
[4]. One of our latest works, i.e. [6], is related to the construction of optimal
portfolio of an investor in a stochastic ﬁnancial market.

A Class of SDEs Solvable with the SDE-Solver Software
Package

The user friendly SDE-Solver package provides the user with computer produced
solutions to a wide class of SDEs with given Cauchy type initial conditions. This
means that the package oﬀers information on time evolution of the n-dimensional
stochastic process
X = {X(t): t ∈ [t0 , T ]} = {(X1 (t), . . . , Xn (t)) : t ∈ [t0 , T ]} ,
solving the n-dimensional SDE, written in the following integral form

with initial conditions deﬁned by the vector of n deterministic or random components
X0 = (X0,1 , . . . , X0,n ) .
Functional coeﬃcients of (4) are of the following form
a : IR+ × IRn −→ IRn ,
b : IR+ × IRn −→ IRn×m1 ,
c : IR+ × IRn −→ IRn×m2 ,
what means that they are functions deﬁned on IR+ × IRn with vector or matrix values, and Lα,

¯ (t) are m1 -dimensional and

stochastic processes

¯ β¯ (t) = Lα1 ,β1 (t), . . . , Lαj ,βj (t), . . . , Lαm1 ,βm1 (t)

where {Lαj ,βj }, for j = 1, . . . , m1 , constitute a set of m1 independent scalar
αj -stable L´evy processes, with αj ∈ (0, 2], βj ∈ [−1, 1]. Similarly, a vector
df
¯=
(λ1 , . . . , λm ) stands for a vector valued process
λ

Nλ¯ (t) = Nλ1 (t), . . . , Nλj (t), . . . , Nλm2 (t)
with m2 independent components in a form of scalar Poisson processes Nλj with
given intensities λj > 0.
In basic mathematical theoretical textbooks (see e.g. [8] and the literature
cited there and in [3]) the general semimartingale stochastic diﬀerential equation
is considered.
Such equation is written in a shortened general form
d X(t) = f (X(t−)) d Z(t);

X(0) = X0 ,

(5)

where Z(t) = {Z(t)}t≥0 stands for a given (vector valued) semimartingale. Our
family of systems of SDEs, deﬁned by (4), can be interpreted as a (quite important) subfamily of general semimartingale SDEs. It is enough to construct a
vector function
f : IRn+1 −→ IR(n+1)×(1+m1 +m2 ) ,
properly placing function parameters a, b, c from (4) in the deﬁnition of f. In this
way we get immediately theorems on existence and uniqueness of solutions and
even appropriate theorems on convergence of some numerical discrete methods
(but not on the speed of convergence). Computer construction of approximate
solutions to still wider class of stochastic diﬀerential equations driven by general
L´evy processes and some problems related to convergence of proposed methods
are discussed in [5].

Numerical Approximation of SDEs with Jumps

For simplicity we will consider here only the scalar SDE (4), i.e. we assume that
n = 1. We believe that it is quite obvious how to extend numerical schemes
presented here to the case of systems of SDEs of the form (4) with n > 1.
We have

(6)

By numerical approximation or discretization of a given stochastic process
X = {X(t): t ∈ [t0 , T ]} we understand here a ﬁnite family of explicitly known
random variables {Xiτ : i = 0, 1, . . . , I}, such that Xiτ ≈ X(ti ) on a given grid of
I + 1 points ti = t0 + i τ , for τ = (T − t0 )/I.
The Euler schema for (6) can be written in the following form

counting the number of jumps of the process Nλl on the interval [ti , ti−1 ).
The computer techniques of visualization of a single trajectory of a solution

Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Time
Evolution of Stochastic Processes

Now we describe brieﬂy computer methods developed in our software package
SDE-Solver. Most of them are not in a common usage when solving SDEs even
in a classical Itˆo form. Here we present much more on the topic than one can
ﬁnd in any textbook (see e.g. [7] for comparison) or in available literature on
application of computer methods in stochastic modelling.
In order to simplify the presentation we assume that an unknown stochastic
process X = {X(t): t ∈ [t0 , T ]} is to be approximated with a family of random
I
variables {Xiτ }i=1 , and further on by a family of pseudo random samples
τ

{X i (ωk )}K

,

as is explained in Sect. 3.
Now we show how to get qualitative and quantitative information on a time
evolution of the process X.
4.1

Visualization of Trajectories

The common technique of visualization of any stochastic process is a graphical
construction of its single approximate trajectory. It is enough to ﬁx properly a
τ
value of a parameter I = Ir , compute (ti , X i (ωk )) for i = 0, 1, . . . , Ir , and chose
ωk ∈ Ω. Finally, joining neighbour points by strait lines we get an approximate
graph, appropriate in the case of a continuous trajectories of X, as it is correct
for Itˆ
o diﬀusions. For jump diﬀusions it is necessary to notify in some way the
jumps of trajectories. This important in case of solutions to (6). In our package
it is possible to produce pictures of many trajectories on a given ﬁgure.

Approximate Quantile Lines

The notion of a p-quantile line does not appear in an available statistical literature in a context of approximate construction of solutions to SDEs.
For a ﬁxed p ∈ (0, 1) and a given stochastic process X = {X(t): t ∈ [t0 , T ]}
by a p-quantile line we understand a deterministic function qp = qp (t) on an
interval [t0 , T ] such that
IP{X(t) ≤ qp (t)} = p;

t ∈ [t0 , T ] .

(11)

Computer construction of such function can be reduced to the estimation of
τ
I
a p-quantile for all or some of ordered random samples {{X i,(k) }K
k=1 }i=0 . In this
way we get numbers
qpτ (i) ≈ qp (ti )
(12)
for all i = 0, 1, . . . , I or for some subsequence of available values of i.
Joining pairs of points ti−1 , qpτ (i − 1) , ti , qpτ (i) for i = 1, 2, . . . , I, we get
a graph qpτ = qpτ (t) approximating unknown p-quantile line qp = qp (t) on the
interval [t0 , T ], i.e. a visualization of time evolution of a p-quantile of X.
4.3

Estimation of Time Evolution of Densities

Specialists in stochastic modelling agree that the time evolution of densities
{ft = f (t; x): x ∈ IR}t∈[t0 ,T ] of a process X = {X(t): t ∈ [t0 , T ]}, or, simdf

ply, a function f = f (t; x) = ft (x), is often an important factor in scientiﬁc
investigation of stochastic models described by SDEs of diﬀerent kinds.
In the case of Itˆo diﬀusions densities f = f (t, x) can be theoretically obtained
from the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov partial diﬀerential equation of parabolic
type. For diﬀusions with jumps – theoretically and practically – the problem is
much more complicated.
τ
I
When we have to our disposal a family {{X i (ωk )}K
k=1 }i=0 of random samples
from unknown probability laws, we can apply to each of them one of well known
nonparametric estimation of densities method, e.g. an eﬃcient in most cases
Rosenblatt-Parzen method. It means that we are able to compute
fl,j

(13)

in order to get a good approximation
fl,j ≈ f (tl , xj ) ,

(14)

of values of unknown densities ftl (x) of random variables X(tl ), on a ﬁnite grid
of points (tl , xj ), for l = 1, 2, . . . , L, j = 1, 2, . . . , J.
This is enough to produce in this way three-dimensional nice approximate
pictures of f = f (t, x) with appropriate computer graphics tools at hand.

Estimation of Time Evolution of Entropies

Having to our disposal a set of numbers {fl,j } coming from (14) we can construct
an entropy function, which can be deﬁned in the following way
df

H(t) = −

∞
−∞

f (t, x) log f (t, x) dx .

(15)

It is enough to compute numerically integrals
Hl ≈ H(tl ) ,

(16)

and ﬁnally to produce an approximate graph of an unknown function H = H(t).
4.5

Functional of a Stochastic Process

An useful tool for investigation of stochastic models arises from the formula
df

F (t) = IE[h(X(t))];

t ∈ [t0 , T ] .

(17)

All values of this deterministic function on [t0 , T ] are determined through the
given properly chosen function h = h(x), as expected values of random variables
h(X(t)). As a special case one can get a time evolution of moments of X, but
we should remember that quite commonly diﬀusions with jumps have no ﬁnite
moments, e.g. diﬀusions driven by α-stable L´evy motion have no ﬁnite moments
of order greater then 1.
In a similar way as before, it is enough to make use of a very simple estimator
F (tl ) ≈

for l = 1, 2, . . . , L.
4.6

Approximation of Wiener Cylindrical Measures

Also a notion of Wiener cylindrical measures does not appear in an available
literature in a context of approximate construction of solutions to SDEs.
If we ﬁx a set of points til from an interval [t0 , T ] and a set of corresponding
intervals [al , bl ], then we can ask for values of the following expressions
IP{X(til ) ∈ [al , bl ]: l = 1, 2, . . . , L}

(19)

or
IP{X(til ) ∈ [al , bl ]},

l = 1, 2, . . . , L,

(20)

known as a Wiener cylindrical measure of a product [a1 , b1 ] × . . . × [aL , bL ].
When we have to our disposal a set of approximate trajectories of X, large
enough, than in an obvious way we are able to compute frequencies of trajectories of X satisfying such conditions as above. This method provides us with
acceptable approximate values of the probabilities from (19) and (20).

Examples of Stochastic Diﬀerential Equations

The SDE-Solver package can serve as a powerfull tool for construction and analyzis of stochastic models describing real-life problems coming from such ﬁelds as
mathematical and statistical physics, chemistry, biology, engineering, stochastic
mathematical ﬁnance, etc. (see e.g. [1], [3], [7], [11]). In [3] a variety of examples
of results of computer simulations with the use of our methods and previous
versions of the SDE-Solver package can also be found.
Here we present in more detail an interesting example of a system of two
stochastic equations coming from biology.

Volterry-Lotka Equation as a Stochastic Model of
Competing Species

Here we present the two-dimensional stochastic generalization of the deterministic Volterry-Lotka model of competing species, which can be described by the
following Gauss-Poisson system of SDEs

For computer simulations we ﬁxed the following values of parameters of a
system of equations: a1 = 3, b11 = −1, b12 = −2, a2 = 2, b21 = −1, b22 = −1.
For parameters describing random measures in our system of 2 SDEs we have
found: σ1 = 0.05, σ2 = 0.05, ν1 = −0.5, λ1 = 0.1, ν2 = 0.25, λ2 = 0.1.
Initial values are the most interesting for X(0) = 1, Y (0) = 1.
The Gauss-Poisson model with jumps (21) with these ﬁxed values of parameters is favorable for the second species, ’oﬀering’ for it an explosive growth
(ν2 > 0) in random times, while the ﬁrst species suﬀers serious sudden decline
in number (ν1 < 0) from time to time. Precisely, in our semimartingale model
we get
IP{X(t) ∈ [0.5, 3.5]} = IP{Y (t) ∈ [−0.3, 0.3]} ≈ 0.832,

for t ≥ 30 ,

what means that in this model the probability of survival for the second species
is about 83.2%.
One can check that the situation of the ﬁrst species is much better in Gaussian
model, where σ1 = σ2 = 0, ν1 = ν2 = 0. In this case we obtain

370

A. Janicki, A. Izydorczyk, and P. Gradalski

IP{X(t) ∈ [0.5, 3.5]} = IP{Y (t) ∈ [−0.3, 0.3]} ≈ 0.488,

for t ≥ 30 ,

what means that in this model the probability of winning for the ﬁrst species is
about 51.2%.
Figures 1 and 2 represent both components of the solution (X(t), Y (t)) to
the system of SDEs (21), for t ∈ [0, 30].
They are visualized with the help of 20 exemplary trajectories, 9 quantile
lines, and 2 cylindrical probability measures, which were computed after producing 2 000 trajectories of the solution.
We can see the inﬂuence of the Poisson random measure on the solution
(X(t), Y (t)).
The set of 9 quantile lines (deciles) helps to follow time dynamics of the
modelled event.
