2 Approximation Using a Hessian Matrix
Vector fields are approximated using only linear approximation to determine the local behavior of
the vector field [1]. However, linearization gives us only a basic classification of the critical points and
basic information about the flow around them; the approximation using second order derivatives will
give us some more information.
An approximation of the vector field around a critical point using a second order derivative must be
written for each vector component (𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥 and 𝑣𝑣𝑦𝑦 ) separately; see the following equation for 𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥 :



where ∆𝑥𝑥 = 𝑥𝑥 − 𝑥𝑥0 , ∆𝑦𝑦 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑦𝑦0 , ∆𝒙𝒙 = [∆𝑥𝑥, ∆𝑦𝑦]𝑇𝑇 , 𝑯𝑯𝑥𝑥 is Hessian matrix, 𝑱𝑱𝑥𝑥 is the first row of a
Jacobian matrix. Equation for 𝑣𝑣𝑦𝑦 is similar as for 𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥 .
A Hessian matrix is a square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function,
or scalar field. It describes the local curvature of a function of many variables.
An approximation of a vector field using  is a bit more computationally expensive than the
standard linear approximation, but gives us a more detailed description than a linear approximation of a
vector field, see Fig. 2. The approximation in Fig. 2 (𝑡𝑡 ≠ 0) gives us the same information as in Fig. 2
(𝑡𝑡 = 0), although we can see the curvature of the two main axes for the saddle.

3 Curvature of a Vector Field

An approximated vector field using  is not only linear but contains the Hessian matrices that
describe the local curvature of the vector field. In this section, an approach for computing the local
curvature of a vector field that is approximated with Jacobian and Hessian matrices is introduced.
Using an approximation of the vector field with second order derivatives gives us the opportunity to
compute a Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 in the neighborhood of a critical point from approximated vector field :



Elements of 𝑱𝑱, 𝑯𝑯𝑥𝑥  and 𝑯𝑯𝑦𝑦 are all elements used to calculate 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 in  and , so there is no need to
compute any additional derivatives than those in . Note that the Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 is for 𝜺𝜺 = [0,0]𝑇𝑇
equal to Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱. The Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 can be computed for any point (𝒙𝒙𝟎𝟎 + 𝜺𝜺). Therefore,
we start by computing the eigenvectors of Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱 in a critical point 𝒙𝒙0 .
There are two eigenvectors (𝒖𝒖1 and 𝒖𝒖2 ) for a Jacobian matrix in 2𝐷𝐷. In the case that the vector field
is circular around the critical point, we will use only the real part of the eigenvectors, i.e.
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑎𝑎 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏) = 𝑎𝑎
𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼(𝑎𝑎 + 𝑏𝑏𝑏𝑏) = 𝑏𝑏

𝑎𝑎, 𝑏𝑏 ∈ ℝ .

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 )
ℎ
‖𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 )‖

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 )
ℎ
‖𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 )‖



To calculate the curvature of the vector field we need to compute the eigenvectors in the near
surroundings of the critical point as will be explained later. First, we need to compute vectors pointing
from 𝒙𝒙0 in the direction of the main axes of the vector field, i.e.
𝜺𝜺1𝐿𝐿 = −

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 )
ℎ
‖𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 )‖

𝜺𝜺2𝐿𝐿 = −

𝜺𝜺1𝑅𝑅 =

𝜺𝜺2𝑅𝑅 =

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 )
ℎ ,
‖𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 )‖



where ℎ is some small number (e.g. ℎ = 10−3 for the vector field in Fig. 2).
In the next step, we calculate Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 for all vectors computed in , i.e. the Jacobian
matrix at points (𝒙𝒙0 + 𝜺𝜺∗∗ ):
𝑱𝑱1𝐿𝐿 = 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 (𝜺𝜺1𝐿𝐿 )

𝑱𝑱2𝐿𝐿 = 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 (𝜺𝜺2𝐿𝐿 )

𝑱𝑱1𝑅𝑅 = 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 (𝜺𝜺1𝑅𝑅 )

𝑱𝑱2𝑅𝑅 = 𝑱𝑱𝜀𝜀 (𝜺𝜺2𝑅𝑅 ) .



For each Jacobian matrix in  we need to calculate the real parts of both eigenvectors and
determine which one is pointing in almost the same direction as the original eigenvector 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 ) for 𝑱𝑱1𝐿𝐿
and 𝑱𝑱1𝑅𝑅 and determine 𝒖𝒖1𝐿𝐿 and 𝒖𝒖1𝑅𝑅 , respectively; similarly eigenvector 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 ) for 𝑱𝑱2𝐿𝐿 and 𝑱𝑱2𝑅𝑅 and
determine 𝒖𝒖2𝐿𝐿 and 𝒖𝒖2𝑅𝑅 . This test can be done using the dot product between original eigenvector
𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖𝑖𝑖 ), where 𝑖𝑖 = {1, 2}, and both real parts of eigenvectors for Jacobian matrix 𝑱𝑱𝑖𝑖∗ in . The closest
two vectors, i.e. vectors with a minimal angle between them, have the greatest dot product. Therefore,
for each directional vector in  we get one vector, thus four vectors 𝒖𝒖1𝐿𝐿 , 𝒖𝒖1𝑅𝑅 , 𝒖𝒖2𝐿𝐿 and 𝒖𝒖2𝑅𝑅 , i.e., for
example, 𝒖𝒖1𝐿𝐿 is computed as the following procedure:
{ 1𝝃𝝃1𝐿𝐿 , 2𝝃𝝃1𝐿𝐿 } = 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒(𝑱𝑱1𝐿𝐿 ))

𝝃𝝃1𝐿𝐿 ∙ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 ) > 2𝝃𝝃1𝐿𝐿 ∙ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 )
.

𝝃𝝃1𝐿𝐿 ∙ 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒(𝒖𝒖1 ) > 2𝝃𝝃1𝐿𝐿 ∙ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 )



The curvature vectors of a vector field are computed as follows:
𝒄𝒄1 =

1 𝒖𝒖1𝑅𝑅
𝒖𝒖1𝐿𝐿
(
−
)
2ℎ ‖𝒖𝒖1𝑅𝑅 ‖ ‖𝒖𝒖1𝐿𝐿 ‖

𝒄𝒄2 =

1 𝒖𝒖2𝑅𝑅
𝒖𝒖2𝐿𝐿
(
−
) .
2ℎ ‖𝒖𝒖2𝑅𝑅 ‖ ‖𝒖𝒖2𝐿𝐿 ‖



This is a discrete formula for curvature calculation using the difference between two unit vectors. The
important property of the curvature vectors in  is the perpendicularity to 𝑅𝑅𝑒𝑒(𝒖𝒖1 ), resp. 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 ), i.e.
𝒄𝒄1 ∙ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖1 ) = 0

𝒄𝒄2 ∙ 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅(𝒖𝒖2 ) = 0 .



The length of the curvature vectors in  is a number that characterizes how much each of the main
axes of the vector field is curved. In the case that both curvatures are equal to zero, then matrices 𝑯𝑯𝑥𝑥
and 𝑯𝑯𝑦𝑦 must be zero matrices; otherwise at least one of the curvatures is nonzero.

4 Example of Vector Field Curvature
The vector field around a critical point can be classified as one of the vector types [1]. This section
presents examples of how the vector field approximated with the same Jacobian matrix changes when
changing the Hessian matrices used to approximate the vector field around a critical point.
An example of the vector field around a saddle point can be characterized with the following
approximation:
1 ∆𝑥𝑥 𝑇𝑇 1.2

where 𝑡𝑡 ∈ ℝ is a parameter. If we continuously change the parameter 𝑡𝑡, the vector field will change
continuously as well, i.e. there will be no discontinuity.
As an example, the parameter 𝑡𝑡 ∈ 〈−1; 1〉 was changed and both curvatures of the main axes
of the vector field were calculated. It can be seen that both the curvatures change continuously (see
results in Fig. 1). For parameter 𝑡𝑡 = 0, the vector field is approximated only with the Jacobian matrix
part of , i.e.
𝑣𝑣𝑥𝑥 = [1.2

1.4] ∙ [∆𝑥𝑥

𝑣𝑣𝑦𝑦 = [0.7

and both the curvatures are thus equal to 0.

Fig. 1. Progress of both curvatures when changing parameter 𝑡𝑡 ∈ 〈−1; 1〉 in . One curvature grows faster with a greater
absolute value of 𝑡𝑡. This means that one main axis is more curved than the other.

The approximated vector field represented by  can be seen for different values of parameter 𝑡𝑡 in
Fig. 2. It can be seen that the vector field has a different phase portrait for different values 𝑡𝑡; however,
all of them have the same description using a linear approximation of the vector field around a critical
point.

5 Conclusion
A new and easy algorithm for calculating the curvature of vector fields has been presented. It uses
second order partial derivatives for an approximation of a vector field around a critical point. This
approximation gives us a more detailed description of the vector field close to the critical point than the
standardly used linear approximation.
The algorithm was presented for 2𝐷𝐷 flow fields because of their simplicity and clarity, but it can in
general be used with no modifications for 𝑁𝑁 dimensional vector flow fields.
