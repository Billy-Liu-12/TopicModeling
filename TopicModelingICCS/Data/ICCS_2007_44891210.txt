Abstract. Basing on the existing thermo-hydro-mechanical constitutive model
presented in reference[1], and the chemo-mechanical constitutive model
presented in reference[2], a coupled chemo-thermo-hydro-mechanical(CTHM)
constitutive model of porous media is developed in the present paper. The
chemoplastic and thermoplastic coupling behavior is considered in the present
constitutive model. The present coupled CTHM constitutive model has been
integrated into the coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical mathematical model
including contaminant translation in porous media. The numerical results are
illustrated to particularly emphasize the effects of the contaminant concentration
and temperature to the coupled CTHM system in porous media.
Keywords: porous media, chemo-thermo-hydro-mechanical, constitutive model, coupling.

1 Introduction
In the recent years, the coupled chemo-thermo-hydro-mechanical(CTHM) behavior of
porous media has attracted comprehensive attentions in engineering practice.
The thermo-plasticity of clay is charactered with the thermo-softening on cohesion
and pre-consolidation pressure in the constitutive model. Wu[1] developed a THM
constitutive model for unsaturated clay. The concept of chemical softening was
suggested by Hueckel[2] to describe the chemo-plastic response of clay. Liu[3]
developed this model into a couple chemo-hydro-mechanical constitutive model of
unsaturated clay.
The present CTHM constitutive model is developed on the basis of the CAP model
for unsaturated porous media with integration of the thermal and chemical effects on
the hydro-mechanical behavior into the model.

2 The Constitutive Model and the Consistence Algorithm
This model is composed of four yield surfaces: The State Boundary Surface[1,4], The
Critical State Line[1,4], The Suction Increase Curve [1,4] and The Traction Model[1]:

The cohesion is written in the form:

(

)

p s ε p , s, T , c = p s (0, Tr ) + h p ε p + k ps s + k pc c

(5)

where ps(0,Tr) is the cohesion with s=0, c=0 and T=Tr. hp, kps, kpc are the material
parameters. The pre-consolidation pressure defines as:

(

)

p0 c ε vp , s, T , c = p0 (ε vp , s, T ) exp(−α c c )

(6)

where α c is a chemical-softening parameter. The preconsolidation pressure p0 (ε vp , s, T )
with c=0 is still described in format of Loading-Collapse(LC) curve[1,4].
The strain rate is written as:
εij = εijp + εijm,e + εijs ,e + εijT ,e + εijc ,e

The elastic strains[1,2] are given by:

κ is elastic stiffness parameter for changes in suction, α 2 is the thermal expansion

parameter. The chemical expansion coefficient is written in positive form[2,3]:
β = F0 β 0 exp[β 0 (1 − c + ln c )](1 / c − 1)

The plastic potential function g has the same form of yield function with dilated angle.
The plastic strain rate vector is defined by the non-associated flow rule:
εijp = λ p

For a specific yield surface, the consistent condition can be written as:

f =

To derive the general form of the constitutive equations, the stress can be written as:

3 Numerical Results
We consider a circular tunnel of 5m diameter at 220m depth excavated in unsaturated
clay[3]. F0=0.04. The other parameters can be found in reference [1], [3].
Two cases are analyzed p0*=1000Mpa and p0*=2MPa. Let us consider the state of the
clay at time t=3*108s. The results around the tunnel are plotted (Fig. 2-7). These
distributions are quite axisymmetrical in the region around the tunnel subjected to
coupling effects. In fact, the influence of the variation of in situ stresses due to gravity is
much smaller than the coupling influence and is negligible on the resulting stress and
strain distributions. Figure 4 indicates that the coupling effects induce an expansion of
the clay, whereas neglected volume change observed without the effect of c,T (Fig. 5).
Regarding shear strains, the coupling effects are quite similar in both cases, inducing a
significant increase of shear strains close to the tunnel (Fig. 6,7).

4 Conclusions and Discussion
The numerical results show the influence of coupling effect on the behavior around the
tunnel during excavation. It is concluded that environmental load plays an important
role in generating response and needs to be clearly articulated in the formulation of the
problem. The proposed model may be a useful tool in designing this type of
experiment, or as a matter of fact, field studies.
