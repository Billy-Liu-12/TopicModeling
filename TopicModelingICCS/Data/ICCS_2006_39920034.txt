Abstract. The time-dependent Maxwell’s equations are solved for mobile device applications using a multilevel-multigrid ﬁnite-diﬀerence timedomain (FDTD) method. For three-dimensional models that simulate
system level details of mobile devices, the smallest features are in the
nanometre (10−9 m) range, leading to a time-step size in the attosecond
(10−18 s) range. The feature sizes of mobile devices are in the centimetre
(10−2 m) range, while for health and safety studies that include human
models features are in the metre range.

Introduction

The drive towards compact, lightweight and fast mobile electronic devices has
fuelled the demand for electromagnetic simulations/analyses that employ complete models in ﬁne detail but at the same time show shortened simulation times.
In general, detailed models and faster simulations are not compatible - detailed
models by nature are associated with long computational times. The most popular method for computational electromagnetic simulation, the ﬁnite-diﬀerence
time-domain (FDTD) method [1,2], is no diﬀerent. The FDTD method solves the
time-dependent Maxwell’s equations using the explicit leapfrog time-stepping
scheme. The Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability condition restricts the
size of the time-step directly to the smallest feature in the domain. For threedimensional models that simulate system level details of mobile devices, the
smallest features are in the nanometre (10−9 m) range, leading to a time-step
size in the attosecond (10−18 s) range. The feature sizes of mobile devices are in
the centimetre (10−2 m) range, while for health and safety studies that include
human models features are in the metre range. Direct analysis of such models
with the FDTD method is extremely demanding in both memory and computer
time. Here, we apply the multilevel-multigrid grid embedding approach to address such multiscale simulations in both spatial and temporal spaces. We also

introduce the block-multigrid concept which makes the multigrid FDTD method
even more eﬃcient.

Multilevel-multigrid FDTD Method

In this section, the multilevel-multigrid FDTD method is introduced one element
at a time for clarity, with references being given to more detailed explanations.
First the multigrid FDTD method is introduced, followed by the block-solve
enhancement, and ﬁnally the multilevel element is discussed.
2.1

Multigrid FDTD

The multigrid FDTD method [3-9] solves Maxwell’s equations based on the ﬁnitediﬀerence time-domain (FDTD) method [1,2] for the calculation of electromagnetic wave propagation by strategically embedding ﬁner grids in regions that
require high resolution and not everywhere. Fig. 1 illustrates the grids of normal
FDTD and multigrid FDTD methods. The multigrid approach greatly reduces
memory and computational cost compared with an FDTD method of similar
accuracy. Furthermore, the Cartesian grid used in the ﬁnite-diﬀerence scheme is
considered the most eﬃcient in terms of memory requirement and computational
eﬃciency.
2.2

Block-Solve Multigrid FDTD

For most calculations the multigrid FDTD method is fast and eﬃcient. However,
there are situations where the embedded Cartesian grid is very ineﬃcient, such as
elongated irregular signal-line type structures. Owing to the rectangular nature
of Cartesian grids, they can cover large empty spaces. Fig. 2 shows such a model
where the embedded grid (the rectangle covering the signal-line structure) is
covering some 50 per cent of empty signal-line space as illustrated by the two
dotted-line ovals. Naturally, removing such empty space will reduce memory

requirements and the number of calculations thus shortening the solution time.
Fig. 3 shows a conﬁguration of three embedded grids covering the signal-line
structure.
Applying the multigrid FDTD method directly to the model in Fig. 3 will
give an incorrect solution. This is because the temporal space at the adjoining
interface between the grids in the ﬁne-grid time-step level is not directly communicated. Instead, it is via the coarse grid where it is interpolated with the
rest of the boundary from coarse-grid values. Therefore, a modiﬁcation to the
solution procedure to include the exchange of values between adjoining grids at
each embedded time-step level is required. The block-solve solution procedure
for multigrid FDTD is detailed in [10] and will not be repeated here.

2.3

Multilevel-multigrid FDTD

Fig. 4 shows a multilevel grid conﬁguration (in two dimensions) of three levels of grid embedding, with each embedded grid ﬁner than the one before. The
multilevel-multigrid FDTD method [11] provides a reﬁnement process where the
grid cell aspect scale changes gradually as opposed to a severe change. This reﬁnement applies to both spatial and temporal spaces. Thus, a gradual reﬁnement
is commonly a more stable approach than a severe change all at once.

Example Model and Results

Fig. 5 shows a simple example model with geometric scale aspect ratio of about
1,000 between the smallest feature in the model and the largest. The smallest
feature is the coil wire width of 1 micrometre (10−6 m) and the largest component
is the strip-line with a length in the millimetre range.
Table 1 shows ﬁve grid models and their respective results. The ﬁrst two grid
models, coarse and ﬁne grids, are for the standard FDTD method. The ﬁne
grid model is created by reﬁning the coarse grid with a reﬁnement factor of 2.
The coarse grid model has one cell for the width of the coil wire, and the ﬁne
grid has four (2x2) cells due to the reﬁnement of 2. The respective time-step
sizes calculated from the CFL stability condition are 2.07 and 1.035 picoseconds
(10−15 s).
The other grid models are for the multilevel-multigrid FDTD method and
a reﬁnement of 2 is applied at each grid level. The third grid model (MG 1level) has one level of embedded grid, so the base grid has the same time-step
size as the coarse grid model. The fourth grid model (MG 4-levels) has four
levels of grid reﬁnement at the coil region (giving one cell for the width of
the coil wire) and one level at the port regions. The ﬁnal grid model (MG 5levels) has ﬁve levels of grid reﬁnement at the coil region, giving four (2x2) cells

for the width of the coil wire and, as for the fourth model, one level at the
port regions. The last two grid models both have a base-grid time-step of 33.56
picoseconds.
The 1-level embedded grid model attains a speedup of 4.1 compared with the
ﬁne grid model, whereas the 5-levels model attains a 4.78 speedup. The 4-level
embedded grid model attains a 2.16 speedup compared with the coarse grid
model.
Fig. 6 shows the S-parameter for all the grid models. There is good agreement between the ﬁne grid and multilevel-multigrid FDTD methods up to 15
GHz, with slight deviations starting to appear above 15 GHz. Also, the plot
shows that the coarse grid result has the worst result due to insuﬃcient grid
resolution.

Conclusions

We have used a multilevel-multigrid approach to address multiscale problems
for three-dimensional electromagnetic wave propagation. The result obtained
for features in the micrometre (10−6 ) range is encouraging. The challenge now
is to advance the technique to the nanometre (10−9 ) range.
