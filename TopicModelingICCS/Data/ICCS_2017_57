common practice to facilitate the study of particles’ motion is using optical tweezers [1]. This
technique exerts a restoring force under the object, allowing the experimentalist to move the
particle inside the fluid in a quasi-twodimensional plane. Many optical tweezers set-ups allow
to trap several objects, but single-particle tracking is usually employed to improve spatial and
temporal resolution.
During the last decades, optical traps have permitted to develop a wide variety of experiments in colloidal motion. To cite some examples: about the effects caused by confinement
[21], the hydrodynamic interaction between particles [10], discovering resonances from hydrodynamic memory at short-time scales [15], regarding micro-rheology [31], or even to produce
Brownian Carnot engines [26], along with many other applications [16].
In spite of the evident benefits of optical tweezers in the research of colloidal physics, this
experimental methodology generates an external force under the bead which can modify the
dynamics of the particle [25]. This force can be also itself modified by the thermo-physical
properties of the surrounding complex fluid [7]. Therefore, a good dynamical characterization
of the external harmonic potential detected by stochastic particle motion is needed to correctly
measure the values of the diffusion coefficient.
Here, we study by experimental-like computer simulations the diffusion of a single sphere
observed in a two-dimensional plane under optical tweezers, i.e., we investigate the Brownian motion of a disk under harmonic potentials. In this work, we show how the solution of
the Fokker-Planck equation [29] allows us to propose an iterative approach as an alternative
methodology to calculate the diffusion coefficient of the disk. Our objective in this work is to
emulate the dynamics of a trapped single-bead in a video-microscopy experiment by means of
Brownian dynamics simulations. These simulations are designed to be experimental-like using
typical input parameters but without the limitations which appear in an experimental set-up,
like image analysis miscalculations or confinement effects in the bead’s diffusion.

Brownian dynamics simulations

We develop Brownian dynamics simulations, which are a simplification of Stokestian dynamics,
but neglecting hydrodynamic interactions (HI) between particles [18]. Our model of colloidal
fluid is designed to be compared with video-microscopy (VM) experiments, where we can observe
real-time motion of the colloids in two dimensions and where we can storage the particles’
position for defined temporal steps, according to the frame-rate of the camera. The software
simulates a suspension of micro-spheres in a Newtonian fluid in a 2D or pseudo-2D configuration
of sedimented micro-particles [8]. In analogy with a image-based VM lab, we are able to
change external parameters, expressed in physical units, such as the concentration of particles
in the suspension, the viscosity of the fluid, the focal distance, the size of the spheres or the
temperature of the bath.
Our simulation model has been implemented using an open-source Java-based software
named “Easy Java/JavaScript Simulations” (EjsS) [13], allowing to create visual simulations
of physical systems based on ordinary differential equations. The equations described in this
section have been resolved numerically by EjsS using a Euler-Richardson algorithm —alternative
algorithms are available but they provided the same results. This simulation methodology has
been successfully developed and tested in more complex systems composed of many Brownian
particles under different internal and external forces [9, 8].
Theoretically, the movement of particles under thermal fluctuations is studied by means of
the Langevin equation [22], which is the Newton’s second law equation including a stochastic

force FB :
mv̇ = FH + FB + FE + FD

for a sphere of radius a and mass m immersed in a medium of viscosity η and density ρ. In
eq. (1), v is the velocity vector, v̇ ≡ dv/dt, FH are the hydrodynamic forces, FE are external
forces over the particles in the fluid, and FD are hard-disk forces that avoid the particles from
overlapping.
We neglect full hydrodynamic interactions, v̇ ∼ 0, and, therefore, the hydrodynamic contribution is reduced to FH = −γ v, i.e., the Stokes drag of an isolated particle, where γ = 6πηa is
the friction coefficient. This inertial term can be neglected by evaluating the Reynolds number,
Re, which compares inertial and viscous forces. For a bead of radius a immersed in a fluid of
viscosity η and density ρ, we have Re = ρva/η. For micro-particles in water-like fluids, Re is
low enough, allowing us to exclude hydrodynamic interactions when the experimental time-scale
is not very low —in the order of the microsecond.[20] When using HI, the lubrication forces
prevent the particles to overlap. If not, hard-disk forces have to be included. In this work, we
use single-particle configuration, and the hard-disk forces are not necessary.
The Brownian or stochastic force is characterized by FB  = 0 and by FB (0) FB (t) =
2kB T γ δ(t) where kB is the Boltzmann’s constant and δ(t) is the unit tensor [23]. To implement
this force, we use a random vector n with values in the interval [−1, 1] generated by the BoxMuller transformation [2]. Then, we have:

(2)
FB = 2dkB T γ/dt n
where here d is the dimension, and dt will be the time step in the simulations.
Regarding the external forces, we use a restoring Hooke-like one: FE = −κr, where κ is the
trap stiffness and assuming that the trapped disk is centered in its initial position. We do not
include any difference between x and y coordinates, and we can define the harmonic potential
in one-dimension x as Uκ = (1/2) κx2 . This potential is the harmonic approximation for a
trapping potential generated by the focused laser beam of the optical tweezers, which is valid
for the central region of the potential well [30, 28].
Under this conditions, we have the following overdamped Langevin equation for the trapped
disk:
(3)
ṙ = γ −1 (−κr r + FB )

where the stochastic term is given by eq. (2).
Finally, we make the Stokes-Einstein relation for self-diffusion coefficient explicit [12]:
D = kB T γ −1

(4)

This diffusion coefficient, D, is the quantity we want to obtain by analyzing the data of the
simulations. The most simple version of micro-rheology consists in estimating the value of the
fluid’s viscosity, η, by calculating D from the analysis of particle motion in the fluid.

Harmonic potentials in stochastic motion

The solution of the complete set of Langevin equations for a spherical particle in harmonic
potentials with no-slip boundaries in a Newtonian fluid and with hydrodynamic effects [4] only
depends on several timescales: τf ≡ ρf a2 /η, τp∗ ≡ m∗ /γ and τκ ≡ γ/κ. where ρf is the
density of the fluid, mp and the mass of the particle and m∗ ≡ mp + mf /2 is a modified mass
influenced by hydrodynamics, where mf is the mass of the displaced fluid. The two first time

scales are related to fluid vortex propagation and inertial time-scales, whereas τκ measures the
ratio between the Stokes friction coefficient and the optical trap constant, κ.
The most applied statistic magnitude in the analysis of Brownian motion is the mean-square
displacement (MSD), defined by:
MSD(t) ≡ ∆r2 (t) ≡ (r(t) − r(0))2 

(5)

The MSD for a micro-sized particle immersed in a Newtonian fluid, in time scales lower than τκ ,
behaves as MSD(t) = 2dDt, where d is the dimension on the MSD. This expression defines the
diffusive behavior and allows to calculate the diffusion coefficient D. At even lower timescales,
the ballistic regime is predominant initiating a temporal power-law behavior, where MSD(t) ∼
t2 . At higher times, when t ∼ τκ , the optical trap is dominant, and the MSD shows a plateau
equal to MSD(t > τκ ) = 2kB T /κ. The one-dimensional MSD of a harmonically trapped bead
in a Newtonian fluid, without inertia effects, is [6]:
∆x2 (t) =


2kB T 
1 − e−κt/γ
κ

(6)

A standard method to obtain the self-diffusion coefficient is to fit eq. (6) to the MSD data
calculated from the disk’s positions.
An important statistical quantity is the probability distribution of the particles’ jumps, ∆r,
also called Gaussian propagator or van Hove autocorrelation function [19]:


1
∆r2
(7)
exp
−
ρD (∆r, τ ) =

(4πDτ )
for a fixed and constant time-lapse τ between particles’ jumps in d dimensions. If we assume
there is no difference in the diffusion process by using τ (lapse time) or t (absolute time), the
moments
of the distribution can be obtained from the propagator by δrn (t) ≡ |∆r(t)|n  =

n
|∆r| ρD (∆r, t) dd (∆r). And then, the MSD is calculated using n = 2, obtaining δr2 (t) ≡
MSD(t) = 2dDt.
The diffusion coefficient can be extracted from the one-dimensional variance of the Gaussian
distribution (7) since σx2 = 2Dτ . A similar approach can be applied to the trap stiffness
through Boltzmann statistics [14] on the particles’ positions. The average motion of a trapped
particle can be described by means of the probability density distribution ρ(x, t) which obeys
the Fokker-Planck equation [29, 17]. This can be written [5] in a simple one-dimensional form
as dρ(x)/dx = (kB T )−1 F (x)ρ(x). If we use an optical trap modeled as a restoring force with
spring constant κ, the solution is a Gaussian function on the coordinate x:
ρκ (x) =

(8)

The variance of the distribution allows to obtain the stiffness of the trap by σκ2 = kB T /κ. An
example of these one-dimensional distributions can be seen in Fig. 1.
In a more general case of stochastic motion confined by harmonic potentials, the solution of
the Fokker-Plank equation leads to a more complicated distribution [29]. In that situation, the
probability of transition of a trapped colloidal particle from the position x0 to x in lapse-time
τ is:

Note that λ can be written in terms of the diffusion coefficient as λ = κD/kB T by using eq.
(4) and (10a). For short values of the time-step, τ  1/λ, this distribution is identical to the
standard Gaussian propagator, (7). On the other hand, for long values of the temporal step, it
approximates to distribution of particle positions, (8). For intermediate times, the distribution
depends of a memory factor which appears in the initial position for every jump of the particle.
To obtain that memory factor, e−λτ , first we need to know the diffusion coefficient, D, which
is the quantity we want to estimate from the disk’s movement. It is important to observe that,
when τ  1/λ, we obtain α(t) = 2Dt. Eq. (10a) only differs from the standard MSD, eq. (6),
by a factor 2 in the spring constant (κ → κ/2). This will allow us to define a relaxed MSD
through the temporal jumps with memory effect, which we will identify with eq. (10a).

Results

We use the model previously explained, where the disk’s positions are obtained following the
overdamped Langevin equation, eq. (3), to analyze the diffusion of a trapped simulated disk,
always under standard experimental conditions, when we the increase the stiffness of applied
the restoring force. The input data are those of a typical experiment using commercial optical
tweezers: trapped particle of diameter d = 1.9 µm, at temperature T = 295.5 K, time-lapse
τ = 2.5 ms (400 images per second in the video-microscopy set-up), during a total time of 50
s. The internal time step in the simulations, dt, is fixed to dt = 10−4 s. The typical stiffnesses
of the traps are κ ∼ 0.02 − 2 µN/m. The surrounding fluid is water (η = 0.95 mPa.s) and
the bead is located far enough from the influence of nearby walls [3]. Using these experimental

Figure 2: Mean-squared displacements (MSDs) from two-dimensional Brownian dynamics simulations of disks under harmonic potentials. We plot standard MSDs (circles) according to eq.
(5) and relaxed MSDs (squares), eq. (11), for three different values of the input optical stiffness:

input values, we are in the intermediate situation of the Fokker-Planck solution described in the
former section. Indeed, 1/λ ∼ 9−840 ms is obtained in the interval of typical κ, not far from the
input time-step, τ = 2.5 ms. Here lies the importance of using experimental-like simulations,
since Brownian motion theoretical explanations depend on the time scale of observation. Under
this conditions, the theoretical diffusion coefficient is D = 0.239 µm2 /s according to eq. (4).
To have into account this effect, we develop an alternative iterative method to obtain the
diffusion coefficient. From a step n to a total number of steps N , we define a relaxed meansquared displacement, MSD∗ (t):
MSD∗ (t) ≡ ∆x2n,λ  ≡

2

where this MSD should verify eq. (10b). By using here that σκ2 ≡ kB T /κ, we can define a
function ξ(nτ ):


∆xn,λ )2 
ξ(nτ ) ≡ − log 1 −

(12)
σκ2
The function ξ(nτ ) grows linearly with time with slope 2λ, something which allows to obtain
λ from a linear regression. By calculating κ independently from the distribution ρκ (r) (8) (as
in Fig. 1) or by the plateau in the MSD, and applying an iterative method until obtaining a
stable λ value.
In Fig. 2, we show an example of one-dimensional standard MSD calculation, eq. (5) and
the relaxed MSD∗ defined by eq. (11), for several values of the input trap stiffness κo . Both
quantities have a similar behavior, displaying a plateau at higher times when reaching the
time-scale τk . However, the MSD∗ shows a correction on this plateau, which increases when
the restoring force is more intense. In the Inset of Fig. 2, the linear behavior of the defined
function ξ(t), eq. (12), can be seen, allowing to obtain λ and, consequently, D.
In Table 1, we show a complete set of the values for self-diffusion coefficients in the range
of the trap stiffnesses used in video-microscopy experiments. We summarize the values for

Table 1: Results from experiment-like Brownian dynamics simulations by increasing the input
trap stiffness κo . We show the obtained κ values, λ and, finally, the diffusion coefficients D∗
obtained from the iterative method. The table summarizes the results for D calculated used
the standard MSD and eq. (6). The averages provide D∗  = 0.241 ± 0.008 µm2 /s, and
D = 0.238 ± 0.007 µm2 /s, while the theoretical value is D = 0.239 µm2 /s.
the self-diffusion coefficients calculated using the standard MSD and eq. (6), D, and through
the iterative method, D∗ . The data shown is an average of the calculations for coordinates
x and y, which have been analyzed separately after simulations. We also show the κ values
obtained from the simulated data of the position of the disk to be compared with the input
data. This comparison between κo and κ allows to understand the reach of the experimental-like
simulations, which are statistically limited, as it should be when measuring with a standard
video-microscopy set-up. The coefficient of diffusion values do not depend on the κ value,
allowing to calculate an average value for D from the data of Table 1. The averages provide
D∗  = 0.241 ± 0.008 µm2 /s and D = 0.238 ± 0.007 µm2 /s. Both values nicely agree with the
theoretical value, with a relative error lower than 1%.

Conclusions

We have developed experiment-like Brownian dynamics simulations of two-dimensional disks
under harmonic potentials to evaluate the reach of experiments of microsphere diffusion with
optical tweezers, which are modeled as external Hookean forces. These type of computational
studies, based on emulating experimental set-ups, are quite useful to design time- and costefficient experimental procedures. After summarize the basic theory of Brownian motion applied
to the relevant time-scale, we observe that the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation to this
stochastic system allows us to modify the standard definition of the mean-square displacement
by including a memory term in the initial position of the disk’s jumps. Based on this relaxed
MSD, we propose an alternative method to obtain the self-diffusion coefficient. The values

calculated through that method are compared to the self-diffusion coefficients obtained using
the standard mean-square displacement. Under the experimental conditions, the averaged
values of the diffusion coefficients obtained from both methods return values which differ from
the theoretical less than 1%.
