Abstract. Cryptography technology for the security of the information has been
developing rapidly for the purpose of social, political, diplomatic, and military
purposes from the past. Especially, amid the information era, as the data communication and electronic commerce, people came to feel the necessity to develop the cryptography along with the increasing importance of the preservation
of information. One of the biggest characteristics of chaos theory is that it sensitive dependency of the initial condition which means that chaos generate a big
change in spite of a tiny change in the initial stage. The keystream generation
algorithm creates chaos signal using logistic difference equation, which is proposed by May, and then gets parts of signal from secret key of the external input. Finally, it creates transformed binary code from threshold and generations
keystream from combination binary code. This study suggests the keystream
generation algorithm for the stream cryptography using the logistic difference
equation and presents result of keystream analysis that can apply effectively to
the encryption which is nonlinear characteristics like chaos.

1 Introduction
The stream cryptography has a lot of merit than any other cryptography. First, no more
error will distribute to any other field. It is easy to implementation into hardware or
software. Instead of the communication delay, high-speed communication can be
possible. On the basis of the above merits, it is applicable to design the safest cryptography. It is difficult, however, to use in the private field, for the length of key is too
long.
Groth, Geffe, Siegenthaler and Rueppel make every effort to improve nonlinear
keystream by the nonlinear combination of the output sequence by LFSR. But, in the
nonlinear keystream using LFSR, if the output sequence by the LFSR has the correlation with nonlinear combiner function, the correlation can be the ground of correlation attack to easily seek keystream.

Chaos theory is characterized by the sensitive dependence in the initial conditions;
no periodic cycle and unpredictable attract. Thus, Chaos theory is very useful and
practical in stream cryptography using one Time Pad code.
This study suggests the algorithm of keysteram generation Logistic difference
equation based chaos theory. The preparation of manuscripts which are to be reproduced by photo-offset requires special care. Papers submitted in a technically unsuitable form will be returned for retyping, or canceled if the volume cannot otherwise be
finished on time.

2 Stream cryptosystem
The stream cryptosystem, as one of the secret key cryptosystem, never reveals the
algorithm consisting of keystream. Its another feature is non recycled and the separate
XOR by bit of keystream and plantext. According to the synchronous algorithm of
plantext and keystream, it is classified into the self-synchronous algorithm and the
synchronous algorithm.
The stream cryptosystem has more merit than any other cryptosystem. First, no
more error will be distributed to any other field. Various conditions related to security
level could be computed by the measurement of a fixed quantity in this system. It is
easy to implementation into hardware or software. Instead of the communication delay, high-speed communication can be possible. On the basis of the above merits, it is
applicable to design the safest cryptosystem. It is difficult, however, to use this system
in the private field, for the length of key is too long.
In the synchronous stream cryptosystem, periodic cycle in the process of coding is
decided by the periodic cycle of keystream. Therefore, the security level depends on
the generation of keystream resistant to different types of code invasion.
The keystream generated by using Linear Feedback Shift Register(LFSR) has the
periodic cycle of 2-1 by using LFSR on the step of n. It is said to be decoded by the
plantext attack using Berlekamp-massey algorithms. The possibility of this attack was
first suggested by Blaser and Heizmann, and proven by Siegenthaler. Thus, keystream
generator function used in Stream ecryption system is designed with nonlinear function which has no correlation in order to avoid the correlation attack.

3 Chaos Theory
Generally, it had been difficult to prove various natural phenomena scientifically.
Lolenz's study triggered the effort to seek for the regularity and order behind the
complication of nature. He found the chaostic system of "butterfly effect", namely
"sensitive dependence of initial condition". In 1975, according to York and Li,
"chaos" is defined as the complicated phenomenon of the determinable nonlinear
dynamic system. Rober May provided the ground of much applied field of chaos by
mathematically treating the change of the number of individual living things.

Chaos theory is generally referred to the irregular and complicated orbit in the determinable nonlinear dynamic system. The definition of "chaos" depends on researchers including Oono & Osikawa, Ott, Sustar and Debani. Ott found the practical way to
understand chaos, and explained that autocorrelation immune order is "zero" in increasing the delaying and has non periodic cycle.
Chaos theory shows that when the chaotic features such as the sensitiveness to the
initial condition, the unstable attract and one linear nature are used in the cryptosystem, it is believed that the cryptosystem becomes more effective.

4 Advanced Keystream generation algorithms

4.1 Suggests Keystream generation algorithms
This study suggests the algorithm of keystream generation as follows; generate of
initial condition for logistic difference equation by using the secret key from external
input.; First, generate the initial condition for Logistic difference equation; second,
generate the chaotic signal from by Logistic difference equation on initial condition
which is made first step; finally, seriously combine the signal by changing binary
condition of "0" or "1" with threshold. Consequently, the chaotic signal made from
Robert May's Logistic difference equation is changed into binary sequence code.
The given algorithm of keystream generation improves the randomness and non
periodic cycle generated by chaotic features, taking the signal condition when the
initial condition is changed in first generating the chaotic signal. In the process of
changing into binary code, threshold can be freely changed to individually generate
function or algorithms

4.2 Generation of Initial Condition
In order to generate the chaotic signal to make keystream, this study utilizes logistic
difference equation, the mathematical expression of the change of individual number,
which was explained by Robert May. Logistic difference equation is as follow:
Xn+1 =

Xn(1-Xn)

(1)

is the increase rate, Xn is the present number of individualities, Xn+1 is the next
number of them. In the above logistic difference equation , the change of Xn into
Xn+1 is referred to logistic map. When the individual number is small, the large condition of
means rapid increase and oppositely, the small condition does rapid decrease. the condition change depends on the condition of , the increase rate. When
the status of chaos is over =3.66, the chaos with irregular periodic cycle appears
until =4. In this study,
generated over 3.66 as under 4, keystream with the fea-

ture of irregular periodic cycle and nonlinear nature is expected to be generated by
using time series with the chaotic situation.
Given by the first condition, the chaos signal is determined by unique status space
so, the first signal showing variant type is a must for making use of the chaos signal
which is sensitive to the first condition.
Past research indicated that when cryptosystem was used, s fixed initial condition,
or only a small change of the initial condition was allowed.
In the paper, the initial condition that for the chaos signal generated by the secret
key. The chaos function's initial condition generated difference secret key is shown
below table 1.

can be freely selected.

The nonlinear function, which is used for generating nonlinear keystream by using
LFSR, means the combine function to combine keystream in the nonlinear way from

each LFSR. It examines the security of the combine function by evaluating the balance, nonlinear nature, correlation immunity, etc.
As Logistic difference equation is the nonlinear function showing the chaos under
the certain conditions, it is said that the keystream meets the conditions of non periodic cycle and nonlinear natureIf you wish to include color illustrations in the electronic version in place of or in addition to any black and white illustrations in the
printed version, please provide the volume editors with the appropriate files.
If you have supplementary material, e.g., executable files, video clips, or audio recordings, on your server, simply send the volume editors a short description of the
supplementary material and inform them of the URL at which it can be found. We
will add the description of the supplementary material in the online version of LNCS
and create a link to your server.

5.1 Balance Characteristic
The evaluation of the nonlinear nature can be equal to that of the balance, so it is important to evaluate the balance about the pattern of "0" and "1" on the generated
keystream.
The balance, as one of the major elements to evaluate the randomness, is whether
the number of "0" and "1" of keystream is in balance. Given the number of "0" included in the key is referred to n0 and that of "1" n1, the ideal example is n0=n1.
The results of the balance in the sample of 1,048,576 bitis as follows Table 3. Because, it is impossible to evaluate the total periodic cycle of the generated keystream.

6 Conclusion
The security for the electronic commerce generally relies on the authentication, digital
signature, electronic pay, and so forth, based on the cryptosystem.
Siegenthaler theoretically proved that nonlinear keystream using LFSR can be decoded by applying the correlation of the stream outputted by LFSR and nonlinear
combine function. Therefore, the function of keystream generation used in the stream
cryptosystem should be designed as the nonlinear function with no relation to avoid
correlation attack.
It is necessary to keep the security of keystream for the safe stream cryptosystem.
The chaos has the chaotic attract and unclear range to be predicted. It is very sensitive
to any little difference of the initial condition and impossible to be decoded by using
pattern. Since there are a lot of variables in generating chaos signal, it is difficult to
decode the keystream with non periodic cycle and nonlinear nature.
This study suggested the algorithm to generate the keystream by using the Logistic
difference equation based chaos theory and presents result of keystream analysis that
are balance characteristic, run time for keysteram generation.
It is expected that the keystream generation algorithm using the chaos theory can
be applied for key generation of electronic commerce and another cryptosystem
which will be developed in the future.
