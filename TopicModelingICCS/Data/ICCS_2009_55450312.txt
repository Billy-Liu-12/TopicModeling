Abstract. The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) system is
the Environmental Protection Agency’s main modeling tool for atmospheric pollution studies. CMAQ-ADJ, the adjoint model of CMAQ, offers new capabilities such as receptor-oriented sensitivity analysis and
chemical data assimilation. This paper presents the construction of discrete advection adjoints in CMAQ. The new adjoints are thoroughly validated against ﬁnite diﬀerences. We assess the performance of discrete
and continuous advection adjoints in CMAQ on sensitivity analysis and
4D-Var data assimilation applications. The results show that discrete
adjoint sensitivities better agree with ﬁnite diﬀerence value than their
continuous counterparts. However, continuous adjoints result in a faster
convergence of the numerical optimization in 4D-Var data assimilation.
Similar conclusions apply to modiﬁed discrete adjoints.

Introduction

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system is a powerful
third generation air quality modeling tool used to predict the state of the airborne pollutants [1]. CMAQ is capable of modeling important air quality issues
such as tropospheric ozone, ﬁne particles, acid deposition, and visibility degradation [2]. CMAQ is the Environmental Protection Agency’s main modeling tool
for assessing atmospheric pollution, and it is being widely used by the scientiﬁc
community for a variety of air quality studies.
Adjoint modeling is a powerful tool for computing the sensitivities of the
model output with respect to (thereafter, w.r.t.) a large number of model inputs. Adjoints are widely used in applications including sensitivity analysis, data
assimilation, parameter estimation, stability analysis, etc. [6]. There are two approaches to adjoint model development. In the continuous adjoint approach one
ﬁrst diﬀerentiates the underlying mathematical equations at an abstract level,
then discretizes the resulting adjoint equations. In the discrete adjoint approach
one ﬁrst discretizes the physical equations (using a suitable numerical method),
then diﬀerentiates the discrete algorithm. Discrete adjoints are popular since
they can be obtained by automatic diﬀerentiation [7]. The two approaches lead
to diﬀerent adjoint models.

Chemical Data Assimilation with CMAQ

CMAQ-ADJ is the adjoint model of the CMAQ modeling system, and has
been developed through a collaboration between Caltech, Virginia Tech, and
University of Houston [2,9,10]. The CMAQ adjoint system has the added capability of performing sensitivity analysis and 4D-Var data assimilation. The
current implementation of CMAQ-ADJ considers the advection, diﬀusion, emission, deposition, and gas-phase processes. The continuous adjoint approach is
used for advection processes, while the discrete adjoint approach is used for
other processes including chemistry process and diﬀusion process.
In this paper we present the construction and validation of two newly developed modules CMAQ-ADJ: one is a discrete advection adjoint process, and the
second is a modiﬁed discrete adjoint, where we remove the monotonic property
of the piecewise parabolic method (PPM) [8] used to discretize the horizontal
advection process. For the remainder of this paper, we refer to the ﬁrst one as
discrete adjoint version, to the latter one as modiﬁed discrete adjoint version,
and to the current CMAQ-ADJ advection as the continuous adjoint version.
Diﬀerences of three adjoint versions for sensitivity analysis and 4D-Var data
assimilation are illustrated as well.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the chemical transport
model CMAQ. Section 3 presents the construction of discrete and continuous
adjoints, as well as their validation. Applications to sensitivity analysis and 4DVar data assimilation are presented in sections 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6
provides a summary of the work presented in this paper.

Chemical Transport Model in CMAQ

Atmospheric Chemical Transport Models (CTMs) are used to capture the knowledge about the physical and chemical processes that govern the evolution of
airborne pollutant ﬁelds. They have the ability to predict the concentrations of
the airborne pollutants. Atmospheric CTMs solve the atmospheric mass balance
equation deﬁned as follows [2]:
1
∂Ci
= −u · ∇Ci + ∇ · (ρK∇Ci ) + Ri + Ei
∂t
ρ

(1)

where Ci is the concentration for species i, u is the wind ﬁelds, ρ is the air
density, K is the diﬀusivity tensor, Ri represents the chemical reaction rate
for species i and Ei represents emissions. From the above formula, we see that
CTMs model the following important processes: advection (−u · ∇Ci ), diﬀusion
ρ−1 ∇ · (ρK∇Ci ), chemistry (Ri ) and emission (Ei ). In addition to these four
parts, CMAQ also includes cloud process, plume-in-grid process and aerosol
process. Details of all the science processes can be found in [1,5].
To develop the continuous adjoint system of a CTM we ﬁrst derive its tangent linear model (TLM) by diﬀerentiation, then use Lagrange multipliers and
integration by parts to get the adjoint system. Details of deriving adjoint system
can be found in [3].

Adjoint Construction and Validation

The adjoint of a multi-physics forward CTM requires the construction of adjoints
for each of its science processes. As mentioned in the ﬁrst section, two approaches
can be used to develop adjoint model: continuous adjoint approach and discrete
adjoint approach.
In this paper we report on a new implementation of a discrete advection
adjoint process. Details on adjoint development for other processes can be found
in [2].
3.1

Vertical Advection

The vertical advection equation in CMAQ [2] is
∂(wρC)
∂(ρC)
=−
(2)
∂t
∂z
where C is concentration vector (a function of time and space), ρ is the air
density and w is the vertical wind ﬁeld.
Continuous Adjoint of Vertical Advection. The corresponding continuous adjoint
model of vertical advection [2] is
∂(wλ/ρ)
∂(λ/ρ)
=
∂t
∂z
where λ is the adjoint variable.

Discrete Adjoint of Vertical Advection. Discrete adjoint of vertical advection
is implemented from the forward code with the aid of automatic diﬀerential
tool such as TAMC (Tangent linear and Adjoint Model Compiler) [7]. For the
adjoint mode, we need checkpoints of the forward concentration state. Therefore, we write the concentration into checkpoint ﬁles after every dynamic time
step in forward mode and read them in the adjoint mode before every dynamic
time step.
Validation of Vertical Advection Adjoints. To validate the adjoints of vertical
advection, we compare the adjoint sensitivity with central ﬁnite diﬀerence sensitivity. Speciﬁcally, we choose a source layer (Ls = 7), a receptor layer (Lr = 10),
and a species (S = O3 , ozone). A perturbation of species S is introduced in
each grid of the source layer and is tracked at the corresponding grid (i.e., in
the same column) at the receptor layer. In other words, we compute dC(Lr , S)/
dC(Ls , S) (for the same column) using both central ﬁnite diﬀerence approach
and the adjoint sensitivity approach. Fig. 1(a) shows the scattered plot of continuous adjoint sensitivity vs. central ﬁnite diﬀerence values for 8 hours run of
CMAQ-ADJ with vertical advection only. Each point represents one sensitivity
(one column), with the x coordinate the value obtained by the adjoint method
and the y coordinate the value obtained by central diﬀerences. Fig. 1(b) shows a
similar scattered plot for discrete adjoint sensitivities. We see that discrete adjoint sensitivities of vertical advection agree better with ﬁnite diﬀerence results
than continuous adjoint sensitivities.

3.2

Horizontal Advection

In CMAQ horizontal advection is directionally split, with successive calls made
to x-axis advection and to y-axis advection. Since the same one-dimensional
advection algorithm is used for both x and y directions, we consider x-advection
in this section. The one-dimensional horizontal advection equation [2] is similar
to (2), with the horizontal wind ﬁeld u replacing w. If the total mass continuity
holds for the horizontal advection equation, its equivalent form is
∂(C)
∂(C)
= −u

(4)

Continuous Adjoint of Horizontal Advection. The corresponding continuous adjoint of horizontal advection takes the form (3) with λ the adjoint variable, ρ the
air density, and u (instead of w) the horizontal wind ﬁeld. The continuous adjoint
equation is implemented by calling the forward horizontal advection subroutine
with a reversed wind ﬁeld (−u).
Discrete Adjoint of Horizontal Advection. The same automatic-diﬀerentiation
based approach used to develop the discrete adjoint of vertical advection is employed to develop the discrete adjoint of horizontal advection.
Modified Discrete Adjoint of Horizontal Advection. In CMAQ the numerical
method used to solve the advection equation is the piecewise parabolic method
(PPM). PPM has monotonicity properties obtained with the help of slope and
curvature limiters. The reverse mode diﬀerentiation of these limiters may introduce discontinuities in the discrete adjoint solution [8].
In the modiﬁed discrete adjoint approach we remove monotonicity characteristics of the PPM by commenting out the steepening procedure (i.e., the limiters);

316

this non-monotonic code is then processed by automatic diﬀerentiation. The
algorithm is smooth and has no points of non-diﬀerentiability.
Validation of Horizontal Advection Adjoints. To validate adjoint of horizontal
advection, we plot the adjoint sensitivities and ﬁnite diﬀerence values . Specifically, we choose a source column (cs ), a receptor column (cr ), and a species
(S = O3 ). For a given vertical layer and all horizontal rows, the sensitivities dC(cr , S)/dC(cs , S) are computed using adjoints and using central ﬁnite
diﬀerences.
Fig. 2 presents the scattered plots of all three adjoint sensitivities against
the ﬁnite diﬀerence counterparts. An 8-hour horizontal advection experiment is
carried out. Each point represents a sensitivity pair at diﬀerent vertical layer
and horizontal row. The continuous adjoint results are shown in Fig. 2 (a), the
discrete adjoints in Fig. 2 (b), and the modiﬁed discrete adjoints in Fig. 2 (c)
shows the scatter plot of the modiﬁed discrete adjoint vs. ﬁnite diﬀerence results.
The continuous adjoint sensitivities show the highest discrepancies against the
ﬁnite diﬀerences. Both the discrete adjoint and the modiﬁed discrete adjoint
results show good agreement with ﬁnite diﬀerence results.

Sensitivity Analysis

Sensitivity analysis quantiﬁes changes in the model output w.r.t. the variations
in model inputs. The sensitivity (derivative) of the model output/receptor with
respect to model inputs/sources can be obtained by two approaches. One is the
forward approach where the perturbation of the input/source propagates forward in time to the output/receptor. The other one is adjoint approach where
the perturbation of the receptor is traced backward to the contributing sources.
Therefore the forward approach can eﬃciently compute the sensitivity of many
outputs/receptors w.r.t. a few sources. The adjoint approach can eﬃciently provide the sensitivities of a few outputs/receptors w.r.t. many inputs/sources.

With the development of CMAQ-ADJ, CMAQ is capable of performing adjoint sensitivity analysis. To see the diﬀerence of sensitivities provided by the
three diﬀerent versions of advection adjoint Fig. 3 presents the results of a 24
hours simulation. The model output is the sum of O3 concentrations in the area
described by grid cells (18 : 22, 18 : 22, 1 : 4), at 00:00:00 (GMT) hours on
July 3, 1999. The model inputs are initial N O2 conditions at 18:00:00 (GMT)
hours on July 2, 1999. Fig. 3 reveals small diﬀerences between the sensitivity
ﬁelds computed by the three adjoint versions. We next study how this diﬀerence
aﬀects the 4D-Var application.

4D-Var Data Assimilation

Data assimilation is the process of fusing information from model predictions and
observations in order to obtain better initial conditions, boundary conditions or
emission estimates. 4D-Var data assimilation optimally combines three sources
of information: a priori estimate of the state of the atmosphere; knowledge about
the physical and chemical processes that govern the evolution of pollutant ﬁelds
as captured in the model; and observations of some of the state variables [3].
We apply 4D-Var data assimilation with CMAQ-ADJ to provide optimal estimates of the initial conditions. 4D-Var data assimilation is posed as an optimization problem where the best estimate of initial conditions minimizes the
following cost function:
J(c0 ) =

1
2

N
k=1

1
(ck − ck,obs )T Rk−1 (ck − ck,obs ) + (c0 − cb )T B −1 (c0 − cb )
2

(5)

where c0 is the initial concentration, ck is the model prediction at time step k,
c(k,obs) is the observation at time step k, Rk is the observation error covariance
matrix, cb is the background concentration and B is the background error covariance matrix. The cost function measures the misﬁt between model predictions
and observations as well as the misﬁt between initial conditions and background
concentrations.
5.1

Implementation

To minimize the cost function (5), we apply L-BFGS, a limited memory quasiNewton method for solving large scale optimization problems [4]. L-BFGS is
an iterative method which requires, at each iteration step, the cost function
value and its gradient at that point, and returns another point which is a better
approximation to the optimal solution. The whole process continues until the
convergence criteria are satisﬁed.
In the implementation of CMAQ/4D-Var we interface L-BFGS with the CMAQADJ. The cost function value and gradient value are obtained through a forward
run followed by an adjoint run of CMAQ-ADJ.

4D-Var Results

To validate our CMAQ/4D-Var implementation we have designed a test case
as follows. First, we choose a reference initial concentration c0 and perform
a forward model run to lay down a set of synthetic observations. Second, a
perturbation is introduced to obtain cp = c0 + Δc0 . Third, cb = cp is used as the
background value and as the starting point for L-BFGS algorithm. After each
iteration run, we obtain a new initial point ck0 . Again, by performing a forward
run and a adjoint run, we obtain the cost function value and gradient at ck0 ,
which are used as the input for the next L-BFGS iteration. When convergence
occurs we get an optimal estimate ca0 to the reference initial condition c0 .

In the following section, we show the 4D-Var simulation results for three
diﬀerent versions of CMAQ-ADJ. In our experiment, we perturbed ozone and
retrieved ozone only. We visualize the diﬀerence between the initial guess and
the reference as well as the diﬀerence between the optimized solution and the
reference. In addition, we plot the log of the cost function values as the iteration
number increases. To see if the optimized solution converges to the reference, we
also plot the root-mean square (RMS) values given by: RMS= ck0 − c0 / c0 .
Fig.4 and Fig.5 show the 4D-Var validation results for a 12 hours simulation with all science processes for species O3 . With the continuous adjoint the
optimized initial condition agrees very well with the reference initial condition.
In addition, the cost function and RMS values decease signiﬁcantly with the
number of model runs indicating a fast convergence to the reference initial condition. On the other hand, the discrete adjoint shows slow convergence, and the
modiﬁed discrete adjoint does not achieve convergence.

Conclusion

In this paper we present the construction and validation of discrete and modiﬁed discrete advection adjoints in CMAQ. Discrete adjoint sensitivities given
by both approaches match the ﬁnite diﬀerence results better than continuous
adjoint sensitivities. However, in 4D-Var data assimilation experiments, a much
faster convergence is obtained when the gradients are computed using the continuous adjoint approach than using the discrete adjoint or modiﬁed adjoint
approaches. We believe that this eﬀect is related to the smoothness of the respective gradients. Accordingly, we conclude that, for CMAQ-ADJ, continuous
adjoint is preferable for 4D-Var data assimilation while discrete adjoint provide
better sensitivity agreement with ﬁnite diﬀerence results. Both continuous and
discrete adjoint implementations are available to the user in the new CMAQADJ version.
