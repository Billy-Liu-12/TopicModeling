Abstract
We developed the direct SAC-CI (symmetry-adapted cluster-configuration interaction) method for accurate calculations of
electronic excited states of large molecules. The direct SAC-CI method uses an efficient MO (molecular orbital) direct scheme
that is compatible with the perturbation-selection technique with using sparse linear algebra techniques. The direct SAC-CI can
calculate large molecules with moderate computational cost. Using the direct SAC-CI method, excited states of free-base
tetraazaporphyrin, phthalocyanine, naphthalocyanine, and anthracocyanine were studied. An interesting feature of the observed
spectra is that the splitting of the Q-bands decreases with increasing molecular size. The SAC-CI calculation well reproduced the
observed trend of excitation energies and showed the importance of electron correlation effects in the excited states.

1. Introduction
Electronic structure and electronic excitations of macrocyclic conjugated systems are being widely studied
because of their importance in material science and other fields. Porphyrins and phthalocyanines, which are
representative molecular species with conjugated heterocyclic macrocycles, are important chronophers; therefore,
their electronic excitations have been widely studied. In this study, we investigated the electronic excitations of
phthalocyanine and related compounds by quantum chemical calculations.
The characteristics of photoabsorption of porphyrins are as follows: 1) An intense band, called a B- or Sorel band
is observed usually around 3 eV of excitation energy. 2) Several, usually weak, absorptions arising from Q-bands
are observed in the energy region 1.8-2.5 eV. The fundamental interpretation of these absorption bands is based on
Gouterman’s four-orbital model [1,2], which explains the Q- and B-bands in terms of electron transitions between
the two HOMOs (highest occupied molecular orbitals) and two LUMOs (lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals).
The actual absorption energies and intensities of Q- and B-bands depend on chemical substitution and modifications
of porphyrin skeleton and coordination of metals. For tuning of optical characteristics of porphyrins, the simple
four-orbital model is insufficient and high-level ab initio calculations are strongly required.
The UV-vis spectra of tetraazaporphyrins (TAP) and phthalocyanine (Pc) have been studied by the symmetry1877–0509 © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. Open access under CC BY-NC-ND license.

adapted cluster (SAC) and the SAC-configuration interaction (SAC-CI) methods in 1996 and 1997 [3,4]. Those
studies proposed orbital pictures and mechanisms for the electron transitions; the origin of exceptionally strong Qbands of TAP and Pc was clarified by those SAC-CI studies.
Although theoretical calculations are helpful for understanding the electronic excitations of molecules, there are
limited high-level ab initio calculations available on the electronic excited states of Pcs and related compounds.
Those compounds are still large for excited state calculations with high-level ab initio methods. For studying
excited states of large conjugated macrocyclic systems, required theories have to be size-consistent and their
computational cost should be moderate. The SAC/SAC-CI method satisfies such requests; therefore, it is an
adequate method to study electronic excitations of large systems [5].
In this report, we show our recent development of the SAC-CI method for large systems and its applications to
the excited states of extended Pcs. The direct SAC-CI method combined the efficient molecular orbital (MO) direct
scheme and the perturbation-selection technique [6], which enable accurate calculations for large systems. Using the
direct SAC-CI method, we calculated the electronic excited states of a series of Pcs: free-base TAP (H2TAP), freebase Pc (H2Pc), free-base naphthalocyanine (H2Nc), and free-base anthracocyanine (H2Ac). The UV-vis absorption
spectra of these molecules were consistently assigned based on the SAC-CI calculations [7].
2. Theory
In the SAC-CI method, the excited-state wavefunction can be written as [8-11]

ΨSAC-CI = ∑ d K RK† ΨSAC ,

(1)

K

where RK† represents a symmetry-adapted excitation operator whose coefficient is d K . The SAC wavefunction for
the ground state is described by the cluster-expansion formalism,

(

)

ΨSAC = exp ∑ cI SI† Φ0 ,
I

(2)

for the closed-shell Hartree-Fock reference state Φ 0 with cluster operator S I† and its amplitude cI . The SAC and
SAC-CI coefficients are determined by solving the nonlinear SAC equations or SAC-CI secular equations; these
equations are solved iterative method. The SAC equations may be written as

Φ0 H − ESAC ΨSAC = 0 ,

(3)

Φ0 SL ( H − ESAC ) ΨSAC = 0 ,

(4)

and

where H is the Hamiltonian and ESAC is the SAC energy. The SAC-CI secular equations may be written as

Φ0 RL ( H − ESAC-CI ) ΨSAC-CI = 0 .

(5)

Using the labels of excitation operators, I, K, L, The SAC-CI equation can be written as the matrix form as

∑ ( H LK + U LK ) d K = ESAC-CI ∑ SLK d K .

For iterative methods, we need to construct so-called sigma-vector that is the product of the Hamiltonian matrix
H and the basis vector b. For k-th iteration it may be written as

σ ( k +1) = Hb( k ) .

(10)

The Hamiltonian matrix elements are calculated by the MO integrals and coupling constants. In the MO direct
algorithm, H is not explicitly constructed. The sigma-vector is directly calculated from the MO integrals and basis
vector. Because of the unlinked term U, the SAC and SAC-CI equations are rather complex than simple direct-CI
equations; therefore, we have to introduce several intermediate arrays for efficient calculations. However, they
basically result in the following vector-matrix product,

σ ( k +1) = Vb ( k ) ,

(11)

where V denotes a intermediate array that is stored in external storage.
For large-scale calculations, the SAC/SAC-CI method adopts the perturbation-selection technique: only
important operators [R and S in Eqs.(1) and (2)] are used for calculations. The operators are selected by the
perturbation theory [12]. For SAC the ground state, the doubly excitation operators S K† is included in practical
calculations if

Es ( S K† ) ≥ λg ,

(12)

where Es ( S K† ) is the second-order energy contribution of to the ground state energy,

Es ( S

Φ 0 S K H Φ 0 Φ 0 HS K† Φ 0
Φ 0 S K HS K† Φ 0 − Φ 0 H Φ 0

.

For excited states, the doubly excitation operators which satisfy

E p ( RK† ) ≥ λe ,

with

(15)

are includes in practical SAC-CI calculations. Here, ΨRef is the reference wavefunction whose energy is Eref. We
usually use CIS (configuration-interaction with single excitations) wavefunction.

If we use the perturbation-selection, the coefficient and sigma vectors in Eq. (4) become sparse vectors. The
essential point of the direct SAC-CI method is that the MO integral-direct scheme and the perturbation-selection
technique are combined with using sparse vector/matrix multiplication techniques [6]. The excitation operators for
singlet excited states are

R† = R1 + R1 = ∑ ∑ dia Ria † + 12 ∑ ∑ dijab Rijab † ,
i

a

ij ab

(16)

where, i, j, . . . and a, b, . . . denote occupied and unoccupied MOs, respectively. The perturbation-selection is
performed based on the excitation operator labels, I, K, L, while MO integral-direct scheme is formulated with using
the MO labels. Our direct SAC-CI method combined these operator label-based selection scheme and MO-based
direct sigma-vector scheme. We introduced new arrays that make correspondence between operator-labels and MOlabels. That can also work as indices of sparse vectors and matrices that stored in compressed form.
The formal computational cost of the direct SAC-CI is O(N2×M) for a system with N-active MOs and M-selected
operators; whereas, the cost without selection is O(N6). This sixth power of N dependence is a severe bottle-neck for
applying it to large-scale computations. The direct SAC-CI can reduce this cost and can be applied to electronic
excitations of large molecules.
3. Results
The direct SAC-CI method was applied for the calculations of the excited states of H2TAP (C16H10N8), H2Pc
(C32H18N8), H2Nc (C48H26N8), and H2Ac (C64H34N8); the molecules are shown in Figure 1. With using double-zeta
basis (D95), the largest system (H2Ac) contained 716 atomic orbitals (AOs), 644 active MOs; the number of
selected operators (the dimensions of the SAC/SAC-CI calculations) were about 2-5 million.

free-base anthracocyanine (H2Ac).

Table 1 shows the calculated and observed excitation energies of Q bands. An interesting feature of the observed
spectra is that the splitting of the Q-bands decreases with increasing molecular size [13]. The SAC-CI calculations
reproduced the observed low-energy shift (red shift) of Q bands and the decrease of the splitting of the Q-bands. The
CIS calculations could not reproduce this trend of Q-band splitting; therefore, the electron correlation is an essential
origin of this feature. The TDDFT calculations with standard functional such as TDB3LYP could not reproduce the
decrease of Q-band splitting.

Figure 2 shows the observed absorption spectra [13] and the SAC-CI results. In this figure, The D95(d,p) basis
was used for H2TAP. The polarization function improved the SAC-CI results but fundamental assignments of
excited state were possible by the calculations with D95 basis. The SAC-CI calculation reproduced weak absorption
of H2Ac between Q- and B-band around 2.5 eV. Corresponding states were calculated for H2Nc around 3.3 eV;
however, the peak was covered by strong B-bands and not observed by experiment.

4. Conclusion
The direct SAC-CI method uses an efficient MO integral-direct scheme that is compatible with the perturbationselection technique with using sparse linear algebra techniques. The direct SAC-CI method can accurately calculate
electronic excited states of large conjugated macrocyclic systems such as porphyrins and phthalocyanines. The
electronic excited states of H2TAP, H2Pc, H2Nc, and H2Ac were studied with using the direct SAC-CI method.

Because the SAC-CI method is size-consistent and considers the electron correlations in the ground and excited
states, the UV-vis spectra of these series of compounds were consistently assigned by the SAC-CI calculations. The
electron correlation was particularly important for the description of the two Q-band states.
