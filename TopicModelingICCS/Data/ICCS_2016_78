Abstract
In this paper, we develop a two-scale reduced model for simulating the Darcy ﬂow in twodimensional porous media with conductive fractures. We apply the approach motivated by the
embedded fracture model (EFM) to simulate the ﬂow on the coarse scale, and the eﬀect of
fractures on each coarse scale grid cell intersecting with fractures is represented by the discrete
fracture model (DFM) on the ﬁne scale. In the DFM used on the ﬁne scale, the matrix-fracture
system are resolved on unstructured grid which represents the fractures accurately, while in
the EFM used on the coarse scale, the ﬂux interaction between fractures and matrix are dealt
with as a source term, and the matrix-fracture system can be resolved on structured grid. The
Raviart-Thomas mixed ﬁnite element methods are used for the solution of the coupled ﬂows in
the matrix and the fractures on both ﬁne and coarse scales. Numerical results are presented
to demonstrate the eﬃciency of the proposed model for simulation of ﬂow in fractured porous
media.
Keywords: Fractured porous media, two-scale, discrete fracture model, embedded fracture model, mixed
ﬁnite element method.

Introduction

Modeling ﬂow in fractured porous media plays a signiﬁcant role in many applications such as
energy problems. The fractures representing strong heterogeneities are usually much permeable
than that in the surrounding matrix, and the width of fracture may be much smaller than any
reasonable mesh size for spatial discretization. One might utilize the single-domain model to
tackle the problem, however this needs to reﬁne the mesh locally around the fractures and

results in very expensive computations. Various models which include dual porosity model,
dual porosity dual permeability model, discrete fracture model (DFM) and some improvements
have been studied during the past several decades; see, e.g.,[1, 16, 2, 6, 14, 9, 10, 15, 8] and the
references therein.
In naturally fractured rock system with many fractures, a framework based on a number
of overlapping continua may be established, e.g., dual porosity, dual permeability models. In
order to obtain more accurate simulations, the DFM is proposed to deal with the fractures
as lower dimensional surfaces in the computational domain [14, 9, 10]. We point out that in
the DFM used in this paper, the interaction between the fractures and the surrounding matrix
is considered so that reﬁning locally around the fractures can be avoided. However, in this
approach, the grid should be generated according to the geometry and locations of fractures
such that the grid cell for fractures are located at the matrix cell interface. This can be done
by using complex unstructured grid generation strategy but leads to a large system. In order
to avoid generating complex conforming grid, one approach called the extended ﬁnite element
method (XFEM) was applied in [7, 5] by enriching the ﬁnite element basis on the elements
cut by the fractures with discontinuous functions, and the matrix grid and the fracture grid
can be non-matching at the intersection. Another approach, the concept of the embedded
fracture model (EFM) was introduced by Lee et al. [11, 12, 13]. In these works, the ﬂow
in fractured porous media is simulated by a hierarchical fracture modeling. The small scale
fractures are homogenized, while the long fractures are treated as low dimensional objects and
the ﬂux interaction between fractures and matrix are dealt with as a source term. The EFM
can avoid using complex grid for matrix-fracture system and may lead to a smaller system
compared with the DFM. Some extensions and applications of the EFM in the multiscale
approach were introduced in [8] for iterative multiscale ﬁnite volume method and in [4] for
generalized multiscale ﬁnite element method.
In this paper, a two-scale reduced model is devised which combines the concepts of DFM
and EFM. We assume that the permeability is homogeneous in the matrix. In the coarse scale,
we apply the EFM for simulating the ﬂow in fractured porous media to avoid using complex
grid on the whole domain. The ﬂux interaction between fractures and matrix is modeled in
a volume V intersecting with a fracture γ as a volume averaged source in matrix and a face
averaged source in fractures TVmf dx = ηKm (pγ − pm )/|V | and Tγf m = ηKm (pm − pγ )/|γ|,
where Km is permeability of the matrix, pm is the volume average of matrix pressure, pγ is
the face average of fracture pressure and η is a grid dependent parameter which is related
with the location of fracture in the volume V . In the literatures [11, 12, 13, 8], it is assumed
that the matrix pressure around a fracture is linearly distributed in a grid-block, then the grid
dependent parameter η deserves a detailed computation identity which will be discussed in the
following section. However, in most real problems this assumption is not usually satisﬁed, for
instance, the case when there are more than one fractures in the grid-block. Therefore, in
order to obtain a more accurate grid dependent parameter in the EFM, we apply the DFM
on ﬁne scale to resolve the parameter on each coarse scale grid cell intersecting with fractures
by oversampling technique in a larger sample domain which reduces the inﬂuence of setting of
boundary conditions. On the coarse scale for the EFM, we utilize the Raviart-Thomas mixed
ﬁnite element approximation of the lowest order (RT0 ), the next order of which (RT1 ) is used
for the DFM on the ﬁne scale.
The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we introduce some notations, the DFM
and the EFM for Darcy ﬂow in fractured porous media. The two-scale reduced model and the
associated Raviart-Thomas mixed ﬁnite element approximation is introduced in section 3. In
section 4, we present some numerical experiments for simulations of the two-scale model for

ﬂow in fractured porous media to verify the eﬃciency of the new model. Finally, the paper is
concluded in section 5.

Preliminaries

In this paper, we consider the simulation of single-phase Darcy ﬂow in the fractured porous
media. Let Ω ∈ R2 be a bounded and simply connected fractured porous media domain with
Lipschitz continuous boundary. When the inertial eﬀect is neglected, the single-phase ﬂow in
Ω governed by mass conservation and Darcy’s law can be written as:
∇·u=q
u = −K∇p

in Ω,
in Ω,

(2.1a)
(2.1b)

where p is the pressure, u is the Darcy velocity, K is a bounded symmetric and positive deﬁnite
permeability tensor, and q is the source term. We assume Dirichlet boundary condition and
Neumann boundary condition are both imposed on parts of ∂Ω. Since Ω is a fractured porous
media, K is a heterogeneous permeability tensor which has high values in fractures and low
values in matrix. To simulate (2.1) in the fractured porous media, we consider the DFM and
the EFM approaches in the following.

2.1

Discrete fracture model

In order to introduce the DFM for simplicity, we assume that there is a single fracture subdomain
in the porous media and the domain Ω is separated into three connected subdomains Ω1 , Ω2
and Ωf as shown in the left graph of Figure 1.

The matrix domain is denoted by Ωm = Ω1 ∪ Ω2 . The fracture domain Ωf is assumed as
d(s)
Ωf = {x ∈ Ω : x = s + tn, s ∈ γ and t ∈ (− d(s)
2 , 2 )}, where γ is a one-dimensional polygonal
line, n = n1 = −n2 is the unit normal vector to γ, ni |i=1,2 is the unit normal on ∂Ωi ∩ ∂Ωf
outwards with respect to Ωi , and d(s) denotes the thickness of fracture at the point s ∈ γ. Let τ
be the unit tangential vector to γ. The permeability tensors in matrix and fracture are denoted
by K m = Km I and K f = Kf I respectively, where Kf
Km > 0 and I is identity matrix. We
will use the reduced model proposed in [14] based on the DFM which couples the interaction
between the fractures and the surrounding matrix. We denote by ∇τ and ∇τ · the tangential
gradient and divergence operators along γ. Let ui , pi , qi be the restrictions of u, p, q in Ωi for
i = 1, 2, f . We denote by {·}γ the average of a quantity on γ such that {ψ}γ = 12 (ψ1 |γ + ψ2 |γ )
and · γ the jump of a quantity across γ such that ψ γ = ψ1 |γ − ψ2 |γ , where ψi |i=1,2 is a

function deﬁned in Ωi with well-deﬁned trace on γ. The reduced model for ﬂow within the
domain in the right graph of Figure 1 is written as (cf. [14]):

Actually, the equations (2.2c-2.2d) are obtained by averaging the conservation equation (2.1a)
and the Darcy’s law (2.1b) over cross-section of the fracture Ωf . The parameters in (2.2e) and
(2.2f) are deﬁned as ηγ−1 = d(s)Kf , ηγ = d(s)/Kf and ξγ = 2ξ−1
4 , ξ > 1/2. The above matrixfracture reduced system can be solved combining Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions.
Since the fractures are more permeable than that in the surrounding matrix, the Neumann
boundary condition on ∂γ N , which is immersed in the porous media, can be considered as
uγ · τ |∂γ N = 0. The above reduced DFM (2.2) can be extended to the problem with more
reduced non-intersecting fractures which are non-immersed, partially immersed or totally immersed in the porous media. For the problem with intersecting fractures, besides the interface
conditions across the fractures mentioned in (2.2), the reduced model should also be coupled
with additional coupling conditions at the intersection points for the fracture-fracture system
[7, 5].

2.2

Embedded fracture model

In order to avoid using the complex conforming grid for the reduced DFM, the EFM (cf.
[11, 12, 13]) was introduced by treating the long fractures as low dimensional objects and the
ﬂux interaction between fractures and matrix as a source term. Actually, the EFM can also be
applied for shorter fractures. For the EFM simulating the ﬂow in the matrix-fracture system
as in Figure 2, we consider the governing equations in the matrix
∇ · um = T mf + qm
um = −K m ∇pm

where T mf and T f m are the ﬂux interactions between fractures and matrix. The governing
equations used in fracture network in [11, 12, 13] are the same as that in the non-reduced
fractures. Here, we use the similar reduced equations in the fracture network as in the DFM.
1327

Figure 2: Two-dimensional matrix Ωm with one-dimensional fracture network γ.
By the fact that the total ﬂux balance between fractures and matrix should be guarantied
in a volume V , we have V T mf dx + γv T f m ds = 0, where γv is the reduced fracture network
containing in the volume V . When there is a single fracture γv in a volume V , the ﬂux interaction
can be modeled (cf. [13, 8]) as the face averaged source Tγfvm = ηKm (pm − pγv )/|γv | in the
discrete conservation law in the fracture and the volume averaged source TVmf = ηKm (pγv −
pm )/|V | in the discrete conservation law in the matrix. Here Tγmf
and TVmf are face average
v
and volume average of the ﬂux interaction T mf . From the viewpoint of DFM, one can easily
see that
T f m ds =
um · n γv ds = Km
∇pm · n γv ds.

When the matrix pressure around a fracture is assumed to be linearly distributed in the volume
V , e.g., pm |γv = 0, |∇pm | = 1, ∇pm ⊥γv and pm ≥ 0, then one can get pm = dγv (x) where
dγv (x) is the distance between a node x ∈ V and γv . When Kf is large enough, one can
assume pγv = 0 in this case and derive the identity for the grid dependent parameter as
η = 2|γv |/ dγv ,

(2.4)

where dγv = V dγv (x)dx/|V |.
The assumption of linear distributed matrix pressure around a fracture is usually used in
the EFM [13, 8]). However, this assumption does not always hold true, i.e., the identity (2.4)
for η is not always exactly satisﬁed. Therefore, in the next section we will consider two-scale
model and compute more accurate estimate for the grid dependent parameter on the ﬁne scale.

The two-scale model and mixed ﬁnite element approximation

In this section we consider a two-scale reduced model for simulating the ﬂow in fractured
porous media. In the following, we always assume the whole fractured porous media is a
two-dimensional rectangular domain. On the coarse scale, we utilize the EFM based on the
structured grid. As discussed in section 2.2, the grid dependent parameter relation (2.4) is not
always exactly satisﬁed in a volume. We will consider oversampling technique and solve the
local problems based on the DFM on a ﬁne scale grid to recover this parameter on each fracture
in a coarse scale grid cell.
Figure 3 shows the cases that the fractures non-immersed or partially immersed in the coarse
scale grid cell Tc . There may be more complex fracture system in a coarse scale grid cell. If
some parts of fractures locate at the face of coarse scale grid cells, the union of which will
be used to compute the grid dependent parameter. The fracture in Tc is extended artiﬁcially

correspondingly determined. Since the pressure changes slightly inside highly conductive fractures, the deﬁnition of α in (3.1) makes sense and will be used in the following as the grid
dependent parameter.
One can refer to [14] for the weak formulation of (2.2) and the associated well-posedness
property. We introduce the well-known Raviart-Thomas mixed ﬁnite element space of order k
2
as: RTk = [Pk ] ⊕ xPk , where Pk is the polynomial space of degree k ≥ 0. In the numerical
experiments, we use the RT1 space for velocity and piecewise P1 space for pressure to solve (2.2).
The ﬁne scale grid used for the solution of (2.2) is conforming, unstructured and matched at
the lower dimensional fractures. We can get the estimates for the grid dependent parameter α
according to (3.1) after the numerical solution of (2.2) in the extended matrix-fracture system.
Now we consider the numerical solution of (2.3) on the coarse scale grid. We denote by

for the fracture pressure at the intersection points of fractures. For simplicity, we assume

Numerical experiments

In this section, we will present several numerical experiments to show the eﬃciency of the
two-scale reduced model for Darcy ﬂow in fractured porous media. We assume the thickness
of fracture is always 0.01 in the experiments. When the reduced DFM (2.2) is applied, the
parameter ξγ in (2.2e) is chosen as ξγ = 1/8. The source terms qm and qγ in (2.2) and (2.3)
are both set to be zeros in the following experiments.
The ﬂux interaction identity (3.1) is used in the EFM in highly conductive fractures. Firstly,
we show the relationship between the grid dependent parameter α in (3.1) and Kf /Km when

the position of a single fracture in a grid cell is ﬁxed. As shown in left graph of Figure 4, we
consider a single fracture in a unit square domain Ωc = [0, 1] × [0, 1]. The two ends of the
fracture are set to be P0 = (0.2, 0) and P1 = (0.8, 1). The reference domain Ωc is extended to
a larger domain ΩE = [−1, 2] × [−1, 2], and the fracture is also extended to be non-immersed
in ΩE . We denote by αL the grid dependent parameter α obtained based on linear boundary
condition, and αO the grid dependent parameter α obtained by oversampling technique based
on the DFM in domain ΩE . From the right graph of Figure 4, we can see that both αL and
αO are almost a ﬁxed constant when Kf /Km is large enough. For other cases of single fracture
in Ωc , the same property can also be observed. Generally, one can compute a series of α based
on a sample of diﬀerent locations of fractures in Ωc , and obtain the approximate α for other
location of fracture by interpolation technique.

Two examples based on the two-scale reduce model in the matrix domain Ωm = [0, 20]2
are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. The permeabilities in matrix and fractures are assumed
to be Km = 1 and Kf = 106 for both two examples. In Figure 6, we test the case with
Dirichlet boundary condition pm = 1 at x = 0 and pm = 0 at x = 20, and no ﬂow condition
at y = 0 and y = 20, while in Figure 7, we test the case with Dirichlet boundary condition
pm = 1 at {(x, y) : x = 0, y ∈ [10, 20]} ∪ {(x, y) : x ∈ [0, 10], y = 20}, pm = 0 at {(x, y) : x =
20, y ∈ [0, 10]} ∪ {(x, y) : x ∈ [10, 20], y = 0} and no ﬂow condition at the other parts of ∂Ωm .
From Figures 6-7, we can observe how the fractures inﬂuence the global pressure distribution
in matrix and how the fractures collect the ﬂow from the matrix.

Conclusion

The DFM and EFM, in which the fractures are dealt as a lower dimensional problems, are used
in this paper to design a two-scale reduced model. The EFM is used as a coarse scale model,
while the DFM is applied on the ﬁne scale to compute an important grid dependent parameter
used in the EFM. The Raviart-Thomas mixed ﬁnite element methods are utilized for the DFM
on ﬁne scale and the EFM on the coarse scale. The eﬃciency of the grid dependent parameter
obtained by the DFM is tested. We compute two benchmark examples for the Darcy ﬂow in
fractured porous media, and make observation of the eﬀects caused by the fractures. Future
works of interest include the extension of the proposed model for the ﬂow in the fractured
porous media with anisotropic permeability in matrix and the simulation in three-dimensional
fractured porous media.
