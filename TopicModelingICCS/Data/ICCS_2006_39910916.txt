Abstract. In this paper we study the Lebesgue Δ-measure on time
scales. We refer to [3, 4] for the main notions and facts from the general
measure and Lebesgue Δ integral theory. The objective of this paper
is to show how the main concepts of Mathematica can be applied to
fundamentals of Lebesgue Δ- and Lebesgue ∇- measure on an arbitrary
time scale and also on a discrete time scale whose rule is given by the
reader. As the time scale theory is investigated in two parts, by means
of σ and ρ operators, we named the measures on time scales by the
set function DMeasure and NMeasure respectively for arbitrary time
scales.

Introduction

Time Scales works can be found in [1, 2,5]. The software Mathematica is one
of the most powerful tool in discrete and continuous analysis. Computational
works on time scale calculus are collected in TimeScale package [6]. As probability theory is established on continuous and discrete analysis, we generalize
TimeScale package in order to calculate the measure on time scales as a ﬁrst
step of probability theory and statistics.
In this paper ﬁrst we give an introduction to the time scales, and we present
the connection of the Lebesgue measure with the Lebesgue Δ-measure on an
arbitrary bounded time scale T such that min T = a and max T = b. We set out
many basic concepts from measure theory to the Δ-measurable space. Finally
we use Mathematica to illustrate the Lebesgue Δ- and ∇- measures to set out
the diﬀerences between Lebesgue measure and Lebesgue Δ (∇)- measure.

Δ- and ∇- Measure on Time Scale

Let T be a time scale, a < b be points in T, and [a, b) be half closed bounded
interval in T, σ and ρ be the forward and backward jump operators respectively
on T. Let
T : a , b ∈ T, a ≤ b }
1 = {[a , b )
be the family of all left closed and right open intervals of T. Then 1 is a semiring. Here [a , a ) = Ø. m1 : 1 → [0, ∞] is a set function which assigns to
each interval its length: m1 ([a , b )) = b − a . So if {In } is a sequence of disjoint
intervals in 1 then m1 ( In ) = m1 (In ).

Let E ⊂ T. By Carath´eodory extension, outer measure of E is

where In ∈

1.

If there is no such covering of E, then m∗1 (E) = ∞.

Deﬁnition 1. A set E ⊂ T is said to be Δ- measurable if for each set A
m∗1 (A) = m∗1 (A ∩ E) + m∗1 (A

Ec)

where E c = T − E. If E is Δ-measurable then E c is also Δ-measurable. Clearly
Ø and T are Δ- measurable.
Let M(m∗1 ) = {E ⊂ T : E is Δ measurable} be a family of Δ- measurable sets.
Corollary 1. M(m∗1 ) is a σ algebra.
Deﬁnition 2. The restriction of m∗1 to M(m∗1 ) is called Lebesgue Δ- measure
and denoted by μΔ .
So m∗1 (E) = μΔ (E) if E ∈ M(m∗1 ).
Similarly, if we take F2 = {(a , b ] : a , b ∈ T, a ≤ b } where (a , a ] is understood as an empty set then m2 : F2 → [0, ∞] such that m2 ((a , b ]) = b − a is a
countably additive measure. Then M(m∗2 ) is the set of ∇- measurable sets and
μ∇ is Lebesgue ∇- measure on T.
Proposition 1. Let {En } be an inﬁnite decreasing sequence of Δ- measurable
sets, that is, a sequence E1 ⊃ E2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ En ⊃ · · · , Ei ∈ F1 for each i, ∩Ei ∈ F1
and m∗1 (E1 ) < ∞. Then
m∗1 (

∇ and Δ Measures with Mathematica

Theorem 1. For each t0 ∈ T − {min T} the ∇- measure of the single point set
{t0 } is given by μ∇ ({t0 }) = t0 − ρ(t0 ).
Proof. Case 1. Let t0 be left scattered. Then {t0 } = (ρ(t0 ), t0 ] ∈ F2 . So {t0 } is
∇ measurable and μ∇ ({t0 }) = t0 − ρ(t0 ).
Case 2. Let t0 be left dense. Then there exists an increasing sequence {tk } of
points of T such that tk ≤ t0 and tk ↑ t0 . Since {t0 } =

∞

(tk , t0 ] ∈ F2 . Therefore

k=1

{t0 } is ∇ measurable. By continuity
∞

μ∇ ({t0 }) = μ∇ (
k=1

(tk , t0 ]) = lim μ∇ ((tn , tn ]) = lim t0 − tn = 0
n→∞

which is the desired result since t0 is left dense.

Theorem 2. If a, b ∈ T and a ≤ b then 1)μ∇ ((a, b]) = b − a, 2)μ∇ ((a, b)) =
ρ(b) − a, 3) If a, b ∈ T − min T then μ∇ ([a, b)) = ρ(b) − ρ(a) and μ∇ ([a, b]) =
b − ρ(a).
Proof. From the deﬁnition μ∇ ((a, b]) = b − a.
{b}) = μ∇ ((a, b)) + μ∇ ({b}) = μ∇ ((a, b)) + b − ρ(b)

μ∇ ((a, b]) = μ∇ ((a, b)

b − a = μ∇ ((a, b)) + b − ρ(b)
So μ∇ ((a, b)) = ρ(b) − a.
iii) Let a, b ∈ T − min T.
μ∇ ([a, b)) = μ∇ ({a}

(a, b)) = μ∇ ({a}) + μ∇ ((a, b)) = a − ρ(a) + ρ(b) − a = ρ(b) − ρ(a)

μ∇ ([a, b]) = μ∇ ([a, b)

{b}) = μ∇ ([a, b)) + μ∇ ({b}) = ρ(b) − ρ(a) + b − ρ(b) = b − ρ(a)

Theorem 3. For each t0 ∈ T − {max T} the single point set {t0 } is Δ- measurable and its Δ- measure is given by μΔ ({t0 }) = σ(t0 ) − t0 .
Proof. Case 1. Let t0 be right scattered. Then {t0 } = [t0 , σ(t0 )) ∈ F1 . So {t0 }
is Δ- measurable and μΔ ({t0 }) = σ(t0 ) − t0 .
Case 2. Let t0 be right dense. Then there exists a decreasing sequence {tk } of
points of T such that t0 ≤ tk and tk ↓ t0 . Since {t0 } =
{t0 } is Δ- measurable. By proposition 1

∞

[t0 , tk ) ∈ F1 . Therefore

k=1

∞

μΔ ({t0 }) = μΔ (
k=1

[t0 , tk )) = lim μΔ ([t0 , tn )) = lim tn − t0 = 0
n→∞

n→∞

which is the desired result since t0 is right dense.
Every kind of interval can be obtained from an interval of the form [a, b) by
adding or subtracting the end points a and b. Then each interval of T is Δmeasurable.
Theorem 4. If a, b ∈ T and a ≤ b then
1)μΔ ([a, b)) = b − a, 2)μΔ ((a, b)) = b − σ(a), 3) If a, b ∈ T − max T then
μΔ ((a, b]) = σ(b) − σ(a) and μΔ ([a, b]) = σ(b) − a.
To illustrate these properties with mathematica, our TimeScale package must
be loaded.
In[1]:= << TimeScale‘
Let the time scale is as follows
In[2]:= T = {5 <= x <= 7||x == 15/2||9 <= x <= 11||x == 12||x == 18}
We must deﬁne set function with respect to the interval or a single point
In[3]:= ClosedSet={ closed,a,b,closed }; OpenSet={ open,a,b,open };

LSemiClosedSet = { open,a,b,closed };
Spoint={ closed,a,closed };
DMeasure[ClosedSet[a−,b− ]]:=sigma[b]-a;
NMeasure[OpenSet[a−,b− ]]:=b-sigma[a];
DMeasure[LSemiClosedSet[a−,b− ]]:=b-a;
DMeasure[RSemiClosedSet[a−,b− ]]:=sigma[b]-sigma[a];
DMeasure[Spoint[a− ]]:=sigma[a]-a;
Now, we would like to ﬁnd the measures of {5} and (5, 11] In[4]:= DMeasure[Spoint[7]]
Out[4]:= 12
In[5]:= DMeasure[RSemiClosedSet[5,11]]
Out[6]:=7
Mathematica applications of ∇-measure also can be done as Δ-measure. The
sigma operator must be replaced by the r operator also.

Conclusion

In this work we worked on Lebesgue Δ-measure and Lebesgue ∇-measure on
time scales with Mathematica. We investigated each of these two measures in two
parts, arbitrary time scales and discrete time scales. To do these we improved the
TimeScale package. In the future, we will work on generalizing the probability
theory on Time Scales with Mathematica.
