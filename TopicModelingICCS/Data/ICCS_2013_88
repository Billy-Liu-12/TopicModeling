Abstract
Steady convection-diﬀusion equation in 2-D domain is considered. Central ﬁnite-diﬀerence approximation has been taken to
obtain a large sparse nonsymmetric linear system with positive real matrix. New class of product triangular skew-symmetric
iterative methods for solution of such system is presented and considered. Using this method as preconditioner for GMRES
and BiCG has been made. Results of numerical experiments for two-dimensional convection-diﬀusion equation for diﬀerent
big Peclet numbers and velocity coeﬃcients have been presented.

1. Introduction
Mathematical modeling of convection-diﬀusion problems is the most widespread in the science and engineering. Very often the dimensionless parameter that measures the relative strength of the diﬀusion is quite small, so
one often meets with situations where boundary and interior layers are present and singular perturbation problems
arise [14]. The small parameter at the higher derivatives is necessary but not a suﬃcient condition to appear of
boundary layer [12]. It is necessary to add property that boundary conditions and right-hand side of equation don’t
conform to each other. In such circumstances diﬃculties will be experienced with standard numerical approximation. It is also due to the fact that numerical algorithms and the techniques used for their analysis tend to be very
diﬀerent in the two limiting cases of elliptic and hyperbolic equations.
The choice of the discretization method is very important question for the partial diﬀerential equation with
ﬁrst order derivatives and the most interesting moment of the solution the problem. It is well known [17, 14] that
in general linear equation systems with M-matrix [16] can be obtained by application of upwind schemes while
positive real matrix can be obtained by using central FD schemes [10]. Each one of these schemes has their own
advantages and deﬁciencies which have been discussed in [18, 14].

It is well known [7], when convection-diﬀusion problems with boundary or interior layers are discretized
using the central diﬀerence method or the ﬁnite element method in classical formulation, the numerical solution
is polluted with oscillations because the corresponding diﬀerence operator is, in general, not monotone. An
alternative approach is to approximate the ﬁrst derivatives using some upwind technique or artiﬁcial diﬀusion [14,
18, 8]. One then obtains a monotone operator and oscillations free numerically computed solution but with lower
accuracy of the approximation scheme and smearing of the boundary layers.
Convection-diﬀusion equation is a good test for iterative methods. A lot of papers [3, 6, 11, 13, 18] described
numerical experiments with convection-diﬀusion equation for diﬀerent parameters.
Consider the convection-diﬀusion equation in bounded domain Ω writing in diﬀerent forms:

or

LNC u = −Pe−1 L2 u + L1ND u + L0 u − F,
∂u

L1 u = K1

where

is boundary condition and

Kαβ = Kαβ (x, y),

L0 u = K0 u, K0 = K0 (x, y) ≥ 0,
u = u(x, y), F = F(x, y), (x, y) ∈ Ω = [0, 1] × [0, 1]

are common coeﬃcients for (1), (2), Pe is the Peclet number, K = {K1 , K2 } is the velocity vector, F is right-hand
side, u is the solution and u |b is a function deﬁned on the domain boundary.
Convective terms in (1) are written in nonconservative form, whereas (2) contain them in conservative form.
One can rewrite (1) and (2) as follows:
Lu = −Pe−1 L2 u + L1S u + LN0 u − F,

(4)

where σ = −1 for equation (1) and σ = 1 for equation (2).
When the medium is incompressible, i.e. the condition
divK = 0

(5)

holds, then forms (1) and (2) are equivalent and the convection-diﬀusion equation can be written in the so-called
”symmetric” form [10, 13].

Additionally assume that condition of ellipticity for coeﬃcients from (3) is fulﬁlled [14].

2. Finite diﬀerence approximation of the equation and system of linear algebraic equation
The uniform grid Ωh with step h x = hy = h in domain Ω has been introduced. The boundary conditions on
∂Ω are interpolated on the boundary ∂Ωh with a second order truncation error. Coeﬃcients of diﬀerence scheme
include the quantity
S S C = Peh/2
(7)
which was called the skew-symmetry coeﬃcient of the problem.
Using natural ordering of unknowns, transform diﬀerence scheme to the nonsymmetric nine-diagonals linear
system of equations
Au = f,
1
A = AΔ + A1 + D, A0 = (A + A∗ ) = AΔ + D = A∗0 ,
2
1
A1 = (A − A∗ ) = −A∗1 ,
2

(8)

where A is (N − 1) × (N − 1) matrix, N = 1/h, u = {u11 , u12 , ..., uN−1N−1 }T is the vector of solution, f =
{ f11 , f12 , ..., fN−1N−1 }T is the vector of the right part. Operator A can be naturally expressed [10] in the case of
central diﬀerence approximation of the convective terms in (4) as a sum of symmetric positive deﬁnite operator
AΔ , skew-symmetric operator A1 and diagonal operator D. AΔ is a diﬀerence analogue L2h of operator L2 , describing a diﬀusion process, D is discrete analogue of sources and drains terms in the equation (4), described
by operator K0 and artiﬁcial term 1/2σ(divK). A1 is a diﬀerence analogue of the convective terms. Thus, linear
system (8) with non-symmetric matrix A is constructed.
If in (8) A0 is a positive deﬁnite matrix, then matrix A is called positive real. The linear system (8) is called
strongly non-symmetric if
A0 / A1 ∼ O(1),
where ∗ is one of matrix norms.
3. Iterative solution
Diﬀerent basic iterative methods such as ILU [15], SOR [17] and ADI [3] have been used directly for solution
of arising linear equation systems as well as preconditioners for CG or BiCG type’s methods [15]. As it was
shown in [1], ILU as preconditioner for GMRES(20) and Bi-CGSTAB has been broken for large S S C from (7)
and natural ordering of unknowns. ADI [3] and block SOR [4] have been quite successful for the case when Rh is
near unity.
We present new type of two parameters product triangular (PTM) iterative methods that use the skew-symmetric
part of the matrix as an input and only require the matrix to be positive real. Using this class of iterative methods
as preconditioners for GMRES(m) and BiCG are considered.
Some ideas using symmetric – skew-symmetric splitting of the matrix to solve linear equation systems have
been ﬁrstly proposed in [9], but idea to split of skew-symmetric part of an initial matrix has been proposed ﬁrstly
in [10].
Let us approach (8) by considering the iterative method of the following form:
yn+1 − yn
(9)
+ Ayn = f, n ≥ 0
τ
where f, y0 ∈ H, H is an n-dimensional real Hilbert space, f is the right part of (8), A, B(ω) are linear operators
(matrices) in H, A is given by equation (8), B(ω) is invertible, y0 is an initial guess, yk is the k-th approach, τ, ω > 0
are iterative parameters, u is the solution that we obtain, ek = yk − u and rk = Aek denote the error and the residual
in the k-th iteration, respectively.
Method (9) may be also represented as
yn+1 = Gyn + τ f,
B(ω)

G = B−1 (ω)(B(ω) − τA).

(10)

Consider choice of operator B for PTM
B(ω) = (BC + ωKU )BC−1 (BC + ωKL ),

BC = BC∗

(11)

where KL + KU = A1 , KL = −KU∗ , BC = BC∗ . Operators KL and KU represent strictly upper and lower triangular
part of a skew-symmetric matrix A1 from (8) and operator BC can be chosen arbitrarily, but has to be symmetric.
Choice B as in (11) was for the ﬁrst time introduced for ω = τ in [2]. Suﬃcient condition of convergence for PTM
has been proved in [12].
As a matter of fact, many widespread preconditioners are very symmetric by nature, whereas frequently it
does not need to improve ”features” of symmetric part and the main source of diﬃculties is concealed in large
and/or poor-conditioned nonsymmetric part.
Generally speaking, we show that the proposed technique is primary destined for strongly nonsymmetric
systems, and probably, especially for ones whose symmetric part is well-conditioned and does not require preconditioning.
4. PTM as preconditioner for GMRES(10) and BiCG
Equation (1) is discretized by centered diﬀerences for both the Laplacian and the ﬁrst derivatives on a uniform
grid with 31 × 31 interior nodes. Linear systems arising from the standard 5-point FD approximation of the steady
convection-diﬀusion problem of the form (1) with
K12 = K21 = 0

(12)

where F is chosen so that the solution of (1) is deﬁned as
u˜ (x, y) = e xy sin πx sin πy
is considered.
As one can easily verify, while discretization in (1), convective terms contribute to matrix A exactly its skewsymmetric part A1 .
The used velocity coeﬃcients of (1) are presented in the Table 1.

We set Pe = 103 , 104 and 105 in numerical tests. As one can see, for each model problem they are chosen to
satisfy the constraint div(v) = v1 x + v2y = 0 (which follows from the medium incompressibility for the problem
(1)). On the whole, in order to the test results be comparable with those obtained in the other adjacent papers we
take the analytical solution and the velocity coeﬃcients similar to those in [5].
The initial guess in all runs was a zero vector and iterations were performed until
rm / r0 ≤ 10−6 ,

(13)

where rm is the residual vector, and
represents the Euclidean norm.
For each test the number of iterations needed to satisfy (13) is presented in the tables.
Variants of PTM named PTMBc(1) and PTMBc(3) determinate [11] special choice of matrix BC and iterative
parameter τ.

5. Conclusions
For iterative solution processes of linear systems with strongly nonsymmetric matrices we propose simplenatured preconditioning technique which explicitly involves the skew-symmetric part of the matrix.
For a series of important applications the matrix skew-symmetric part may be get obtainable readily. For
example, this is the case when, in FD-FE models, the central diﬀerences (the conventional Galerkin elements) has
been used for approximate the ﬁrst derivatives. Nevertheless in many cases obtaining of skew-symmetric part is
not easy, and it might be a problem with applying the proposed technique.
The preconditioners under considerations are in a certain sense related with the standard ILU- and SSORpreconditioners, but they don’t require a diagonal dominant and use only skew-symmetric part of the initial matrix.
It is well done for strongly nonsymmetric linear equation system.
It should be pointed out that since PTM-technique relates to alternatively triangular class of two-level stationary iterative schemes it admits aﬀordable parallel and pipeline implementations. Numerical experiments have
shown that PTM is good preconditioner for GMRES and not bad preconditioner for BiCG for Problems 3 and 4.
So, it is possible to recommend PTM as preconditioner for GMRES and BiCG methods.
