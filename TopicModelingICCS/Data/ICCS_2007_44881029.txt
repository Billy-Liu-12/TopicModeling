Abstract. There are many results in one dimensional wavelet frame theory in recent years. However, since there are some essential diﬀerences in
high dimensional cases, the classical methods for one dimensional regular
wavelet frames are unsuitable for the cases. In this paper, under some
conditions on matrix-dilated sequences, a characterization formula for
irregular tight frames of matrix-dilated wavelets is developed. It is based
on the regular formulation by Chui, Czaja, Maggioni, Weiss, and on the
recent multivariate results by Yang and Zhou.
Keywords: Irregular frame, Tight wavelet frame, Matrix dilations,
Bessel sequences.

Characterization on Irregular Tight Wavelet Frames
with Matrix-Dilations

Assume ψ, ψ˜ ∈ L2 (Rn ), {Aj }j∈Z is a real n × n matrix sequence, B is a real
n × n nonsingular matrix. A−∗ is the transpose of A−1 . Let
Ψ = {ψj,k : j ∈ Z, k ∈ Zn }, Ψ˜ = {ψ˜j,k : j ∈ Z, k ∈ Zn },

where ψj,k (x) = |det Aj | 2 ψ(A−∗
j x − Bk). If {ψj,k : j ∈ Z, k ∈ Z } is a tight
frame for L2 (Rn ), then ψ is called a tight frame function with respect to dilation
sequence {Aj }j∈Z . There are some results in high dimensional wavelet frame
ψ˜j,k , g ,
theory in recent years (see [1] -[7] ). Let P (f, g) =
n f, ψj,k
j∈Z,k∈Z

f, g ∈ L2 (Rn ). Now we consider the following subset of L2 (Rn ):
B = {f ∈ L2 (Rn ) : f ∈ L∞ (Rn ), f has compact support.}
The following lemma comes from [2].

Lemma 1. Two families {eα : α ∈ A} and {˜
eα : α ∈ A} constitute a dual pair
if and only if they are Bessel sequences and satisfy
P (f, g) :=

f, eα e˜α , g = f, g ,
α∈A

for all f ,g in a dense subset of H.
Given {Aj }j∈Z and B, we need the following notations:
−∗
∧ = {α ∈ Rn : α = A−∗
(Zn )},
j m, (j, m) ∈ Z × B

I(α) = {(j, m) ∈ Z × B −∗ (Zn ) : α = A−∗
j m}.
Assume that {Aj }j∈Z satisfy the following conditions: there exist β ∈ (0, 1),
q ∈ Z+ such that
Aj A−1
j+1 ≤ 1,

Aj A−1
j+q ≤ β for any j ∈ Z,

(2)

A−1
j+1 Aj ≤ 1,

A−1
j+q Aj ≤ β for any j ∈ Z.

(3)

Then we have
Theorem 2. Suppose that ψ, ψ˜ ∈ L2 (Rn ) have the property that the following
two functions are locally integrable:

ψ(Aj ω) ,

Then for f, g ∈ B, P (f, g) converges absolutely. Moreover,

ψ(A
j
(j,m)∈I(α)

for a.e. ω ∈ Rn and for all α ∈ ∧, if and only if P (f, g) = f, g for all f, g ∈ B.
By Theorem 2 and Lemma 1, the following two theorems are the immediate
consequences.
Theorem 3. Assume that Ψ, Ψ˜ ⊂ L2 (Rn ) are two Bessel sequences,

Theorem 4. ψ ∈ L2 (Rn ) satisﬁes

ψ(Aj ω)ψ(Aj (ω + A−1

(j,m)∈I(α)

for a.e. ω ∈ Rn and for all α ∈ ∧, if and only if {ψj,k }j,k is a tight frame with
constant 1 for L2 (Rn ).

Proof of Main Results

In fact, we only give the proof of Theorem 2.
Proof of Theorem 2: We ﬁrst prove that P (f, g) is absolutely convergent.
Now, let
f, ψj,k ψ˜j,k , f , j ∈ Z.
Gj :=
k∈Zn

Using the Parseval identity, it is easy to show
Gj =

s)ψ(Aj ω + B −∗ s))dω.
f (ω + A−1

˜ j ω)(
f (ω)ψ(A

s∈Zn

Thus, we would like to show that j∈Z Gj is absolutely convergent. To do so,
it is enough to show that the following two series are absolutely convergent:
˜ j ω)f (ω)ψ(Aj ω)dω,
f (ω)ψ(A

I :=
Rn

j∈Z

and
˜ j ω)(
f (ω)ψ(A

Since

˜ j ω)ψ(Aj ω + B −∗ s) ≤ 1 ( ψ(A
ψ(A

˜ f that I is absolutely convergent.
It follows from (4) and the conditions on ψ, ψ,

On the other hand, for h ∈ {ψ, ψ},

Since f ∈ B, it follows from (2) and (3) that there exists constant C0 > 0 such
that for each j ∈ Z, ω ∈ Rn , the number of s ∈ Zn \ {0} satisfying

and F is compact in Rn \ {0}. By (2) and (3), {Aj }j∈Z is

an MFS (see [4]). Therefore there exists constant K > 0 such that
n
χF (A−1
j ω) ≤ K for any ω ∈ R \ {0}.

(7)

j∈Z

Now, it follows from (5), (6) and (7) that the series II is convergent. Hence, we
can rearrange the series for P (f, f ), to obtain
f (ω)f (ω + α)

P (f, f ) =
α∈∧

|det B|

˜ j ω)ψ(Aj (ω + α)) dω.
ψ(A
(j,m)∈I(α)

Then using the polarization identity for the form P , we get the suﬃciency of
the theorem.
Next, we prove the necessary condition. From the above discussion, we
have, let
P (f, g) = M (f, g) + R(f, g),
where
M (f, g) :=

1
|det B|

˜ j ω)ψ(Aj ω) dω,

R(f, g) :=

(j,m)∈I(α)

Now, ﬁx ω0 ∈ Rn \ {0} and let
f1 (ω) =

μ(Hk )1/2 0 k

where μ(·) is the Lebesgue measure on Rn and

Here, we have used the fact #(Qj,k \ {0}) ≤ Cμ(Aj A−1
k (Δ − Δ)), which can be
obtained by (2), (3).
Similarly, we can estimate the second factor. Now, using (2) and (3), it is easy
to prove that:
(P1 ) there exist k1 , k2 ∈ Z such that the intersection of any k2 sets in {Aj (ω0 +
Hk )}k≥k1 ,j≥k+c is empty.
(P2 ) there exist constants k3 ∈ Z, λ > 1 such that for any k ≥ k3 , j ≥ k + c,
Aj (ω0 + Hk ) ⊂ {ω : |ω| ≥ k3 λj |ω0 |}.

Using (8), (9), (P1 ) and (P2 ), we can get |R(f1 , f1 )| → 0 when k → ∞. Then,
by Lebesgue theorem, we have

which proves our claim for α = 0. This also shows that
M (f, g) = f, g ,
for any f, g ∈ B.
To complete the proof of our theorem, choose α0 ∈ ∧ \ {0}, and write
R(f, g) = R1 (f, g) + R2 (f, g),
where
R1 (f, g) =

R2 (f, g) =

Next, let ω0 ∈ Rn \ {0} be any Lebesgue point of functions

χω0 +Hk (ω), g2 (ω) =
χω +H (ω).
1/2
μ(Hk )
μ(Hk )1/2 0 k

Then, using Lebesgue Theorem, we have
lim R1 (f2 , g2 ) =

k→∞

|det B|

˜ j ω0 )ψ(Aj (ω0 + α0 )).
ψ(A
(j,m)∈I(α0 )

To estimate R2 (f2 , g2 ), we note that if g2 (ω)f2 (ω + α) = 0, then
α ∈ α0 + A−1
k (

).

Since α = A−1
j m ∈ ∧ \ {0, α0 }, it follows from (2), (3) that there exist J0 ∈ Z
such that for any j ≤ J0 , m ∈ B −∗ (Zn ) \ {0}, A−1

j m∈

where J1 ∈ Z. Using (2) and (3), when k is large enough, for each j(J0 ≤ j ≤ J1 )
the number of m satisfying m ∈ (Aj α0 +Aj Dk ) is a constant which is not related
on k. Thus, by Lebesgue theorem, we have limk→∞ R2,2 (f2 , g2 ) = 0.
To estimate R2,1 (f2 , g2 ), we would like to prove that for each ε > 0 and k
which is large enough, there exists J1 ∈ Z such that R2,1 (f2 , g2 ) ≤ ε.
In fact, similar to R(f1 , f1 ), we have
R2,1 (f2 , g2 ) ≤

there exists a constant C such that for any j ≥ J1 ,

Remarks

In the proof of Theorem 2, we have used the following result in some places.
Remark 3.1. If (2) and (3) holds, then there exist constants C, q ∈ Z+ and
β ∈ (0, 1) such that
(i) for any p, j ∈ Z+ , j ≥ pq and ξ ∈ Rn , |Aj ξ| ≥ C( β1 )p |ξ|.
(ii) for any p, −j ∈ Z+ , j ≤ −pq and ξ ∈ Rn ,|Aj ξ| ≤ Cβ p |ξ|.
(iii) for any j, k ∈ Z, j < k and ξ ∈ Rn , we have |Ak ξ| ≥ C( β1 )

k−j

Remark 3.2. Assume that A is an expand matrix, S = Γ \∪−1
j=−∞ (A Γ ), where
n
Γ is a bounded measurable subset in R , supx,y∈Γ x − y < 1 and the origin is
an interior point of Γ . Let ψ = χS . By Theorem 4, ψ is a tight frame function
with respect to dilation sequence {Aj }j∈Z . If Di (i = 1, · · · , p) are nonsingular
matrices which is commutative with A, and Asp+i = As+1 Di for any s ∈ Z, i =
1, · · · , p, then using Theorem 4 again, it is easy to show that ψ is also a tight
frame function with respect to dilation sequence {Aj }j∈Z .
