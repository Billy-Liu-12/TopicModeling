Abstract. The paper address needs for training and simulation tools needed to
address a multitude of threats to national security. In order to most effectively
prevent terrorist threats, government agencies need to be able to train for
extreme event scenarios that are very difficult to realistically replicate. A
crucial aspect of the training challenge is to provide scalable, real-time handson training capability that includes not only visual demonstration and
description of possible threats but also the capability for the individuals to
interactively practice specific threat scenarios and be evaluated on their
performance. This paper describes a bio-feedback system incorporated into the
training simulator for the mission critical practices.

1 Identification and Significance
One of the major goals of human computer interaction (HCI) studies is to develop
adaptive, smart computer systems, which are reconfigured based on user response.
Such systems use biometric identification such as facial recognition, fingerprint
recognition and eye tracking in order to customize access to the system. However,
such systems do not adapt to the user need based on their psycho-physiological
conditions. This paper describes development of non-invasive touch based system,
which will allow tuning a computer based training system to the user emotional and
stress levels.
The system is based upon the fact that during the operation of a computing device,
the user stays in almost permanent manual contact with an input device, such as a
mouse, tracking ball, joystick or for more advanced version of the simulators
integrated with motion or eye tracking devices. This paper will describe the
incorporation of sensors to monitor the physiological conditions, such as galvanic
skin response (GSR), electric skin resistance (ESR), and temperature. Based on the
sensory response, the computer system would be able to determine stress level and
emotional condition of the user, visual-somatic response and adjust itself to provide
better training and determine if the user is suitable to the task assigned.

There are many practical applications for such a system. For example, it could
allow parental control of minors, allowing them to play computer games at an
emotionally safe level. The described system can enable user interface developers to
better monitor the human response to a prototype. Also, the system will enable game
developers to dynamically adjust the difficulty level based upon the player’s
condition. The system can also be integrated into a car steering wheel along with an
onboard computer to monitor the motorist’s condition during the trip and prevent
him/her from falling asleep at the wheel. But one of the most important applications
of the system is to monitor the work related stress and enable failure prevention in
mission critical tasks in nuclear stations, hazardous chemical, oil factories and other
high risk areas.
Today’s governments face the monumental challenge of addressing a multitude of
threats to national security. In order to most effectively prevent terrorist threats,
government agencies need to be able to train for extreme event scenarios that are very
difficult to realistically replicate. A crucial aspect of the training challenge is the
ability to provide a large number individuals amongst numerous agencies with a
scalable, real-time hands-on training capability that includes not only visual
demonstration and description of possible threats but also the capability for the
individuals to interactively practice specific threat scenarios and be evaluated on their
performance.
At present, such systems do not exist in the market. However, active research is
being performed by several groups, such as, IBM BlueEyes team [1, 9], MIT Media
Lab [2] and other organizations [1]. The major advantage of the described technique
compared to those reported in literature is the monitoring of visual-motor reactions
and attention distributions, both very important parameters for training simulator and
game developers. For example, the “Emotional mouse”, the experimental system
developed at IBM is limited to measuring six emotional states – anger, disgust, fear,
happiness, sadness and surprise.
This paper describes a system which is significantly more advanced than those
being investigated. The system will have a significant impact on the human computer
interaction development in the next decade and will lead to more expressive
communication with machines.

2 Overview
Paul Ekman’s facial expression work demonstrated that there is a correlation
between a person’s psychological state and a person’s physiological measurements.
Based on this work he developed Facial Action Coding System [3]. Later, Dryer [4]
determined how physiological measures could be used to distinguish the various
emotional states. He also demonstrated that people consider a computer system as
having personality [5], and a system having a similar personality as the user leads to
better collaboration [6]. In his experiments Johnson [7] used video cameras to
determine users psychological state and concluded that there is a correlation between
patterns in user behavior and users psychological state.

Wendy Ark [9] in her work reported that during normal computer use (creating and
editing documents and surfing the web) people spend about 30% of their total
computer time touching their input device. In addition, it has been demonstrated that
the major physiological parameters, associated with physiological state, are Galvanic
Skin Response (GSR), Electric Skin Resistance (ESR), General Somatic Activity
(GSA), temperature (TEM), heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) [3, 4].
Based on the prior art we decided to integrate a bio-sensing device into motion or
eye tracking hardware and make it in a way, that it actively monitors the above listed
variables — GSR, ESR, GSA and HR.

3 Technical Characteristics
The major objective was to develop a scanning device, which would be able to
monitor the real time psycho-physiological state of the trainee. We term such a
system a ‘bio-sensor’. The bio-sensor will enable the study of
-

Psychosomatic and psychotherapeutic issues related to the HCI
Psychological state and personality traits of the subject
Characteristic peculiarities
Mental performance level
Central nervous system state
Functional abilities of central regulation and peripheral blood circulation of
cardio-vascular system
Psychological tension and stress level

In order to complete these tasks three major objectives need to be achieved (Figure
1). First algorithms to process analog signals from the sensors should be developed.
Second, a set of psycho-physiological tests has to be developed to collect and analyze
data. And third, an interface should be developed for both report generation and other
software integration.

Fig. 1. Major modules of the system

Each of these three modules is described in more detail below.

3.1 Data Collection Module
The data collection module consists of two parts – hardware sensors and control
software. A data collection module has following characteristics:
-

Include sensors of photo-plethysmogram and GSR
Tunable discretization frequency up to 1k Hz
Bandwidth of bio-amplifiers not less then 0.1-1000 Hz
Electric shock protection
Power supply from computer

Control software properties:
-

Real time signal filtering
Spectral and autocorrelation analysis algorithms
Bio-amplifiers bandwidth control
Signal intensity control
Automatic detection of photo-plethysmogram parameters

3.2 Data Interpretation Module
This is the main analytical module of the system. The goal of this module is to
manage data collection and to extract meaningful information from the data. It should
provide a set of tests and analysis algorithms, which will study different aspect of
HCI. The main functions of the data interpretation module will include:
-

Chrono-cardiography analysis based of variation principle
Simple and complex visual-semantic response study
Attention distribution test
Associative test
Response speed test
Stress level determination

3.3 Interface Module
In order to be a useful tool the system has to be able to generate reports and
communicate to other software. This brings us to the third objective – to generate an
easy to use report generation system and application programmer interface (API).
Report generation system should be able to display graphical physiological data and
test results as well as being able to save results and provide access to stored user data.
The API should be easy to use and allow third party software developers easy access
to collected data and diagnostic results.

4 Conclusion and Future Work
Development of a smart adaptive computer system has been one of the major
challenges of computer science in the last decade. Several different tools and
methodologies have been developed in order to obtain some physiological feedback
from user. One of the most well known applications of such systems is the polygraph
or “lie detector” which is now widely used in criminology and human resources and
cardio-systems in gymnasiums. Several other techniques have been used for
biofeedback in psychotherapy.
The main concept of this work was to develop an easy to use system, which
includes a bio-sensing device and software package integrated with modern training
simulator hardware, which will determine users psychological conditions using
biofeedback. Data from the IBM research team working on “emotional mouse” (Table
1-4) shows strong correlation between emotional state and physiological data. The
next step that we are planning is to extract not only the emotional data but also the
stress level, activity level and attention level.
We are planning to integrate different sensors in to the motion or eye tracker
hardware. First, we will use infrared detectors in order to obtain photoplethysmogram of the computer user. This signal is depending on blood flow in
fingers and allows the detection RR intervals (time between two consecutive heart
pulses). Performing statistical analysis and filtering of the RR intervals, we will
obtain heart rate and heart rate variability (VF) [10]. A high value of VF indicates that
the user is falling asleep and a low value of VF indicates that the user is overloaded or
tired. Average RR value for human is 900-1000 milliseconds (equivalent of heart rate
60-70), and average value of VF is 4-5%. Based on this data, the system will be able
to warn when the user is too tired or about to fall asleep or getting too stressed to
adequately complete the mission.
Another analytical technique that we are planning to incorporate into our system is
the analysis of video-somatic reaction. This technique is excellent for action based
computer game developers. The system will collect reaction time of the user and
apply mathematical models similar to the one used to determine a heart rate
variability. This will allow us to correlate to the psychological condition of the user.
In this case, we will measure average response time and its variability. The advantage
of this method is that no hardware modification is required.
Combination of heart rate variability, video-somatic reaction based methods and
emotional state determination technique similar to one described by IBM [9] will
allow error minimization and generate a system which will be able to help make a
computer which will be more adjustable to users psychological state
