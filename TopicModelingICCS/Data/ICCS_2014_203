Abstract
Foreign exchange (Forex) market is the largest trading market in the world. Predicting the trend of the
market and performing automated trading are important for investors. Recently, machine learning
techniques have emerged as a powerful trend to predict foreign exchange (FX) rates. In this paper, we
propose a new classificat ion method for identifying up, down, and sideways trends in Forex market
foreign exchange rates. A mu lti-scale feature ext raction approached is used for training mu ltiple
classifiers for each trend. Bayesian voting is used to find the ensemble of classifiers fo r each trend.
Performance of the system is validated using different metrics. The results show superiority of
ensemble classifier over individual ones.

1 Introduction
Foreign exchange market, also known as Forex is a currency trading market spread all around the
globe. According to the Bank for International Settlements [1], average of daily exchange in foreign
exchange markets is $5.3 trillion in April 2013. This huge amount of turnover makes this market the
largest trading market in the world which is appro ximately 160 times larger than the New Yo rk Stock
Exchange. This market is traditionally used by central banks, commercial banks, and hedge funds for
currency trading. However, by the advent of the internet and its development, the market became
available for s mall retailers. In Forex market, trading is done by selling and buying currency pairs, i.e.
EUR/USD. There are several currency pairs, although the major ones in term of the amount of daily
transactions are Euro vs US Dollar (EUR/USD), Australian Dollar vs US Do llar (AUD/ USD), Great
Britain Pound vs US Do llar (GBP/USD), US Do lla r vs Canadian Dollar (USD/ CAD), US Dollar vs
Swiss Franc (USD/CHF) and US Dollar vs Japanese Yen (USD/JPY).

The main strategy in this market is to buy low and sell high. For example, a trader figures out that
Euro will increase in p rice against the US dollar, so he/she will buy EUR/ USD pair at lower price and
when the price appreciates, sell the currency pair to gain profit.
Forex market is open 24 hours a day and 5 days of a week. Due to high volatility of the market, it
is important to mon itor the market constantly. It is impossible for the human to monitor the market 24
hours a day and perform the manual trading. Moreover, traders may have unrealistic expectations of
return with limited risk. Fear causes traders to make poor trading decisions and lack of d iscipline may
cause traders to violate trading rules that they promised to follow [2]. However, traders can avoid
these pitfalls by using Expert Advisors. Expert Advisors are co mputer programs that perform
automatic trading with no human emot ions involved, and are based on logic and discipline. Expert
advisors can monitor the market 24 hours a day and make trades based on their algorithmic discipline.
New advancements in machine learn ing made it possible for expert advisors to learn fro m pervious
market data and make profitable trades [2,16]. Most of the recent works try to predict the market based
on the previous prices. In [3], Yao et al proposed a forex market predictor based on a neural network,
which was trained using price data and technical indicators. They tested the system using pairing of
American Dollar with five other major currencies. They showed that the system provides pro mising
results except for Japanese Yen. Neu ral netwo rk also used in [4] for forecasting foreign exchange (FX)
rates of Australian dollar against six d ifferent currencies. In th is paper they investigate using of
Standard Backpropagation (SBP), Backpropagation with Bayesian Regularizat ion (BPR) and Scaled
Conjugate Gradient (SCG) fo r training neural network using five moving average indicators. Their
result showed that SCG model outperformed the other two. In [5], Pacelli et. al designed optimal
mu ltilayer perceptron topologies using genetic algorith m mu lti-objective Pareto-Based. Three best
designed topologies could predict three days ahead of last available p rices with an accuracy of 60%,
70% and 80% on validation data. A comparison between feed forward neural network and Takagi Sugeno type neuro-fuzzy system at [6] for forecasting the average monthly forex rates showed that
neuro-fuzzy system performed better in term of root-mean-square error (RMSE) and training time.
Kamru zzaman et. al [7] introduced Support Vector Machine (SVM) to the forex market. They
investigate the effect of different kernel function and regularizat ion parameters on currency trading.
Their study revealed that polynomial and radial basis kernel are better choices for forex trading.
Unlike the traditional models wh ich decided based on a single model, [8] used bootstrap methods to
train mu ltiple learners and then combined the results from each model to make the final decision. They
also used neural network as their base learning method. Single indicator does not always produce right
signals for trad ing. In order to alleviate this issue, Liu et. al [9] propos ed fusion of mu ltiple indicators
based on Dempster-Shafer theory. Their experiment revealed that fused indicator can produce more
accurate results than a single one in forex t rading. In [10], a machine learn ing approach with sparse
grid comb ination technique is used for predicting the FX rates. FX rates signal is transformed to a Ddimensional regression problem and sparse grid is used to cope with the curse of dimensionality in the
D-dimensional regression problem. Khashei et. al [11] introduced fuzzy auto regressive integrated
moving average (FA RIMA) models in co mbination of probabilistic neural classifier for forecasting
Forex market which is robust to missing data.
Due to volatility of the market, predict ing the exact FX rate is error-prone. Moreover, predicted FX
rates do not provide strategies for trading in Forex market. In this paper, we present a new paradig m
based on a completely d ifferent approach to tackle the problem of automated trading in the Forex
market. Instead of predicting the actual FX rates, we devised a new classificat ion approach to identify
trends in the market. The approach is rooted in over ten years of observing Forex market by the
founder of CTS Forex international currency trading company [2]. We, thus, classify Forex market
trends into three classes: 1) up trends, when the FX rate increase by a certain amount, 2) down trends,
when the FX rate decreases by a certain amount, and 3) sideway trends, when the FX rates fluctuates
in a specified interval. Proposed approach uses the zigzag indicator to identify these trends in
historical data on FX rates. We ext ract features fro m these trends using our mu lti-scale feature

extraction approach. Multiple classifiers are trained using these features. Bayesian voting is used to
create the ensemble of these classifiers wh ich can recognize trends in the market. By predicting the
trend of the market, we can buy the currency pair during up trends and sell it during down t rends. The
method thus is computationally efficient, and free of prediction erro rs.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section II we present our feature ext raction.
Zigzag indicator is introduced to find profitable t imes fro m price data. Data clearing and feature mu lti scale feature extract ion will be discussed. Section III describes the training phase. In this section we
describe Gaussian classifiers for classifying up, down, and sideway trend and Bayesian voting is
introduced to make the final decision. Sect ion IV presents experimental results and in section V we
have our concluding remarks.

2 Feature Extraction
In this section we introduce zigzag technical indicator for indicating up trends and down trends.
We present data clearing, features and multi-scale feature extraction method.

2.1 Zigzag Technical Indicator
The zig zag technical indicator is used to illustrate the market trends. It ignores small fluctuation in
the rate movement and represents the rate signal using monotone linear appro ximation. Figure 1
demonstrates the zig zag indicator on foreign exchange rates of EUR/USD. Zigzag indicator operates
based on a threshold parameter that indicates the percentage of fluctuation which should be ignored in
the estimation. This threshold identifies the reversal point of the trend. For examp le, if the threshold is
set to 10% and the foreign exchange rate changes at least 10% in one direction and then changes for at
least 10% in the opposite direction, then the transition point will become a new vertex for zig zag.
Connecting consecutive vertices will produce the zigzag trend ind icator.
Transition points of the zig zag indicator are potential t imes for making profitable trades. Trading
between two consecutive transition points can be profitable since the market trend is comp letely
known. This property of zig zag indicator cannot be used to trade in real time since in relies on future
prices to find the current transition point. However, the pattern of local changes in the data can be
useful for recognizing these transition points in real time.

2.2 Data Clearing and Features
Meta Trader is a trading platfo rm for forex market that can be used to make t rades manually and
also using expert advisors [2]. It also provides historical data of the market for d ifferent currency pairs.
The problem with historical data provided by Meta Trader is that there are lots of missing data points
which can dramatically influence on training and performance of the syst em.
To overcome with this problem, we co mbined historical rate fro m the Meta Trader 5 platform
(which is the current version) with historical rates of Meta Trader 4. Co mbination of h istorical data
fro m Meta Trader 5 and 4 cannot comp letely co mpensate for missing data. Table 1 shows the
frequency of gaps duration in co mb ination of historical rate data. We used bi-linear interpolation to
estimate missing data in prices. After combining historical prices, zigzag indicator applied to the data.
The min imu ms and maximu ms in the zig zag curves (transition points) indicate locations that the
price trend changes. These points can be potential times for selling (maximu ms of zig zag) or buying
(minimu ms of zigzag) the currency pair because the price will decrease or increase by a specific
amount. To ext ract features fro m these locations, we consider one hour before and one over after of
these minimu ms or maximu m locations as our raw features. These raw features may contain these
minimu ms or maximu m locations as our raw features. These raw features may contain interpolated
data which are not the actual values of the market. In order to prevent training using too much
artificial data, we ignored raw features that have more than 20 interpolated data points.
Raw features which contain the exact prices of the market are not robust to a bias value added to
prices. To alleviate this problem we used discrete differentiate of our raw features as the adapted feature
that is going to be used for training. The difference between consecutive prices contains required
information of local changes regardless of the actual price of the pair.

2.3 Multi Scale Feature Extraction
It is important to have features that can represent large fluctuation of data as well as small ones.
Trading platforms provide different sampling rate fro m prices rate signal. Most of them restrict
themselves to 1, 5, 15, 30, 60-minute sampling rates. These sampling rates show the signal in a multiscale manner. However, there is redundant information inside of the scales. For examp le, we can
construct the whole 15-minute sampling rate data using the 5-minute data. This shows that 5 minute
data have all the information of 15-minute data. In order to alleviate this problem, Instead of using
traditional sampling rates, we tried to reduce this redundancy by using a subset of prime nu mbers as the
sampling rates. We use 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, and 29. Using 3-minute sampling rate data, we will
have fine fluctuations of rate s ignal and by going up to the 29-minute sampling rate, small fluctuation
will vanish and the coarse one will become more vivid. Using this new approach we have a mult i scale
features with less redundancy.

3 Training
In the training phase, we proposed using mu ltivariate Gaussian classifier [12]. Figure 1 Shows 3minute features based on their two largest Eigen vectors. As Figure 1 (a) and (b) demonstrate, both up
trend and down trend data have dens distributions. This fact leads us to use mu ltivariate Gaussian
classifiers to classify these two classes. However, Figure 1 (c) demonstrates that there is a substantial
overlap between up trends and down trend features of a same scale. The proposed multi scale features
can alleviate this issue by training a multivariate Gaussian classifier on each scale and then use the
ensemble of these classifiers to come up with a concrete outcome. In following subsection we will
introduce multivariate Gaussian Classifier and Bayesian voting for our ensemble method to make the
final decision.

3.1 Multivariate Gaussian Classifier
Multivariate Gaussian Classifier (M GC) [12] considers that each class of data has a multivariate
Gaussian distribution. Let  ୧ ‫  א‬୬ be features of class , if the probability distribution of  ୧ is Gaussian
with mean vector Ɋ and covariance matrix ȭ, then [12]:

Having the membership probability of each new observation to each class, we can classify new
observations to one of ‫ܥ‬௝ classes. If the membership probability is more than an acceptable probability
threshold ߜ it can be considered as a member of a class with an unknown probability density function.
To classify FX rates, we trained Gaussian classifiers for d ifferent scales of up trend and down trend
features. For each of the trends, nine Gaussian distribution was found that are the hypotheses for that
௖
௖
trend. A hypothesis set ‫ܪ‬௖ ೔ ൌ ሼ݄ଵ ೔ ǡ ǥ ǡ ݄ଽ ೔ ሽ, is the set of all the different scale hypothesis for trend ܿ௜ . In
this case, we have two hypotheses set ‫ܪ‬௖ ೠ೛ and ‫ܪ‬௖ ೏೚ೢ೙ . Every feature vector that is ignored by both of
these hypothesis sets is classified as sideway trend.

3.2 Bayesian Voting
Each hypothesis defines a probability distribution that can predict a class of data points based on
conditional probability. In our setting for predicting Forex market trends, there are nine hypotheses for
௖
௖
classifying each trend. More formally ‫ܪ‬௖ ೔ ൌ ሼ݄ଵ ೔ ǡ ǥ ǡ ݄ଽ ೔ ሽ is a hypothesis set for discriminating class ୧
fro m the rest of classes in our problem. Prediction of each hypothesis may be different from the other.
To combine the result of all the hypothesis in ୡ ౟ , we used Bayesian voting technique.
Bayesian voting [14] finds the ensemble of all the hypothesis by making a weighted summation
over all the hypothesis in ୡ ౟ . Given a new data point  and our training set , we are interested to find

‫ ݌‬ሺ‫ܿ߳ݔ‬௜ ȁܵǡ ‫ܪ‬௖ ೔ ሻ. In order to find this probability, summation of hypothesis in ୡ ౟ weighted by their
posterior probability is used. We can write this weighted summation as follows [14]:
‫ ݌‬ሺ‫ܿ߳ݔ‬௜ ȁ ܵǡ ‫ܪ‬௖ ೔ ሻ ൌ ෍ ݄ሺ‫ݔ‬ሻ‫݌‬ሺ݄ȁܵሻ
௛‫א‬ு ೎

(7)

೔

where ݄ሺ‫ݔ‬ሻ is the response of the hypothesis ݄ to the data point ‫ ݔ‬and ‫݌‬ሺ݄ȁܵሻ is the posterior
probability of hypothesis ݄.

4 Experimental Results
In this section we explain our train ing data used for creating classifiers and the test data for
validating our approach. Since we do not predict FX rates, as majority of other methods do, there are
no comparators in that category. Instead, performance metrics are used to evaluate the developed
system.

4.1 Data Collection
FX rate of EUR/USD fro m the beginning of January 2000 to the end of December 2013 were
extracted fro m both Metatrader 5 and Metatrader 4 database. After comb ining the results fro m these
databases, the zig zag indicator is applied to the FX rates. FX rates in the interval of one hour before
and one hour after maximu m and min imu m points in the zigzag were extracted as sample points for up
trend and down trends. For the sideway, sample data was extracted fro m intervals between maximu m
and min imu m points of zigzag. Sample points that have more than 20 missing FX rates were ignored
for train ing of the classifier. Samp les that are extracted fro m of January 2000 to the end of December
2010 were used for training the classifier. The rest of samples are used for testing the classifier.

4.2 Performance Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the system we used three performance metr ics namely, recall,
precision, and accuracy [15]. In order to define metrics, we should introduce true positive (tp), true
negative (tn), false positive (fp) and false negative (fn). True positive (tp) is the nu mber of data points
that are member of class ୧ and are classified correct ly as class ୧ . True negative (tn) is the nu mber o f
data points that are not members of class ୧ and are classified correctly as not members of class ୧ .
False positive (fp) is the number of data points that are not members of class ୧ and are classified
wrongly as member of class ୧ . False negative (fn) is the nu mber of data points that are member of
class ୧ and are classified wrongly as not members of class ୧ . We can define recall, precision, and
accuracy using the following formula [15]:
‫݌ݐ‬
ܴ݈݈݁ܿܽ ൌ 

Recall shows the ratio correctly classified data points of class ୧ to the all nu mber of all the data
points classified as class ୧ . Precision is the rat io correct ly classified data points of class ୧ to the

2071

Classiﬁcation of Trends in Foreign Exchange Market

number of all data points that should be classified as class ୧ . Accuracy is the proportion of correctly
classified data points.

4.3 Test Results
Two sets of hypothesis for up trend and down trend data were trained. For each set we trained nine
hypotheses which are correspondence with different sampling rate of FX rates. We used Bayesian
voting to combine each set of hypothesis and make decisions for classifying test data. If the
membership probability of a new data point is more than an acceptance probability threshold (Ɂ), then it
is considered as a member of the corresponding class. If the new data point does not classify as up or
down trend, we consider it to be a sideway trend. The performance of the system is measured in term of
recall, precision, and accuracy. In order to show the superiority of ensemb le method performance
measures is reported for each of the individual hypothesis and ensemble hypothesis. Table 2, 3, and 4
show the precision, recall and accuracy of each hypothesis individually for different acceptance
probability threshold (Ɂ). In the last row of each table the performance measure is reported for the
ensemble of classifiers (‫ܪ‬ሻ. Performance measures in each table show that ensemble classifier ‫ ܪ‬can
outperform every individual classifier. Recall of ensemble hypothesis shows that a promising number of
up and down trends are recognized correctly. Due to similarity of patterns in sideway trend and up and
down trend, some of sideway trends were wrongly recognized as up and down trends. The low
precision value is due to this similarity. However, these misclassifications do not result in losing of
money in trades since it is not misclassification of up and down trends.

Figure 3 shows the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve fo r every hypothesis (݄௜ ) and
the ensemble (‫ܪ‬ሻ. As the figure 3 illustrates, for a specific false positive rate, ensemble classifier
always has the highest true positive rate.

5 Concluding Remarks
In this paper, we presented a radically new approach for automated trad ing in the Forex market.
The key methodological develop ment is in introducing a classification method which uses mult i-scale

features extracted fro m FX rate. The underlying distribution of each scale feature was calculated as a
classifiers and Bayesian voting method used to find the ensemble o f these classifiers. Recall,
precision, and average accuracy showed the superiority of the ensemble classifier. Experimental
results showed that the proposed system is able to identify up and down trends in the FX rate signal
accurately.
Future direction fo r improvement includes extracting mo re features fro m FX rate and analyzing the
performance of other ensemble methods to combine the results of classifiers.
