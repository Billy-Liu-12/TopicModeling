(MRI), Electroencephalography (EEG), and Electromyography (MEG) enable to take a picture
of the brain connections of patients [27]. In particular, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
[24] ensures to achieve information about anatomic connectivity or functional connectivity and
represents the main source for deriving information about connectomes.
Afterwards, the connectome data obtained from MRI experiments need to be modeled in
a suitable representation. A useful representation of connectome data is given by the graph
theory, that ensures the modeling of such data into a single network model. In fact, the network
models have been widely used by different approaches to extract clinically relevant information
[4, 11] due to their capability to summarize the characteristics of a complex network with few
measures and to understand the organization of both entire networks and individual network
elements [3].
A typical MRI experiment produces a series of images, either from intra-subject or intersubject that need to be modelled and analyzed. The modeling regards the representation of
connectome as a network and it still remains an open issue related to different definitions of
the nodes and the edges. The analysis consists of the comparison of networks into a spatial
domain. Typically, the MRI images are modeled as networks whose nodes are region of interest
(ROI) and the edges represent functional or anatomical connections. Then, the registration
process 1 among the network and a brain atlas is performed. In this way, the nodes of the
networks correspond to the atlas regions by defining anatomically meaningful regions [28]. An
alternative method, proposed in [25], is based on the application of atlas-free parcellation and on
the construction of individual connectomes only in the network space. In this network domain,
the comparison is performed by recurring to network alignment (NA) approaches. In general,
the techniques for the alignment of biological networks [1] fall into four sub-categories: local
alignment, to find small conserved motifs across networks, and global alignment, which attempts
to find a best mapping between all nodes of the two networks, pairwise alignment to align two
networks and multiple alignment that align multiple networks. The NA approaches are widely
applied in molecular biology analysis [14], but they have not been explored yet in relation
to MRI connectomics. For this reason, in a previous work (see [15]), we tested two global
alignment algorithms to build the alignments among the diffusion MRI-derived brain networks.
We analyzed the alignment results in term of topological quality measures and according to
these analyses, we identified the best alignment algorithm to align the diffusion MRI-derived
brain networks. However, recent studies have demonstrated in an independent way that the
multiple alignment algorithms are able to extract deeper information than pairwise alignment
algorithms when these one are applied to molecular biology analysis.
According to this evidence, we wanted to test multiple alignment algorithms on MRI connectomics. In this paper, we selected three existing state of the art multiple alignment algorithms
to build the alignment of diffusion MRI-derived brain networks. The algorithms tested here
are MultiMAGNA++ [26], GEDEVO-M [9] and IsoRankN [12]. The algorithms are applied
to build the multiple alignment among the diffusion MRI-derived brain networks. After the
alignments were built, we compared the performance of these algorithms. The rest of paper
is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses modeling of connectome, Section 3 discusses the
comparison of connectome with multiple alignment algorithms, Section 4 presents a case study.
Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

Building Connectomes: Definition of Nodes and Edges

The application of graph theory to the study of connectomes presents some pitfalls related to
the optimal definition of nodes and edges An ideal definition of nodes should group a set of
neurons according to maximal functional homogeneity within nodes and the maximal functional
heterogeneity among different nodes. This process of subdivision of the brain into homogeneous,
non-overlapping and large-scale, regions is conducted by the using information provided by
techniques based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [23] and it is known as “parcellation
”. There currently exist three parcellation-based connectome approaches:
1. Parcellation of the brain by using predefined anatomical templates that consists of
the registration of the structural images from MRI to anatomical atlas based on the
Brodmann areas [7];
2. Parcellation of the brain by using randomly generated templates [6] that are characterized by parcels (brain region) of roughly equal size;
3. Connectivity-based parcellations that aim to delineate brain regions according to the
similarities in structural or functional connectivity patterns.
However, each method presents some pitfalls. For example, in the parcellation of brain with
predefined anatomical templates evident biases [25] may occur due to inter-subject variability.
This bias may lead to a mismatch among the cortical surface analyzed and the borders of the
Brodmann areas. Thus, the choice of parcellation scheme is fundamental for the significant
impact that has on subsequent analysis.

Figure 1: Definition of nodes using an atlas-free random parcellation and edges using diffusion
MRI and tractography.
The definition of the edges is also currently an open challenge. In fact, the edges of a brain
graph depend on the type of connectivity measured, and method used to quantify it. As mentioned above, brain connectivity can refer to different aspects of brain organization including
(i) anatomical connectivity consisting of axonal fibers connecting cortical and subcortical regions inferred from diffusion imaging (see Figure 1), and (ii) functional connectivity defined as
the observed statistical correlations of the Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal
between brain regions.
In this paper, we focus on the random, atlas-free definition of nodes in individual subjects
(see Figure 1), which can allow for a fully network-driven way of looking at the brain and
comparing brains of different subjects and, potentially, species [25].

Comparison of Connectomes

The identification of an accurate node mapping between atlas-free networks may offer significant
details on the comparison of brains groups of subjects, such as healthy versus diseased subjects.
Formally, a graph G is defined as G = {V, E}, where V is a finite set of nodes and E is a
finite set of edges. Let G1 = {V1 , E1 } and G2 = {V2 , E2 } be two graphs, where V1,2 are sets
of nodes and E1,2 are sets of edges, a network alignment is the mapping between the nodes of
the input networks that maximizes the similarity between mapped entities. From a theoretical
point of view, the graph alignment problem consists of finding an alignment function (or a
mapping) f : V1 → V2 that maximizes a cost function Q. The similarity between the graphs
is defined by a cost function, Q(G1 , G2 , f ), also known as the quality of the alignment. Let
f be an alignment between two graphs G1 and G2 , given a node u from G1 , f (u) is the set
of nodes from G2 that are aligned under f to u. Q expresses the similarity among two input
graphs with respect to a specific alignment f and the formulation of Q strongly influences the
mapping strategy.
There exist different formulations of Q that fall into the following classes:
Topological Similarity: Graphs are aligned by considering only edge topology, so that
the perfect alignment is reached when input graphs are isomorphic.
Node Similarity: Such function considers the similarity among mapped nodes. Nodes
of the aligned graphs can be more or less similar to each other. Thus the alignment should
align each node of one graph to the most similar node of the other one given a node similarity
functions, s(v1 , v2 ) → R, v1 ∈ V1 , v2 ∈ V2 .
Hybrid approaches: Some recent formulations of Q take into account both of the approaches by using a linear combination of such similarities.
The network alignment problem can be formulated in various ways, depending on the kind
of input, pairwise or multiple alignment and the scope of node mapping desired, local or global
alignment. In general, the network alignment can be classified as local alignment or global
alignment. The local alignment aims to find multiple and unrelated regions of isomorphism,
i.e. same graph structure, between the input networks, where each region implies a mapping
independently of other regions. The strategy consists of the mapping or set of mappings between subsets of nodes such that their similarity is maximal over all possible subsets. These
subnetworks correspond to conserved patterns of interaction that can represent a conserved
motif or pattern of activities (a synopsis is available in [5]). Many different network alignment
methods have been proposed in biological fields [13]. The literature contains many algorithms
that address local graph alignment problem, such as, AlignNemo [5] and AlignMCL [16] algorithms. The global alignment aims to find a mapping that should cover all of the nodes of
the input networks, associating each node of a network with one node of the other networks
or marking the node as a gap when no possible match exists. This strategy does not consider
small regions of similarity, i.e. conserved motifs, but tries to find a consistent mapping between
the whole set of nodes of the networks.
Most popular existing methods of global alignment are MAGNA [19], NETAL [17], GHOST
[18], WAVE [22]. For a complete review on global and local network alignment algorithms and
their advantages or disadvantages see [8].
Another way to formulate the network alignment problem takes into account the number
of networks that need to be aligned: pairwise or multiple alignment. The pairwise network
alignment (PNA) involves alignment of two networks at a time and it aims to find similar
regions between two networks. The multiple network alignment (MNA) aligns three or more
networks to each other and builds an alignment consisting of aligned node clusters. Both

pairwise network alignment and multiple network alignment can be local or global, with oneto-one or many-to-many node mappings. The difference between one-to-one and many-to-many
mapping in the pairwise alignment refers the previous discussion on global and local alignment.
The pairwise alignments can search the similar small subnetworks exploiting many- to-many
mapping between nodes of the compared network or can look for the best overlap of the whole
compared networks exploiting one- to-one node mapping. In an alignment of multiple networks,
a many-to-many MNA occurs when an aligned cluster contains more than one node from a
single network, whereas when one node per network is present in every aligned cluster, oneto-one MNA occurs. There exist different proposed multiple network alignment algorithms in
literature such as MultiMAGNA++ [26], GEDEVO-M [9] and IsoRankN [12]. In literature,
both PNA and MNA are applied to build the alignment of protein interaction networks (PINs)
[21]. However, it was detected that MNA leads to deeper biological information than PNA
because it is able to capture functional knowledge that is common to multiple species.
MultiMAGNA++ [26] is a global one-to-one MNA algorithm that uses a genetic algorithm to
build an improved alignment directly optimizing both edge and node conservation while the
alignment is constructed. In details, MultiMAGNA++ simulates a population of alignments
that evolves over time by applying a genetic algorithm and a new function for the crossover of
parent alignments into a superior child alignment that allows for aligning multiple networks.
The genetic algorithm simulates the evolutionary process, guided by the survival of the fittest
principle. The genetic algorithm input consists of an initial population of a given number of
members. In MultiMAGNA++, the members of population are multiple alignments. A multiple
network alignment (MNA) of k networks, ordered in terms of the number of nodes from the
smallest to the largest one, is represented by using k1 permutations which are bijective mappings
between pairs of networks adjacent. The permutations are set of disjoint node clusters that
cover nodes in the k networks. So MNA can be defined as multi-permutation. The members of
a population crossover with each other to produce new members. Only the fitted members are
more likely to crossover. Thus, the child alignment resulting from a crossover function reflects
each parent. In MultiMAGNA++, the crossover function is defined as the midpoint of the
shortest path between two permutations. In this way, the child MNA shares the characteristics
of each of the two parent MNAs. To avoid the size of the population to grow without bound,
the size is kept constant across all generations, with only the fittest members surviving from
one generation to the next. The fitness function is a combined measure of edge conservation
SE and node conservation SN maximized as follow:
αSE + (1 − α)SN

(1)

where α controls the contribution of each node and edge conservation measures and takes
the values between 0 and 1.
The edge conservation measure used in MNA is Conserved Interaction Quality (CIQ). CIQ
is a weighted sum of edge conservation between all pairs of aligned a and b clusters and is
defined as:

|E ,b|cs(a,b)
 a
SE = CIQ = a,b
(2)
|Ea ,b|
a,b

where, |Ea , b| is the number of edges that connect the clusters, and cs(a, b) is edge conservation between two clusters. Let r(a, b) be the number of networks that the edges which connect
the clusters belong to and s(a, b) be the number of networks that contain at least one node in
both clusters, cs(a, b) is equal to 0 if r(a, b) ≤ 1, also cs(a, b) is equal to r(a,b)
s(a,b) .
The node conservation measure for MNA refers to internal cluster quality, i.e, the nodes in

where s(u, v) is the similarity between nodes u and v with respect to some node cost function,
ai is a aligned clusters with i = 1, ..., n, |ai | is the size of ai and P (ai ) is the set of all pairs of
nodes in ai .
The genetic algorithm produces newer generations until the alignment quality cannot be
optimized further.
GEDEVO-M [9] is a global one-to-one MNA algorithm based on an evolutionary algorithm
that uses the Graph Edit Distance (GED) as optimization model for finding the best alignments.
The GED is a general model for the Graph Matching problem and it is defined as the minimal
modifications, in term of deleted and inserted edges, required to transfer a graph into another
graph. GEDEVO-M extends the Graph Edit Distance model to multiple graph instances and
models the alignment building a Topological Multiple one-to-one Network Alignment (TMNA).
Given a set of graphs G, TMNA aims to find a multiple mapping F on G such that the multiple
Graph Edit Distance mGEDF is minimal over all possible multiple mapping on G. By minimizing the mGEDF , the number of edges that are aligned in multiple networks simultaneously
is maximized. The GEDEVO-M builds the alignment by generating an initial multiple mapping
with random permutations. A one-to-one MNA of G graphs is a set of disjoint clusters where
each cluster is represented as a tuple. Thus, GEDEVO-M computes a threshold, defined as the
average over all tuple scores and randomly swaps the tuples that have scores higher than the
threshold. The tuples with score lower than the threshold are also given a certain chance to
be swapped. GEDEVO-M uses a crossover operator to construct a new multiple mapping from
two or more parent individuals of the previous generation. At first, GEDEVO-M computes the
tuple scores for every possible subset of G, then by starting with larger subsets of G, it iterates
over the corresponding tuple scores and assigns some of these tuples to a new multiple mapping
until every subset is considered. GEDEVO-M evaluates the quality of the multiple mapping by
using the S score. The S score depends on the multiple Graph Edit Distance (mGED) and
Graphlet-degree signature distance (GSD) of multiple mapping that computes the difference in
neighboring topologies of potentially matched nodes.
IsoRankN [12] is a global many-to-many MNA alignment tool based a spectral partitioning
method to find dense and clique clusters when the global alignment of multiple networks is
computed. IsoRankN builds a multiple network alignment by local partitioning the graph of
pairwise functional similarity scores. Initially, IsoRankN computes the functional similarity
scores of every pair of nodes of k networks. In this way, a functional similarity graph, where
each edge is weighted by its functional similarity score, is obtained. To find highly similar
near cliques that represent a multiple alignment, IsoRankN applies a star spread method. For
each node, IsoRankN computes all neighbors connected by an edge with weight greater than
a threshold. These represent the stars of a node. Then, the nodes are ordered by the total
weight of the star, and for each the star subset with highly weighted neighborhood is found.
This subset represents a functionally conserved interaction cluster. The process is repeated for
every node not already assigned to functionally conserved interaction cluster. Finally, IsoRankN
performed a merging stars process, by looking at the neighbors of a node and by merging the
stars of two nodes if every member of star of node 1 has node 2 as a neighbor and vice versa.
The process is repeated until all nodes are assigned to a cluster.

Dataset

The dataset consisted of diffusion MRI-derived structural networks of human brains at different
stages of development, starting with neonates [25]. Acquisition of the MRI data was compliant
with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and the study was
approved by the Committee on Human Research (CHR) of the University of California, San
Francisco. Three age groups were included: 4 neonates imaged in the first 4-5 days of life (NE),
4 six-month-old infants (6M), and 4 adults (age 24-31 years) (AD). The two pediatric groups
had transient encephalopathy at birth, but none of the patients had clinical or imaging evidence
of brain injury. The subjects were scanned on a 3T GE MR scanner using a spin echo (SE)
echo planar imaging (EPI) diffusion tensor imaging DTI sequence with parameter described
in [25]. Tensor calculation, tractography, cortical parcellation into N equal-area nodes (Figure
1), and construction of the connectivity matrices was performed as described previously [25].
All networks were binarized with a threshold of 1 streamline. The Table 1 shows the network
parameters.

Results

We selected MultiMAGNA++ [26], GEDEVO-M [9] and IsoRankN [12] algorithms in order to
build a multiple alignment among the brain networks presented above. We built the multiple
alignment of all networks related to same growth stages (NE, 6M, AD) by applying MultiMAGNA++, GEDEVO-M and IsoRankN algorithms. We run all MNA methods on the same
Linux machine with Intel Core i5 and 4GB of RAM. We selected the following MultiMAGNA++
parameters: CIQ as measure of Edge Conservation, the α parameter equal to 0, in order to
consider only topology, whereas the population size, number of generation, fraction of elite
members were set to default values. We tested different parameters and obtained best results
with the default parameters for GEDEVO-M: pop parameter that controls the number of new
individuals per iteration set equal to 1000 and maxsame that controls the stop after N iterations without any score improvement were equal to 3000. To build the multiple alignment with
IsoRankN we set: the max number of iterations K equals to 30, the threshold thresh equals
to 1e−4 , maxveclen equals to 1000000 and the α parameter equal to 1 in order to consider
only network data. The Table 2 reports the run time of MultiMAGNA++, GEDEVO-M and
IsoRankN to build one multiple alignment.

RankN algorithms, we performed an evaluation of alignment quality. For this aim we compared the Edge Correctness (EC) [19] related to the alignments built with MultiMAGNA++,
GEDEVO-M and IsoRankN. In general, the Edge Correctness is defined as the number of edges
conserved under an alignment f with respect to the total number of edges of input networks.
The Table 3 reports the global Edge Correctness computed on the multiple alignment of all networks related to same growth stages NE, 6M, AD by applying MultiMAGNA++, GEDEVO-M
and IsoRankN algorithms.
We should note (Figure 2) that best results in terms of edge conservation were obtained
when applying MultiMAGNA++ as multiple aligner. In fact, the mean edge correctness values
are higher on the alignments built with MultiMAGNA++ than mean edge correctness scores on
alignments obtained with GEDEVO-M and IsoRankN, We found that the reason is related to the
strategy of MultiMAGNA++ to construct the multiple alignment. In fact, MultiMAGNA++
is the unique multiple aligner that directly optimizes edge conservation in addition to node
conservation by using a genetic algorithm, whereas the others MNA algorithms optimize node

improved. This implies an inferior behavior of GEDEVO-M and IsoRankN compared to the
MultiMAGNA++.

Conclusion and Future Work

The brain connectivity is an intricate system of interconnected elements, providing the basis for
integrative brain function. A useful formalism to represent the brain connectivity derives from
graph theory. The graph theoretical modeling of the human connectome has already enabled
important discoveries and will most likely continue to do so in the future. In this study we
proposed to apply three multiple alignment algorithms, MultiMAGNA++, GEDEVO-M and
IsoRankN, to align atlas-free human brain networks at three developmental stages. We analyzed
the alignment results in term of topological quality measures. According to these analyses,
MultiMAGNA++ resulted in the best alignment. Future work is focused on implementation of
an ad hoc algorithm for connectome alignment.
