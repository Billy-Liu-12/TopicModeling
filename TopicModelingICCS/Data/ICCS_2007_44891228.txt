Abstract. Based on the Biot’s dynamic equation and the dynamic theory of
elastic beam, the dynamic responses of an infinite beam resting on a layered
water-saturated poroelastic foundation subjected to moving loads is investigated
by the transmission and reflection matrices (TRM) method in this study.
Applying the triple Fourier transformation, the general solutions for the
water-saturated poroelastic foundation and the beam in the transformed domain
are derived. Utilizing the continuity conditions between each layer and boundary
condition at the surface of the half space, the equivalent stiffness of the layered
water-saturated poroelastic foundation is obtained. Time-space domain solutions
are obtained by means of IFFT arithmetic. The present methodology was
validated by comparing present solutions with some known results. According to
numerical results, it can be seen that the occurrence of a softer middle layer
enhances the deformation of the beam.
Keywords: Moving loads, layered poroelastic foundation, Biot’s theory, infinite
beam, TRM method.

1 Introduction
The dynamic response of an infinite beam resting on a foundation under moving loads
has been a hot topic for engineers for a long time, as the model can be conveniently
used to simulate the railway subjected to moving train loads and pavements used as
roadways. Also, it has been found that most of foundations may consist of one or more
layers at some depth under the surface. Thus, a layered half-space is an appropriate
approximation for the inhomogeneous soils. The steady-state vibration of a beam
supported on an elastic half-space under a moving load has been studied in [1]. The
response of an elastic beam on a visco-elastic layer to a moving constant load is
investigated in [2]. A review of the literature about solving of a layered half-space is
given in [3]. It should be noticed that the transmission and reflection matrix (TRM)
method established by Luco and Apsel [4] is a very important method for solving

Dynamic Responses of an Infinite Beam

dynamic problems of a layered half space. The advantage of the method is that the
mismatched exponential terms are eliminated in all the terms of the TRM. However,
most research has been mainly treated subsoil as elastic or a layered elastic foundation.
The investigation about the layered water-saturated porous medium is in a preliminary
stage. It is well known that a saturated soil is two-phase material consisting of soil
frame and pore water. Consequently, for a saturated soil, the saturated porous medium
model is more realistic than the linear elastic or visco-elastic one. To the best of the
authors’ knowledge, Jin[5] investigate the dynamic responses of an infinite beam on a
poroelastic half space produced by a moving periodic load using a rigorous analytical
method.
In this paper, the response of an infinite beam on a layered poroelastic foundation
subjected to moving load is studied. Timoshenko beam theory is used to describe the
beam, while Biot’s theory[6] is adopted to characterize the layered poroelastic soil.
Biot’s dynamic equations are solved by the Fourier transform method to establish the
general solutions of the displacements, the stresses and the pore pressure for the layered
soil. Based on the transmission and reflection matrices (TRM) method, the equivalent
stiffness of the layered porous foundation is obtained by using the continuity condition
between the beam and the layered foundation as well as the continuity conditions at
each layer interface. The solutions for the beam and the layered poroelastic foundation
are derived in the frequency-wave number domain. By means of the inverse Fourier
transform, the time domain solutions of the beam and the poroelastic soil are retrieved
from the frequency-wave number solutions. When reduced to some special cases, our
solutions agree very well with some known results.

In order to solve Biot’s governing equations, two kinds of Fourier transform are
involved: the Fourier transform with respect to time and the Fourier transform with
respect to horizontal coordinates. In this paper, the Fourier transform for time and the

3 The Model and the Equivalent Stiffness for a Beam Resting on a
Layered Poroelastic Soil
The model for an infinite beam resting on N horizontal porous layers overlying a porous
half-space subjected to a moving load with a constant velocity c is illustrated in Fig. 1.
The j-th porous layer is denoted by the symbol Mj and the bottom layer is denoted by
the symbol MN+1. The thickness of the j-th layer is hj=zj-zj-1 and zj, zj-1 denote the depth
of the upper and lower boundary of the j-th layer.

The following assumptions are made for the beam and the load: (a) The beam is an
infinite Timoshenko elastic beam with width 2a; (b) The deformation of the beam is
small; (b) Both the load and the normal stresses are uniformly distributed over the
width of the beam; (c) The contact between the beam and the foundation is smooth.

where wb(x, t) is the deflection of the beam, E the Young’s modulus of the beam, Iz the
second moment of the area of the beam cross section about its neutral axis, q(x, t) the
interaction force between the beam and the surface of the soil, F(x, t) the applied
moving load, x the horizontal coordinate along the length of the beam.
The surface load F(x, t) is a line load moving with a constant velocity c and given by
the following expression
F ( x, t ) = Fzδ ( x − ct )

(6)

where Fz is the magnitude of the force, δ(…) is the Dirac delta function.
According to the assumptions concerning the beam, the stress, ‘‘open pore’’
boundary conditions for the surface of the layered soil are as follows[7]
2aσ zz ( x, y ,0, t ) = q( x, t ) H ( a − y )
⎫
σ xz ( x, y ,0, t ) = 0, σ yz ( x, y,0, t ) = 0, p( x, y ,0, t ) = 0 ⎬⎭

(7)

where H(…) is the unit step function.
Assuming that the centerline of the beam and the surface of the foundation are
always in contact, then, the compatibility condition has the form

u z ( x, 0, 0, t ) = wb ( x, t )

(8)

To analyze the problem, the concept of the “equivalent stiffness” [2] is introduced.
According to this concept, to solve the proposed problem, the equivalent stiffness of the

1232

layered foundation has to be determined in advance. The equivalent stiffness method
allows an exact reduction of an original 3-D problem to a 1-D problem by introducing a
frequency and wave number dependent complex stiffness χ eqlayer for the layered
foundation. In order to determine the equivalent stiffness of the layered porous soil via
the TRM method, for the j-th porous layer Mj, extracting all the positive and negative

where χ eqlayer (ξ ,ω ) = 2π ∫∞−∞φ (ξ ,η , z0 ,ω )[sin(η a ) /(η a )]dη is the equivalent stiffness of the
layered foundation. As mentioned above, the equivalent stiffness of the layered
foundation is a function of the frequency ω and the wave number ξ.
Applying the two-dimensional inverse Fourier transformation on Eq.(20) and
using the property of the Dirac’s delta function in the integral, the following equation is
obtained

It also should be noted that the real ξ–axis and η–axis is free of any singularities for a
multi-layered poroelastic medium if the parameter b representing internal friction
between the solid and the pore fluid does not vanish. Thus, the infinite integration in
Eq.(20, 21) with respect to the horizontal wave number ξ and η are free of any
singularities in the path of integration. In this paper, the FFT method is adopted to
perform the inverse Fourier transformation [8]. To computer the inverse transform
accurately with the discrete Fourier transform, the integrals must be truncated
appropriately to avoid aliasing. We found that an FFT over a grid of 2048 points by
2048 and a range of -16≤ξ, η≥16 satisfied both these requirements.

4 Numerical Results and Discussions
When the material parameters for each layer are assumed the same values, then, the
layered poroelastic half space is reduced to a homogeneous poroelastic half-space. The
material parameters for the porous medium are chosen as follows: μ=2.0×107N/m2,
λ=4.0×107N/m2, ρs=2000kg/m3, f=0.3, α=0.97, Μ=2.4×108N/m2, b=1.94×106 kg/m3s,
m=1990 kg/m3. The parameters for the beam are as follows: EIz=1.28×109N/m2,
mb=7350kg/m, a=2.0m, Fz=150kN, respectively. Fig. 2 show the beam displacement
curves versus the load velocity for the load at the origin of the coordinate system. In
order to validate our method, the solutions of Jin [5] are also shown in Fig.2. From
Figure, it shows a very good agreement between our result and that of [5].

Fig. 3. The deflection of beam subject to moving load on three-layer poroelastic foundation (a)
velocity c=50m/s; (b) velocity c=90m/s

In the second example, the soil is a three layered poroelastic medium: two porous
layers and an underlying porous half space. The thicknesses of the two layers are
h1=h2=2.0m. The following three cases are calculated: A) μ1: μ2: μ3=1:5:1; B) μ1: μ2:
μ3=5:1:5; C) μ1: μ2: μ3=1:1:1, where μ3=2.0×107N/m2. The load moves along the
positive x-axis. The remaining parameters for each layer and the reference values
assume the same values as those in the first example. The load moves with velocities
c=50m/s and c=90m/s along the positive x-direction. The deflections of the beam for
the three cases are showed in Figs. 3(a-b), respectively.
It follows from Figs 3(a-b) that the occurrence of a softer middle layer inside the
layered foundation leads to a considerable increment of the vertical displacement.
Moreover, Fig. 3b indicates that the response of the layered medium also exhibits an
oscillatory nature.

5 Conclusions
The dynamic response of an infinite beam resting on a layered poroelastic
foundation subjected to moving loads is addressed in this study. The equivalent
stiffness of the layered porous foundation is derived by means of the reflection
transmission matrices (TRM) method. Since the TRM solution is free of any
mismatched exponential functions, the method can be used in the calculation of the
layered porous soil with arbitrary number of layers and arbitrary thickness. The new
method was validated by comparing present solutions with some known results. Our
calculation indicates that the response of a multi-layered foundation tends to contain
higher frequency components and exhibits larger magnitude compared with a
homogeneous one.
