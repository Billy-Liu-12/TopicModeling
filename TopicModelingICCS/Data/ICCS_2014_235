Amorim et al.

Virtual 3D worlds are interactive environ ments capable of simu lating some real world
characteristics such as gravity, topography and movement, real-t ime actions and interpersonal
communication.
The use of virtual 3D environ ments in education has been subject of several researchers such as
those by Ritzema and Harrris (Ritzema and Harris, 2008), Baldi and Lopes (Bald i and Lopes, 2012),
Ridgewell et al. (Ridgewell et al., 2011). Ho wever, there are some open questions in particular those
regarding teaching and assessment methodologies that should be used within these environments.
A pedagogical option is the theory of mult iple intelligences initially proposed by Howard
Gardner (Gardner, 1995). The merging of virtual labs technology with the theory proposed by
Gardner can result in an excellent way of supporting activities previously developed in the classroom.
During the research reported in the present paper the development of a virtual 3D laboratory
environment using the OpenSim software, called Virtual Laboratory of digital systems (Labvirsd).
In this work we comb ine 3D v irtual world technologies and Gardner's mu ltip le intelligences to
stimulate students through the use of some particular intelligences , remarkab ly those initially
proposed by Gardner, namely : the logical-mathemat ical, linguistic, spacial, bodily-kinesthetic,
interpersonal, intrapersonal, musical.
This paper is organized as follows: in section 2 there is an overview of virtual laboratories and of
learning management systems; in section 3 virtual worlds and Sloodle (the plugin used to integrate
virtual lab and Moodle) are addressed; in section 4 the theory of mu ltiple intelligences is presented
and some application examp les are visited; in section 5 the state-of-the-arte of virtual laboratories in
3D environ ments is discussed; in section 6 the v irtual laboratory develop ment process is described; in
section 7 the didatic approach implemented in the 3D environment is introduced; in section 8 some
results are presented; and in section 9 the paper is concluded with some final remarks.

1 Virtual Laboratory
Virtual laboratories are co mputer simu lation-based environments used to interactively design and
conduct controlled experiments. The results of such experiments depend on input data previously
defined by the user (Gomes and Bogosyan, 2009).
These simu lation environ ments provide a space for experimentation in wh ich there are no safety
concerns regarding real equip ments. As they can be accessed either in local workstations as at
distance through the internet they are considered remote environ ments. The functionality of virtual
labs is often improved with online lectures and step-by-step instructions to deal with the lab work
(Gomes and Bogosyan, 2009).
Access to such labs can be controlled using a Learn ing Management System (LMS). Besides
access control, an LM S can be used to monitor and register the students activities while they are
within the environ ment. A widely used LMS system is the Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic
Learning Environment (Moodle).
Moodle is a free and open source platform developed by Martin Dougiamas that enables to
monitor student progression either in classroom courses or in semipresential ones (Kumar, Gankotiya
and Dutta, 2011), (Dougiamas,2013) .

1.1 The Metaverses
3D virtual worlds or metaverses are immersion environ ments allo w the simu lation of so me real
environment features such as sound, and gravity. Some of the most well known v irtual worlds are
Second Life, Active Worlds, There and OpenSim.
OpenSim is an open source software kept by a co mmun ity of developers. It basicaly has the same
features as Second Life but it also presents some limitations as compared to Second Life (Overte

1414

A multiple intelligences theory-based 3D virtual lab environment ...

Amorim et al.

Foundation, 2013). Ho wever, being open source and not imposing limits to objects or regions
development makes it a good choice for educational purposes.
Seconf Life allows free subscription and interaction of users. Nevertheless, it restricts the
permanent objects and groups development, and many actions that have to be taken in this
environment are charged. Th is means that in so me educational situations the use of this software is
narrowed.
Anyway, OpenSim and Second Life are compatible to one another as well as both are compatible
with the co mmunicat ion protocols of other platforms. Thus, OpenSim is used by lots of univ ersities
and several large companies.
The integration of 3D virtual environ ment to Moodle is acco mplished through Simu lation Linked
Object Oriented Dynamic Learn ing (Sloodle) plugin. The goal of Sloodle is to make availab le to the
users diverse tools to enable the accomplishment of so me tasks within the virtual environment,
registering such actions in Moodle (Konstantinidis et al., 2010), (Yasar and Adiguzel, 2010).

1.2 Sloodle's Functionalities
Sloodle presents the following functionalities (Konstantinidis et al., 2010):
x

Web-intercom: Th is functionality allows the user take part in chats within the 3D
environment. The records of such chats can be viewed both in the virtual environ ment
and in Moodle server. These records are stored in Moodle's database.

x

Registration booth: This functionality allows to relate student's avatars to their
corresponding Moodle's accounts. It is required because students frequently have
different names for their accounts and their avatars what can pose some problems when
recording their activities.

x

MetaGloss: This functionality allows the students' avatars to access the glossary created
for the course in Moodle.

x

Quiz tool and 3D Drop Bo x: This functionality allows the students to execute tasks
involving the creat ion of objects in the v irtual environ ment. The objects created are then
transfered to Moodle similarly to the way a file is uploaded.

x

Multi-function Toolbar: This functionality allows the user activate the blog development
function within the virtual environment. Such blogs can be viewed both in the virtual
environment and in Moodle.

x

Presenter: This functionality allow the users to post in the virtual environment,
slideshows or videos that can be viewed or downloaded from the Moodle server.

x

QuizChair: This functionality allo ws the students to answer to mult iple choice questions
prepared in Moodle, which also stores the answers.

As Sloodle is an open source project and constantly under development, other functions are likely
to be implemented and made available later.

2 The Theory of Multiple Intelligences
The theory of multip le intelligences developed by Howard Gardner aimed at presenting a new
concept of intelligence, wh ich so far was restricted to IQ (Intelligence Quotient) tests created in 1920
by Alfred Binet (Binet, 2004).

1415

A multiple intelligences theory-based 3D virtual lab environment ...

Amorim et al.

According to Gardner intelligence is the capability to solve problems as well as to create products
that are meaningful to one or more cu ltural environ ments. Furthermore, it is a co mb ination between
genetic inheritance and environmental influences (Gardner, 1998).
Gardner suggests the existence of nine intelligences, namely : linguistic, musical, logicalmathematical, spacial, bodily-kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, naturalist, and existential
(Gardner, 1999), (Gardner, 1998).

2.1 Applications of the Theory of Multiple Intelligences
Qingsheng (Qingsheng et al., 2010), fo rmulated a mu ltimedia and network environ ment, based on
the Theory of Multiple Intelligences by developing a model called "Multimedia Intelligence Course".
The use of mult imed ia technologies provides the student an environment where the process of
knowledge construction is favored by the presence of graphics, sounds and images, and in particu lar
the use of the internet providing opportunities for students to exchange experiences (Qingsheng et al.,
2010).
The model proposed in the work presented in this paper aims at stimulating students curiosity ,
while motivating their choices emphasizing their personal pactical experiences. The main idea for the
use of mult imed ia technologies is the sharing of experiences among students, in contrast to the
traditional method in which the student is evaluated individually.
The imp lementation of the proposal developed by Qingsheng et al. (Qingsheng et al., 2010), took
place in four phases, namely: classroom teaching guided by mu ltip le intelligences ; achieve intelligent
class teaching; integration of s mart teachers and intelligent medias ; and cultivating students the
abilities of innovation and comprehensiveness.
Qingsheng et al. (Qingsheng et al., 2010) reported that during their research a package consisting
of a set of programs developed with the aim of stimulat ing multip le intelligences in students was
implemented. The software packages are: E Media Classroom Packages, Net Vis ion Packages. They
resemble other LMS like Moodle.
Qingsheng et al. (Qingsheng et al., 2010) claim that stimulat ion of mu ltiple intelligences is
performed with the aid of this software suite, but do not describe in their paper how as the tests were
conducted, nor even describe them.
Ali and Zaman (Ali and Zaman, 2008), developed a software called MI-Mathematics. The
software based on the theory of mult iple intelligences is comprised of five modules and aims to
usability evaluation of multimedia learning materials in the area of mathematics, specifically for
teaching trigonometry.
The evaluation of software is based on five parameters, namely: efficacy; learning capability;
ease of use; flexibility; and user attitude.
MI-Mathemat ics is a mult imedia courseware consisting of five modules working independently,
namely: introduction; review; processing; enrichment; and test. The goal is to motivate students to
learn mathematics using their main intelligence.
MI-Mathemat ics is a software whose modules are tutorials using three different methodologies to
accommodate three different types of intelligences , as follows: linguistic intelligence, logicalmathematical intelligence and visual spatial intelligence.
The so called MI-Mathemat ics instruction model has six elements, specifically : mult iple types of
intelligences, learning objectives, learning theories, approaches, learning strategies and interactivity.
The educational content of the MI-Mathematics software consists of five modules in each of
which student performs a knowledge and skill test that determines whether or not the module can be
used. The elements that comprise the system are : introduction, revision, explorat ion, explanation,
example and exercise.
A test of the software was conducted with 59 students fro m a secondary school in Selangor,
Malaysia. The efficacy, the ease of learning, the flexib ility of the software, the usability, and user

1416

Amorim et al.

attitude with respect to the course material were evaluated. The students were split into two groups,
respectively with 30 and 29 persons. Both groups were assigned the same set of tasks. However, the
most vivid intelligences of the students in the first group were taken into consideration, while students
of the second group took the test without having the kind of their intelligences assessed. Ali and
Zaman concluded that in this phase the results are quite similar, and no significant d ifferences were
found between the two groups.
Ease of learning — in this phase the students were evaluated based on five items: ease of
understanding, background color of the screen, ease of use, level o f acceptance of the material, and
whether the material helps to learn about trigonometry. According to the researchers all items showed
a positive average in the assessment reported by the students. Moreover, according to Ali and Zaman
on the average all students stated that the software is easy to use, is flexib le, and make the classes
more enjoyable, among other things.

3 Virtual Laboratories and Metaverse: state of the art
The development of virtual teaching aids using 3D environments has been subject of research in
many different areas of knowledge. The applicat ion of this technology allows one to create
environments such as virtual laboratories restricted to only one virtual space or even a full campus.
Guo et al. 2009 (Guo et al., 2009) developed the campus as well as the virtual labs of Jiliang
University, Ch ina. To accomplish such a task they combined the phisical campus network with the
virtual environ ment. The system uses the blended learning technique (Arbaugh and Hwang, 2013).
Blended Learning is a methodology that uses the internet to transfer most of the required knowledge
at distance, but requires classroom situations to combine resources available either in the real or in the
virtual environments. The basic idea o f the virtual campus based experiment is to co mbine virtual labs
functions with those stored in the real campus network server.
The theoretical model of the net developed by Guo et al. in a virtual environment comprises two
main parts that can be further d ivided into other five independent functional layers, similar to the OSI
(International Standards Organizat ion) reference model (Tanenbaum, 2012). The goal was to provide
the students with a virtual environment similar to the physical one in which the students could run
experiments based on the knowledge acquired in the discipline of networking.
Tarouco et al. (Tarouco et al., 2013) developed a virtual lab using OpenSim. The goal of their
software is to help teaching calculus for engineering curricula. The laboratory was developed in four
stages that begins with the choice of theoretical calcu lation for teaching methods, and goes through
the development of learning objects to the virtual environment.
Tests with Taroucos et al.'s environment were div ided into two parts. Initially the students used
the E2 D environment, which is similar to Moodle. Then the lectures developed with E2 D was
reproduced in the virtual world. According to the authors the test results were satisfactory showing the
feasibility of using this technology in teaching.
Rico et al. (Rico et al., 2012), developed an architecture comprising a set of virtual laborato ries
addressing biotechnology, chemistry, and electronics for the operation of a nuclear plant. Each lab
represents a module within the environment, and is operated according to the knowledge level of each
user.
The execution of tasks is coordinated by a "tutor guide". The "tutor guide" is characterized by a
set of instructions pre-defined by the developer of the environment. These instructions are triggered
primarily when an action to be performed requires it to run a previous action. An examp le is the
action of filling a glass with water, if the user is not with the glass in hand the tap is not opened.

1417

A multiple intelligences theory-based 3D virtual lab environment ...

Amorim et al.

Rico et al. (Rico et al., 2012) claim that the environment is easy to configure and that much of the
structure was developed using the software blender and then imported into OpenSim. Their paper does
not mention eventual application of the reported architecture.

4 Development of the Laboratory
In the development of 3D virtual environ ment are associated with information and
communicat ion technologies (ICTs) with teaching methodologies proposed by Gardner and Piajet
seeking a better assimilation content transmitted to the students within the Labvirsd.
The virtual laboratory presented in this paper is being developed using a 2 GHz dual core
Pentium computer with 2 GB of RAM, and video card NVIDIA GeForce 9500 GT.
OpenSim was configured in stand-alone mode as the 3D lab environment has been restricted to
UNESP (Sao Paulo State University) users in this phase. This restriction has been due to the fact that
during this first phase of the development process our goal has been to assess some features and the
usefulness of the environment as an educational tool within the scope of the computer science course
offered by UNESP , at Rio Preto campus.
In the fo llowing phase the access to the lab will be open to any student regularly enro lled in some
university course. In this second phase student registration is going to be made fro m a list of students
generated by UNESP 's academic management system.
The initial structure representing a space for theoretical activities is presented in Figure 1.

Figure 1 - Sloodle access tokens

Figure 2 - Classroom 1

The laboratory has 5 environ ments among wh ich there are classrooms were theoretical contents
are taught via chat with voice and text, as well as environ ments for pract ical classes and assessments.
All environments can be configured according to the profile of the activity to be performed.
The Figure 2 shows the room 1 where objects of apprenticeship called chair quiz scoreboard
vendering machine and chat are disponbilizados students. Such objects provide students develop
activities that involve the resolution of issues with content geared to digital systems, whose correct
answers can be displayed on the score board.
Students can also interact with each other and with the teacher via chat, besides having access to
available through vendering machine 3D objects.
Moodle has been configured to run Sloodle plugin. Sloodle is connected to the 3D virtual
environment through a res ource called Sloodle Controller (Nunes and Voss, 2013) linked to a course
that must be created in Moodle platform. This feature enables the features previouly described in
Section 3.
The activities init ially available in this environment are activated by the touch of the student's
avatar in the virtual object. The act ivities available in this first phase are the chat, the glossary of

1418

A multiple intelligences theory-based 3D virtual lab environment ...

Amorim et al.

terms that can be consulted by the student, the chair of tests where the student is assessed through
multiple-choice questions and Virtualab tool that will be described in Section 4.1.

4.1 Virtualab Tool
Virtualab is one of the tools used in this project. It is a module consisting of a web page, and
aiming to provide educational support to the laboratory, by making texts, images and videos available
on line. These handouts are inserted by the teacher and can be consulted by students.
The materials are made available by the teacher through an administrative area (called b lackboard)
where it is possible to create, edit or remove topics. The blackboard area has a text editor that the
teacher can use to input the class material.
With this tool, students are able to read information about all the topics covered by teachers in
regular classes. The materials can be viewed within the virtual lab through the browser installed on
the student's computer.

5 Didactic proposal
The didactic proposal of this wo rk involves teaching a discipline of digital systems,
through the implementation of activities within the virtual environ ment, to stimulate the seven
intelligences originally defined by Gardner. The content to be covered in the course will be
(Costa Neto, 2009):
x Introduction to discrete and continuous systems;
x Definition of binary digital systems;
x Binary signal representation;
x State diagrams;
x Logic operations;
x Fundamental logic gates (AND, OR, NOT ).
Given the integration of the virtual environment with Moodle platform the tasks can be
performed with the use of objects available in the 3D environ ment. When the use of such
objects is not possible, the activity can be performed within the platform.
Each intelligence is associated with the execution of one or more activ ities, so the
linguistic intelligence is stimulated by student participation in foru ms, chats as well as the
reading and interpretation of assessments exercises.
The logical-mathematical intelligence is stimulated by build ing circuits with in the virtual
environment. The construction of these objects also aims to stimulate the bodily-kinesthetic
intelligence since it requires the academic ability to properly use the mouse.
The musical intelligence is stimu lated through the use of video, voice chat and other forms
of sounds that can be imported to the environment according to the needs of each task.
The visual spatial intelligence, and the bodily-kinesthetic are also stimulated by
conducting activities that involve the creation of objects in the virtual environment, since for
performing these activities the student must have a visual perception to size and position
objects. Another factor that helps in stimulat ing such intelligence is the fact that the user has to
move around within the environ ment, which can be done in three ways: walking, running or
flying.
The interpersonal and intrapersonal intelligences are jointly stimulated by activities that
should be conducted in groups, available both in the virtual environment and in the Moodle
platform.

6 Results
The laboratory has been tested with computer science students at UNESP 's Rio Preto campus.
Students that took part in the test are enrolled between the second and eighth semesters of this course.
The trial lesson lasted approximately 30 minutes. Besides participating in some activ ities the attendees
were asked to answer a questionaire whose data is presented in Section 6.1.

6.1 Results analysis
An online questionnaire containing 6 questions divided into 2 sets, one addressing the use of the
learning environ ment and the other the ease of learning resulting fro m the use of different
technologies. The graphs in Figures 3 and 4 show the results.

Figure 3 - Result of the first set of questions

Figure 4 - Result of the second set of questions

The results displayed in Figure 3 show that the acceptance of students regarding the use of the
laboratory was mostly good, which leads us to conclude that in the case of the structural part of the
environment, loco motion and activities are generally satisfactory. Those answers indicating lower
ranking of the environ ment are due to some adjustments that are scheduled to be imp lemented in the
following phase of this research.
Figure 4 presents how easy is it to learn using the 3D environment. Students are divided over the
use of 3D environ ment for teaching, maybe this is due to the in itial phase of research where not all
pedagogical tools have been implemented in the environment.

7 Conclusions
The development of virtual laboratories in 3D virtual worlds presents itself as a resource for
teaching in engineering and computer science. At this stage of the research we sought to highlight
ways to use this technology as a teaching tool to be used for the transfer of knowledge to students of
both areas.
The activit ies developed so far, wh ich involved the process of installat ion, configuration and
development of in itial structures, as well as the use by students, were conducted without major
problems.
The collected data will be the basis for the next phase of the laboratory development. Generally
they point to a deepening of the use of the environment with activities directed to online games since
students expressed enthusiasm by the possibility of using the laboratory like a game.

Among the activities to be perfo rmed in a later phase of the project there is the imp lementation of
new tasks for the students, as well as developing more applicat ions for the Virtualab tool, in particu lar
one that allows the minimizat ion of Boolean functions using Karnaugh maps.
