Abstract
Scientiﬁc Discovery through Advanced Computing (SciDAC), a new initiative
in the Department of Energy’s Oﬃce of Science, will be described. Computational modeling and simulation are essential to all of the programs in the Oﬃce
of Science and each of the programs has identiﬁed major scientiﬁc challenges
that can only be addressed through advances in scientiﬁc computing.
Advances in computing technologies during the past decade have set the stage
for signiﬁcant advances in modeling and simulation in the coming decade. Several
computer vendors promise to increase ”peak” performance a 1000-fold in the next
ﬁve years. Our challenge is to make similar advances in the scientiﬁc codes so performance does not degrade as the number of processors increases. This translates
to increased investments in algorithms, tools, networking, system software, and
applications software. Large interdisciplinary teams of applied mathematicians,
computer scientists, and computational scientists are being formed to tackle this
daunting problem.
These teams will be supported by a Scientiﬁc Computing Hardware Infrastructure designed to meet the needs of the Oﬃce of Science’s research programs.
It will be robust-to provide a reliable source of computing resources for scientiﬁc
research; agile-to respond to innovative advances in computer technology; and
ﬂexible-to ensure that the most eﬀective and eﬃcient resources are used to solver
each class of problems.
A status of SciDAC in its initial year and view of where we would like to be
in ﬁve years will be presented.
