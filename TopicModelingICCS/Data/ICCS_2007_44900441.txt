Abstract. IEEE 802.16e Task Group has developed an IEEE 802.16
amendment supporting mobile terminals such as PDAs, phones, and laptops. The energy eﬃciency design is an important research issue for mobile terminals due to limited battery power of them. In this paper, we
study the energy eﬃciency design of IEEE 802.16e. For the purpose of
power eﬃcient operation, there are two sleep mode operations related to
normal data traﬃc in the current IEEE 802.16e speciﬁcation. We propose analytical models of the two sleep mode operations and conduct
their performance comparison in terms of the power consumption and
the frame response time.
Keywords: IEEE 802.16e, Sleep Mode.

Introduction

Broadband wireless access systems use base stations (BSs) to provide broadband
multimedia services to business or homes as an alternative to wired last-mile
access links that use ﬁber, cable, or digital subscriber lines. A promising advance
of such systems is the IEEE 802.16 standard, which provides ﬁxed-wireless access
between the subscriber station and the Internet service provider (ISP) [1,2]. The
IEEE 802.16 standardization is also expected to support quality of service (QoS)
for real time application such as voice over IP. For such QoS support, it deﬁnes
four diﬀerent scheduling services: Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS), Real-Time
Variable Rate (RT-VR), Non-Real Time Variable Rate (NRT-VR), and Best
Eﬀort (BE) services [3].
Whereas the existing IEEE 802.16 standards address ﬁxed wireless applications only, IEEE 802.16e standard [4] aims to serve the needs of ﬁxed, nomadic,

and fully mobile networks. It enhances the original standard with mobility so
that Mobile Subscribe Stations (MSSs) can move during services. It adds mobility support to the original standard so that MSSs can move while receiving
services. Mobility of MSSs leads the power consumption aware design, which is
one of the primary objectives due to limited computation power of MSSs [5].
In order to get the solution with the lowest power consumption, optimization
over all aspects of system implementation must be employed, including the algorithms, architectures, circuit design, and manufacturing technology. In this
paper, we are interested in reducing power consumption for IEEE 802.16e MSSs
in terms of MAC algorithms.
In the current IEEE 802.16e speciﬁcation, three sleep mode operations, named
Power Saving Class (PSC) 1, 2, and 3, are deﬁned for the purpose of power
eﬃcient operations. Among the three PSCs, PSC 1 and 2 are related to data
traﬃc, while PSC 3 serves for management procedure such as periodic raging.
While PSC 1 serves data traﬃc carried in NRT-VR or BE connection, PSC
2 serves UGS or RT-VR data ﬂow. In [6] and [7], the authors proposed the
novel models to investigate the energy consumption in IEEE 802.16e. However,
they evaluated only PSC 1 and did not perform any analysis about PSC 2 and
PSC 3. In this paper, we propose analytical models of PSC 2 as well as PSC 1
and conduct their performance comparison in terms of their power consumption
and frame response time. From this analytical study, we can get the features
of the sleep mode operations in detail and obtain some hints about the way to
determine right values of the system parameters used in sleep mode operation.
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we represent the current
operational rules of the two sleep mode operations, PSC 1 and 2, based on the
IEEE 802.16e speciﬁcation. In Section 3, we give an analysis about PSC 1 and
2. Section 4 conducts the performance evaluation and reveals the features of the
operations, and concluding remarks are given in Section 5.

Sleep Mode Operations in IEEE 802.16

An IEEE 802.16 MSS has two modes: wakeup mode and sleep mode. The sleep
mode is deﬁned for the purpose of power eﬃcient operations. Before entering
the sleep mode, an MSS in the wake mode sends the sleep request message to a
serving BS. After receiving the sleep response message which notiﬁes whether the
sleep request of the MSS is approved or not, the MSS can enter the sleep mode.
In the sleep response message, the following relevant parameters are included:
the start frame number for ﬁrst sleep window, the minimum sleep interval, the
maximum sleep interval, and the listening interval. The intervals are presented as
units of MAC frames. After getting approval, the MSS goes into the sleep mode,
gets sleep for an interval, and then wakes up to check whether there are frames
for it. If there are frames for the MSS, it goes to the wakeup mode. Otherwise,
the MSS is still in the sleep mode and gets sleep for another interval. The MSS
keeps performing the above procedure until it goes to the wakeup mode.

Performance Comparison of Sleep Mode Operations

443

In the ﬁrst power saving mode, PSC 1, sleep intervals are deﬁned as follows.
At the ﬁrst sleep interval, the minimum sleep interval is used. Then each sleep
interval is doubled until the maximum sleep interval is reached, and then the
sleep interval keeps the maximum sleep interval. After each sleep interval, the
MSS temporarily wakes up a short interval, called listening interval, to listen
the traﬃc indication message broadcasted from the serving BS, and the message
includes information about MSSs to whom the BS has frames waited. Furthermore, the MSS can terminate the sleep mode if there is an out-going frame,
mostly because of the user’s manual interaction.
IEEE 802.16 supports four QoS supports: UGS, RT-VR, NRT-VR, and BE.
Each scheduling service is characterized by a mandatory parameter set of QoS
parameters, which is adjusted to best describe the guarantees required by the applications that the scheduling service is designed for. UGS is designed to support
real-tme applications with strict delay requirements. UGS is free from any contention of frame transmission. The BS provides ﬁxed size data grants at periodic
intervals to the UGS ﬂows. UGS can be used for constant bit-rate (CBR) service.
RT-VR and NRT-VR ﬂows are polled through the bandwidth request polling.
RT-VR is designed to support real-time applications with less stringent delay requirements. The supported applications may generate variable-size data packets
at periodic intervals, such as MPEG video and VoIP with silence suppression.
RT-VR ﬂows is prevented from using any contention requests. While RT-VR
can be used for real-time service, NRT-VR can be used for non-real time service
such as bandwidth-intensive ﬁle transfer. The main diﬀerence between RT-VR
and NRT-VR is that NRT-VR connections are reserved a minimum amount of
bandwidth. Finally, BE is for applications with no rate or delay requirements.
PSC 1’s behavior well ﬁts the behavior of demand created by random (or
bursty) IP traﬃc, like WEB browsing. Such traﬃc typically is carried in NRTVR or BE connection. But demand created by UGS and in some cases of RT-VR
connections may have diﬀerent pattern. For UGS (and RT-VR) ﬂow, PSC 2 is
recommended to be used. PSC 2 deﬁnes the diﬀerent sleep interval from PSC 1’s
one. At the ﬁrst sleep interval, the minimum sleep interval is used. However, the
size of all subsequent sleep intervals is the same as the initial one. As a result,
the deﬁnition of sleep mode for an MSS has been extended.

Analytical Models

In this paper, we are interested in the sleep mode operation aﬀected by frames
delivered from network to MSSs. For the model of incoming traﬃc ﬂow, we use a
simple train model. A frame train is deﬁned in [8] as a burst of frames arriving from
the same source and heading to the same destination. If the spacing between two
frames exceeds some inter-train time, they are said to belong to diﬀerent trains.
For both PSC 1 and 2, we assume that the train arrival processes follow a Poisson
distribution with the same rate λ. That is, UGS (or RT-VR) traﬃc and NRT-VR
(or BE) traﬃc arrive at the same rate on the average. Accordingly, the inter-train
times follow an exponential distribution with the mean 1/λ (unit time).

Fig. 1. Sleep Mode Operations of IEEE 802.16e

We will use T1 and T2 to respectively denote the sleep mode interval of PSC
1 and 2. A sleep mode interval includes one or more sleep cycles, which are
illustrated in Fig. 1 (a) and (b). A sleep cycle includes a sleep interval and a
listening interval. It is assumed that the same listening interval L is used for
both PSC 1 and 2. Let t11 and t12 denote the initial sleep intervals of PSC 1 and
PSC 2, respectively.
Let ti1 denote the length of MSS’s i-th sleep interval in PSC 1. The maximum
sleep interval is tmax (= 2M t11 ) where M is the number of increments when the
sleep window size reaches tmax . Then, ti1 is deﬁned as follows:
ti1 =

2i−1 t11
tmax

if 1 ≤ i < M
if i ≥ M.

(1)

Similarly, let ti2 denote the length of MSS’s i-th sleep interval in PSC 2. For
every i, according to the speciﬁcation of PSC 2, it is simply deﬁned as follows:
ti2 = t12 .

(2)

In PSC 1, L is only used for sending the traﬃc indication message to MSSs and
enabling MSS synchronization with BS. So, the transmission of traﬃc arrived
during a sleep interval begins at the end of the following listening interval L.
When there is no traﬃc addressed to an MSS during a sleep interval and frames
arrive in the listening interval immediately following the sleep interval, these

Performance Comparison of Sleep Mode Operations

packets are buﬀered and the traﬃc indication message for these packets will
be notiﬁed at the next listening interval. In PSC 2, as opposite to PSC 1, the
transmission of traﬃc arrived during a sleep interval begins at the end of the
sleep interval. That is, during L, an MSS can receive (or send) any frames from
(or to) the serving BS without any exchange of notiﬁcation. Based on these
assumptions, we also deﬁne the monitor period to be the time interval when the
frames arrived at BS should be buﬀered and released after i-th sleep cycle. For
PSC 1 and PSC 2, the monitor periods are denoted by si1 and si2 , respectively.
They are given by
si1 =

t11
L + ti1

if i = 1
if i ≥ 2.

(3)

si2 = ti2 = t12 .

(4)

Let n1 denote the number of sleep cycles before an MSS goes to the wake
mode in PSC 1. In PSC 1, the current sleep mode turns to the wake mode when
a frame train arrives during a monitor period. Let ei1 denote the event that there
is the train arrival for an MSS at a BS during the monitor period i of PSC 1.
Then, we have
P r(ei1 = true) = 1 − e−λs1 .

Let n2 denote the number of sleep cycles before MSS goes to the wake mode
of PSC 2. Unlike PSC 1, PSC 2’s sleep mode can turn to the wake mode when a
frame train arrives during a listening interval or when it arrives during a monitor
period. Similarly with Equations (5)-(7), we have

Let PS and PL denote the power consumption units per a unit of time in
the sleep interval and the listening interval, respectively. Assuming P C1 denote
the power consumption during the PSC 1’s sleep mode interval. Then, assuming
that E[·] stands the average function, we can get the average power consumption
E[P C1 ] as follows:

Let R1 denote the response time of a train’s ﬁrst frame in PSC 1. In our
paper, like [6], the response time represents the amount of time required for
data packets to be delivered to an MSS after they are buﬀered at a BS. Since
train arrivals follow Poisson distribution, the arrival events are random observers
[9] to the sleep intervals. Therefore, we have

The PSC 2’s last sleep cycle can ﬁnish without the full listening interval since
PSC 2 allows MSS and BS to exchange frames even during the listening interval.
For getting E[T2 ] exactly, therefore, it is required to model the last sleep cycles
minutely. Again, the last sleep cycle can end up with a sleep interval plus the one
among the following two cases: 1) no listening interval if a frame train arrives
during the last monitor period, and 2) an interval time (< L) when a frame
train arrives after the last monitor interval. In second case, for simplicity, we
just assume that the arrival time of a frame train is distributed uniformly on
the listening interval L. So, we can get the average power consumption E[P C2 ]
during the PSC 2’s sleep mode interval as follows:

E[P C2 ] =

Let R2 denote the response time of a train’s ﬁrst frame in case of PSC 2. If
the ﬁrst frame arrives when MSS is in a sleep interval, it should be buﬀered at
the serving BS until the sleep interval comes to end. Such buﬀering makes the
response time long. Otherwise (the ﬁrst frame arrives when MSS is in a listening
interval), it does not cause the response time to be extended. Therefore, we have

Performance Evaluation

In the previous work [7], the author also conducted simulation for PSC 1’s sleep
mode operation and validated his analytic results with the simulation results.
In this paper, we did not conduct a simulation for veriﬁcation of our analysis.
But, we assert that our analytical results are also reliable since our analytical
method is based on [7]’s one and we extend its research results. For our analysis,
the following default parameters are used: L = 1, tmax = 1024 (thus, M = 10),
PS = 1, and PL = 10. We also assume that two initial sleep intervals of PSC 1
and PSC 2 are set to the same value t0 (that is, t11 = t12 = t0 ).
An interesting result is shown from Fig. 2 (a). Since PSC 1 has mostly longer
sleep intervals than PSC 2, at a ﬁrst glance, it might also seem that PSC 1’s
energy eﬃciency is generally better than PSC 2’s one. However, PSC 2’s energy
eﬃciency is always better than PSC 1’s one if t0 is high (e.g., t0 = 16). Such
energy gain is furthermore almost insensitive to λ (the values of P C2 /P C1 are
distributed around 0.6 in case of t0 = 16). These are justiﬁed by the fact that
PSC 1’s listening interval is only used for sending the traﬃc indication message
to MSSs, while an MSS can exchange a frame with its serving BS during PSC
2’s listening interval. So, the last sleep cycle of PSC 2 can ﬁnish without the full
listening interval. If initial sleep interval is so long, a frame train is very likely
to arrive in the ﬁrst or second sleep cycle.
Of a practical interest is the case of t0 = 4. We can see PSC 2’s energy eﬃciency
is just similar to PSC 1’s one when t0 = 4. If λ > 0.06, it is even better than PSC
1’s one. It is because that a high λ is also likely to make a frame train arrive in the
ﬁrst or second sleep cycle. If λ is very high, therefore, a very small value of t0 (e.g.,
t0 = 1) is a not bad choice, which also guarantees a very fast frame response time.
Fig. 2 (b) also provides the comparison about the response time of a train’s
ﬁrst frame. It shows that the dependence of the response time from the values

448

Y.-H. Han, S.-G. Min, and D. Jeong

of λ is marginal if the values of t0 are small (e.g., t0 = 1 or 4). We also see
that PSC 2’s reduction of the response time is remarkably enormous with such
small values of t0 . When t0 = 4, PSC 2 achieves more than 80% of response
time reduction. When t0 = 1, the reduction is distributed even between 95%
and 99%. This result is of fundamental reason for PSC 2 to be developed for
UGS (or RT-VR) traﬃc.

Conclusions

In this paper, we studied the details of two sleep mode operations, PSC 1 and
PSC 2, presented by the recent speciﬁcation of IEEE 802.16e. We also presented
analytical models of PSC 1 and PSC 2 to compare them in terms of the two
performance metrics:The power consumption (E[P C1 ] and E[P C2 ]) and the response time of a train’s ﬁrst frame (E[R1 ] and E[R2 ]).
This paper has focused how much PSC 2 reduces the response time of a
train’s ﬁrst frame. We also studied how much it sacriﬁces the energy eﬃciency
for reducing the response time. From our analysis results, we can conclude that
the small values of t0 (e.g., t0 = 1 or 4) can make PSC 2 reduce the response
time greatly (up to 80% ∼ 99%) at not much expense of the energy eﬃciency.
Moreover, if λ is very high, very small values of t0 does not much sacriﬁce the
energy eﬃciency while preserving a very low frame response time.
