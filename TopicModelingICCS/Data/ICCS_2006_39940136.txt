Abstract. The next generation backbone networks, optical IP/MPLS
networks, enable increasingly higher volumes of information to be transported. In this network architecture, a ﬁber failure can result in a loss
of several terabits of data per second and leads to multiple failures in
the upper network layer. Thus, the ability of the network to maintain
an acceptable level of reliability has become crucial. In this paper, a dynamic cooperation between packet and wavelength switching domain is
considered in order to provide protected paths cost eﬀectively. A new
multi-layer routing scheme that incorporates recovery mechanisms in order to guarantee connectivity against any single ﬁber failure is presented.

Introduction

The use of Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) optical network technology
in core network combined with IP/Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) for
oﬀering traﬃc-engineering capabilities has been selected as a suitable choice
by many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) [1]. In particular GMPLS oﬀers the
instruments for traﬃc engineering, constraint-based routing and many other
services required by future Internet applications in this network architecture [2].
Many of these applications, like e-business critical transactions, require high
reliability and QoS guarantees from the network. However, single ﬁber failures
occur frequently causing disruptions in the service of aﬀected applications [3].
Moreover, a ﬁber failure can result in a loss of several terabits of data per second
and leads to multiple failures in the upper network layer at the same time.
Recovery techniques are deﬁned in order to avoid these disruptions and reduce
the failure impact. Thus, the traﬃc aﬀected by the failure is switched over from
the working path to an alternative/backup path. The selection of both working
and backup paths depends on the skill of the routing algorithm applied and the
current network state.
In this paper, we propose and analyze a multi-layer routing scheme that incorporates recovery mechanisms against single ﬁber failures. A dynamic cooperation
between packet and wavelength switching domain is taken into account in order
to provide protected paths cost eﬀectively. New metrics, such as the equipment
cost, switching granularity and resource consumption are also considered.

Recovery Considerations in Multi-layer Networks
Photonic MPLS Router: Packet Switching Capabilities

Diverse switching granularity levels exist into the optical IP/MPLS network
scenario. From coarser to ﬁner there is ﬁber, wavelength and packet switching.
The new photonic MPLS routers oﬀer packet and wavelength switching [4]. Thus,
packet Label Switch Paths (p-LSPs) are routed in the optical network through
wavelength paths, called lambda LSPs (λ-LSPs).
For a better utilization of the network resources, p-LSPs should be eﬃciently
multiplexed into λ-LSPs and then, these (λ-LSPs) should be demultiplexed
into p-LSPs at some router. This procedure of multiplexing/demultiplexing and
switching p-LSPs onto/from λ-LSPs is called traﬃc grooming [5]. The photonic
MPLS routers have the technology to implement traﬃc grooming. It consists of
a p number of Packet-Switching Capable (PSC) ports and w number of wavelengths [6]. The number of PSC indicates how many lambda LSPs can be demultiplexed into this router, whereas the number of wavelengths corresponds
to the number of wavelengths connected to the same adjacent router. Based
on these parameters, a new resource constraint is added to the network. Three
scenarios exists according to p: a) p = 0; b) 0 < p < w and c) p = w. Lets
suppose a network scenario where w is equal to 2. If the value of p is equal
to 0, then the network does not oﬀer packet switching capability at intermediate nodes. Thus, the protection should be performed either at the optical
domain and λ-LSP oriented or at the IP/MPLS domain and p-LSP using only
path protection (global). On the other hand, if 0 < p < w, then not all the
wavelengths may be demultiplexed at the intermediate nodes. In this case only
one wavelength may be demultiplexed at intermediate nodes. Therefore, not all
the p-LSP will be able to perform segment/local protection. Finally, when p
is equal to w all the protection strategies, i.e. global, segment and local, are
suitable.
2.2

Routing Algorithms in the Multi-layer Architecture

Routing algorithms can be categorized in static or dynamic depending on the
type of routing information used for computing LSPs. Static algorithms use
network information that does not change with time, meanwhile dynamic algorithms use the current state of the network. In the multi-layer dynamic case, the
λ-LSPs are set up, if necessary, whenever a new p-LSP is requested.
A ﬁrst framework for dynamic multi-layer routing was proposed by Oki [6].
Oki proposed diﬀerent policies to allocate the packet LSPs to an existing lambda
LSP. If the lambda LSP is not available then either 1) a sequence of existing
lambda LSPs with two or more hops that connects the source and destination
nodes are selected or 2) a new one-hop lambda LSP is established and selected
as the new packet LSP. The main drawback of these policies is that the network
connectivity is not guaranteed. An example is shown in Fig. 1. Lets suppose that
a new packet LSP between the nodes (1,3) is requested and a new lambda LSP
(1,2,3), i.e. the λ-LSP1 , is set up according to the routing policies presented

by Oki [6]. In this example, both policies presented by Oki give the same result. The same procedure is applied to set-up two new LSPs between the nodes
(1,5) and (3,5) obtaining the λ-LSP2 and λ-LSP3 respectively. Lets consider
that the optical ﬁber (1,2) fails. Automatically the λ-LSPs λ-LSP1 and λ-LSP2
also fail. Considering only the IP/MPLS layer, node 1 is isolated, and the connectivity is lost, whilst the network has still enough resources to recover the
failure. For instance, instead of selecting the optical ﬁbers 1-2-5 and 5-2-3 for
setting up the λ-LSP2 and λ-LSP3 respectively, the optical ﬁbers 1-4-5 and 5-6-2
should be selected. Thus, the connectivity will remain against any single ﬁber
failure.
In this paper, an on-line dynamic multi-layer routing scheme is proposed. This
scheme establishes the λ-LSPs and p-LSPs whenever a new path is requested.
Protection resources are reserved at either IP/MPLS or optical layer according
to the current network resources, resulting in eﬃcient resource consumption.

Reliable and Dynamic Multi-layer Routing
Network Deﬁnition

Let GP = (V, EP ) and GL = (V, EL ) represent the physical topology and the
logical topology respectively, where V is the set of photonic MPLS routers; EP
and EL are the set of network physical links and λ-LSPs respectively. Each router
has p input and output Packet Switching Capable (PSC) ports, where P SCi(u)
input ports and P CSo(u) output ports of node u are already not assigned to any
λ-LSP. Each physical link has w wavelengths. When a p-LSP is requested, the
proposed routing scheme considers both physical links and λ-LSPs, i.e. EP ∪ EL .
In order to univocally identify the physical link and the existing λ-LSPs that
connect node pair (i, j) the 3-tuple (i, j, k) is used. Thus, the link (i, j, k), is a
physical link if k = 0, otherwise (k > 0) it is a λ-LSP.
Each (i, j, k) λ-LSP has an associated Bijk residual bandwidth; total bandwidth reserved to protect physical link (u, v, 0); and Tijk the total shared banduv
width allocated in link (i, j, k). Note that Tijk = max(u,v,0)∈EP Sijk
. Each (i, j, k)
λ-LSP is a sequence of physical links denoted as a set Pijk and a sequence of
wavelengths assigned at each physical link denoted as Wijk .
The p-LSP request is deﬁned by (s, d, r) where (s, d) is the source and destination node pair; and r, speciﬁes the amount of bandwidth required for this

request. For each setup request, a working p-LSP (WP) has to be set-up and
a backup p-LSP (BP) must be also setup, whenever the WP has, at least, one
unprotected λ-LSP. If there are not enough resources in the network, for either
the WP or the BP for the current request, the request is rejected.
3.2

Working Lambda and Packet LSP Computation

In our proposal, a new procedure to compute the working p-LSP (WP) is presented. In this procedure the following cost parameters are taken into account:
1) the residual bandwidth of the link candidates, Bijk ; 2) the maximum number of hops H; and 3) the free packet switching ports of each router, P CSi
and P SCo. Note that the residual bandwidth of the physical links with free
wavelengths is the capacity of the wavelength. The proposed procedure called
Dynamic Multi-Layer Working Path (DMWP) algorithm computes the minhop working path based on a variation of the Dijkstra algorithm. In this case,
the number of hops coincides with the number of λ-LSPs. Thus, the consecutive sequence of physical links, that constitutes a λ-LSP, are only considered as one hop. The DMWP procedure uses the network graph composed by
the λ-LSPs and physical links, i.e., G = (V, EP ∪ EL ). This procedure ends
when it reaches the destination node or there is not any feasible path between
source and destination nodes. If a feasible path exists then the procedure may
return:
1. A sequence of existing λ-LSPs.
2. A sequence of physical links. In this case, a new λ-LSP is set up between
source and destination node.
3. A sequence of lambda LSPs, physical links and intermediate lambda paths
(unprotected λ-LSPs). In this case, new intermediate lambda paths are setup
for each consecutive sequence of physical links as shown in Fig. 2. In the
example, a new intermediate lambda path is set up with the physical links
(5,4) and (4,1).
In the Dynamic Multi-Layer Working Path algorithm, Cost(v) is a vector containing the path cost from s to v; P red(v) contains the v’s predecessor node;
and W P last(v) contains the identiﬁer k of link (u, v). Q represents the list of
adjacent vertices which are not visited yet. Function min cost(Q) returns the

element u ∈ Q with the lowest Cost(u); and adjacency(u) represents the adjacency list of vertex u in graph G.

3.3

Backup Lambda and Packet LSP Computation

Once the WP is known, the backup p-LSP (BP) is computed. Three diﬀerent
procedures could be applied depending on the WP characteristics:
1. If the WP is a sequence of existing λ-LSPs, then each λ-LSP is already
protected. In this case, the computation of the BP is not required.
2. If the WP is a new λ-LSP, and exists an available and shareable backup
λ-LSP this is used to protect the WP. Otherwise, a new backup λ-LSP is
set-up applying DMWP algorithm with G = (V, EP ). A backup λ-LSP is
shareable if the new λ-LSP does not belong to the same Shared Rink Link
Group (SRLG) [7] of the both backup λ-LSP and the λ-LSPs protected by
this backup λ-LSP.
3. If the WP is a combination of λ-LSPs and intermediate lambda paths, then a
variation of the Partial Disjoint Path (PDP) presented in [8] is used to compute the BP. The variations are the ones included to the Dijkstra algorithm
in order to consider the packet switching ports in the DMWP algorithm. The
PDP may overlap with λ-LSPs of the WP, since they are already protected,
and the nodes of the WP. Therefore, no extra resource is necessary in the

IP/MPLS domain against failure of protected λ-LSPs in the optical layer.
When the PDP overlaps the WP, more than one Segment Backup Paths
(SBP) are established. An example is shown in Fig. 3 where two WPs are
sharing the protected λ-LSP 4-5. In this example, the same PDP is used
to protect both the WPs. Two segment backup paths (SBP1 and SBP2 )
are established between the protected segment paths 3-4 and 5-6. Moreover,
the SBP bandwidth is shared since the SBP deﬁned at the IP/MPLS layer
is not activated against the failure of the λ-LSP 4-5. For more details refer
to [8]. The result of the PDP algorithm is a sequence of λ-LSPs, intermediate lambda paths and physical links. With the set of consecutive physical
links new intermediate lambda paths are created. Note that in the logical
topology λ-LSPs are protected at optical domain and intermediate lambda
paths are protected at IP/MPLS domain.
3.4

Multi-layer Routing with Protection Against Single Fiber
Failures

We propose the multi-layer routing scheme with protection against single ﬁber
failures (PASFF). PASFF computes the WP using the DMWP algorithm and
the BP according to the criteria described in Section 3.3.
In order to compare our proposal, the next two algorithms based on Oki
policies [6] are implemented:
– Policy 1 with protection (P1P). The routing policy 1 ﬁrst tries to allocate the
p-LSPs to an existing λ-LSP. If the λ-LSP is not available then a sequence
of existing λ-LSPs with two or more hops that connects the source and
destination nodes are selected. In order to protect the λ-LSPs, backup λLSPs are set up to protect the new λ-LSPs.
– Policy 2 with protection (P2P). The routing policy 2 ﬁrst tries to allocate
the p-LSPs to an existing λ-LSP. If the λ-LSP is not available then a new
one-hop λ-LSP is established and selected as the new p-LSP. The same
procedure presented in P1P is used to compute the backup λ-LSPs. Note
that protection is only applied at optical domain in both P1P and P2P.

Performance Evaluation
Network Topology and Traﬃc Request Parameters

For the simulations, the NSFNET network described in [6] was used. NSFNET
network consists of 14 nodes and 21 physical links. Each physical link is bidirectional i.e., they acted like two unidirectional physical links of the same
number of wavelengths. Each physical links has 8 wavelengths. The transmission
speed of each wavelength was set to 10 Gbps. The number of PSC ports p was
the same in each node. Requests arrived according to a Poisson distribution and
exponentially distributed holding times. The required p-LSP bandwidth was set
to 500Mbps. When an existing λ-LSP, intermediate lambda path or backup λLSP didn’t accommodate any p-LSP, then it was disconnected. Ten independent
trials were performed over a window of 10.000 requests. The maximum hop
number H was set to 2.
4.2

Simulation Results

Figure 4a shows the performance of the proposed algorithm PASFF compared
to P1P and P2P in terms of request rejection ratio. All the analyzed algorithms
present a sharply decrease of the request rejection ratio as the p factor increases.
However, PASFF shows around a 4% of rejected requests. PASFF performs 3
times better than P1P and 4 times than the P2P. This is because, as expected,
PASFF is able to ﬁnd a feasible working and backup p-LSP for most of the p-LSP
requests, due to the application of protection at IP/MPLS. So, PASFF provides
a better ﬁlling of the capacity. PASFF protects the intermediate lambda paths
at IP/MPLS layer, whilst, the λ-LSPs are optically protected.
Next two simulated results show the percentage of the network protected at
optical and IP/MPLS domain. This is evaluated using two parameters: 1) the
rate of backup λ-LSPs respect to the number of logical links (lambda LSPs
and lambda paths) shown in Fig. 4b and 2) the rate of spare capacity, i.e. the
percentage of bandwidth used as a BP with respect to the bandwidth used as a
WP shown at MPLSin Fig. 4c.
In Fig. 4b, P1P and P2P present similar behavior throughout the experiment.
Note that protection is applied at optical domain for P1P and P2P algorithm.
This means that mostly each λ-LSP has its own backup λ-LSP if not shareable.
Therefore, the rate is close to 100% for these algorithms. On the other hand,
for our proposed algorithm PASFF the number of backup λ-LSP is much more
smaller as shown in Fig. 4b since some logical links are protected at IP/MPLS
domain.
Finally Fig. 4c shows the percentage of BP bandwidth used at IP/MPLS
domain respect to the bandwidth used as a WP. As the number of PSC, p,
increases the amount of bandwidth used to recovery the traﬃc at IP/MPLS
layer increases for PASFF. Moreover, this rate slightly decreases as well as the
request rejection ratio, since more resources can be shared. On the other hand,
this value is 0 for P1P and P2P since these algorithms only use protection at
optical domain.

Conclusions

In this paper a novel dynamic multi-layer routing scheme was introduced for optical IP/MPLS networks. The proposed scheme incorporated protection mechanisms in order to guarantee connectivity against any single ﬁber failure. As a
novelty this scheme takes into account both wavelength and packet switching
capabilities in order to provide protected packet LSPs cost eﬀectively. Thus, optical protection and IP/MPLS protection mechanisms are combined. Two kinds
of lambda paths were deﬁned: the lambda LSPs that are protected at optical
domain and the intermediate lambda paths that are protected at IP/MPLS domain. Shared resources and shared risk link group were also considered in the
proposed scheme. Results showed the eﬃciency of the proposed scheme in terms
of resources used to protect the network and the request rejection ratio in different multi-layer network scenarios.
