Abstract
We report a ﬁrst-principles computational method to describe many-electron dynamics in crystalline solids. The
method is based on the time-dependent density functional theory, solving the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation in
real time and real space. The calculation is eﬃciently parallelized by distributing computations of diﬀerent k-points
among processors. To illustrate the usefulness of the method and eﬃciency of the parallel computation, we show
calculations of electron dynamics in bulk crystalline Si induced by intense, ultrashort laser pulses.
Keywords: Time-dependent density functional theory, Electron dynamics, Real-time and real-space method

1. Introduction
Density functional theory (DFT) has been quite successful to describe electronic structures of atoms, molecules,
and solids, and has been a very popular computational tool in physics and chemistry. However, its application is
principally limited to the ground state of many-electron systems. To extend the applicable ﬁeld of DFT to excitations
and dynamics, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) has been developed [1]. The TDDFT has been
quite successful, especially in describing electronic excitations and photoabsorption cross sections of molecules [2, 3,
4, 5].
We have been developing a real-time and real-space computational method to solve the time-dependent KohnSham (TDKS) equation [3, 5, 6], the basic equation of TDDFT. The real-time and real-space computational method
was originally developed in nuclear physics in 1970’s, to describe low energy nucleus-nucleus collision [7, 8]. In
1990’s, we applied the method to electron dynamics with the ﬁrst-principles density functional Hamiltonian for electrons [6]. The method is now widely used and is successful in both linear response regime and nonlinear dynamics.
In the linear response regime, the method works eﬃciently to calculate photoabsorption spectra of large molecules
and clusters for a wide frequency region [3, 4, 5, 9, 10]. In the nonlinear regime, the real-time electron dynamics
simulation is recognized a promising computational tool in the ﬁeld of intense and ultrashort laser pulses [11, 12].
In this paper, we describe our recent progress of the real-time and real-space density functional method to describe electron dynamics in bulk crystalline solids. This formalism was ﬁrst proposed by us to calculate the dielectric

function of bulk materials by the time-dependent method [9]. It was then applied to phenomena in nonlinear regime
induced by intense and ultrashort laser pulses, including coherent phonon generation [12] and optical dielectric breakdown [11]. In the following, we present the formalism and discuss numerical aspects of the method including efﬁciency of the parallel computation. Then we show application to bulk crystalline Si to illustrate how the present
method works in real systems.
2. Formalism
Since wavelength of the light relevant to valence electron motion is much longer than the size of unit cell, we are
interested in a case of long wavelength limit where electric ﬁeld may be treated as a time-dependent, spatially uniform
ﬁeld. The electric ﬁeld in the crystalline system is expressed by two terms. One is the spatially uniform electric
ﬁeld which is represented by a spatially uniform vector potential A(t). The other is a scalar potential φ(r, t) which is
assumed to be periodic in the unit cell
The equations of motion are derived from the following Lagrangian [12].

As for the energy functional E xc , we employ the same energy functional as that for the ground state in the dynamical calculations. This is called the adiabatic approximation. In the calculations presented below, we employ a simple
local density approximation [13]. We treat four valence electrons of Silicon explicitly and use the Troullier-Martins
pseudopotential [14] with a separable approximation [15]

We need to introduce an external laser ﬁeld in the above equations. We achieve it by expressing the vector potential
A(t) as a sum of the external ﬁeld Aext (t) and the induced ﬁeld Aind (t) with A(t) = Aext (t) + Aind (t) and treat Aind (t) as
dynamic. The equation for A becomes

for 0 < t < T p and zero otherwise. We will employ laser pulses of peak intensity, I = 1012 W/cm2 and pulse duration
T p = 16 fs in the calculations shown below. The laser pulse is directed on a [100] Si surface at normal incidence with
a linear polarization oriented along the [011] axis.
3. Computational aspects
3.1. Numerical methods
We solve the coupled equations of TDKS (2) and the equation for macroscopic vector potential (6) by the real-time
and real-space method. Since the Hamiltonian in the time-dependent Kohn-Sham equation (2) is periodic in space at
each time, one may introduce time-dependent Bloch orbitals unk (r, t),
ψi (r, t) = eikr unk (r, t),

(8)

where k denotes crystalline momentum.
We represent Bloch orbitals unk (r, t) on a Cartesian lattice of coordinates r. To apply kinetic energy operator to
Kohn-Sham orbitals, ﬁrst and second order derivatives of the Kohn-Sham orbitals are needed. We evaluate them by
ﬁnite diﬀerence formulas. To obtain high accuracy with moderately course grid spacing, it is important to employ
high-order ﬁnite-diﬀerence formula [16, 17]. We employ nine-points formula for both ﬁrst and second derivatives.
We take a geometry of simple cubic unit cell which contains eight Si atoms with lattice constant a = 10.26 a.u. The
unit cell is discretized on a 163 Cartesian grid.
The crystalline momentum is also discretized on a Cartesian lattice. We ﬁnd it necessary to employ rather ﬁne grid
to obtain convergent result. This is because electronic excitations induced by a laser pulse occur at speciﬁc momentum
regions. In Fig. 1, we show the convergence behavior of the calculation with respect to the number of k-points adopted
in the calculation. In this calculation, a laser pulse of maximum intensity I = 1012 W/cm2 and a central frequency
of ω = 4.0 eV is adopted. In the left panel, excitation energy per unit cell is shown as a function of time. The
ﬁgure shows that 323 k−points are required to obtain fully convergent result. In the right panel, the total electric ﬁeld
which is a sum of the external and the induced electric ﬁelds, Etot (t) = Eext (t) + Eind (t) = −(d/dt)(Aext (t) + Aind (t)), is
shown. The ﬁgure shows that the convergence of the total electric ﬁeld with respect to k-points is rather slow. There
is still seen a small diﬀerence between 323 and 403 k-points, although the electronic excitation energy converges at
323 k-points as shown in the left panel.
The time propagation of the Kohn-Sham orbitals is carried out by the Taylor expansion method [6, 7]. For a
suﬃciently small time step Δt, we may ignore the change of the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian during t ∼ t + Δt. Then the
time evolution for this duration may be described as
unk (r, t + Δt) = exp[−ihk (t)Δt]unk (r, t),

(9)

where hk (t) is the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian for Bloch wave function with momentum k. We expand the time evolution
operator in Taylor series,

Figure 1: Convergence with respect to k−points are shown for (a) excitation energy per unit cell and (b) total electric ﬁeld, as a function of time. The
calculation is achieved for bulk crystalline Silicon under irradiation of the laser pulse of Eq. (1) with ω = 4.0 eV, T p = 16 fs, and the maximum
intensity of the external ﬁeld of I = 1012 W/cm2 .

Stable time evolution is feasible for a suﬃciently small Δt if one employs kmax ≥ 3. We adopt kmax = 4 and the time
step of Δt = 0.08 a.u.
We need to evolve the vector potential Aind (t) simultaneously. We employ a simple 3-point diﬀerence formula for
it.

where the current of electrons je (t) is evaluated from the Kohn-Sham orbitals ψi (r, t).
Electronic and ionic motions of our interest occur in a time scale of a few tens of femtosecond. For a dielectrics
with a band gap, the period of electronic excitation across the band gap is inversely proportional to the gap energy
ΔE, the period is roughly estimated as ΔT 2π /ΔE. For ΔE ∼ 2.4 eV which corresponds to the direct band gap
energy of bulk Si in the LDA calculation, ΔT 1.7 fs. A typical period of an optical phonon, which may be excited
by an ultrashort laser pulse and is known as the coherent phonon generation, is also a few tens of femtosecond. We
thus need to achieve time evolution up to a few tens of femtosecond to investigate physical processes. We typically
achieve calculation of NT = 25, 000 time steps which amounts to 40 fs with a time step of Δt = 0.08 a.u.
3.2. Computational eﬃciency
Our calculations are carried out in two steps. We ﬁrst construct the ground state solving the static Kohn-Sham
equation. This is a standard band-structure calculation in DFT. We then calculate the time evolution. Regarding the
computational time, the former part of the calculation is much smaller than the latter. The ground state calculation
occupies only a few percent of the total computational time.
To evolve the orbitals for NT steps, we need to apply the the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian hk on orbital wave functions
for NT kmax times. This is the most time consuming part of the present calculation. Fortunately, this part of the computation is parallelized eﬃciently with MPI by distributing computations of k-points into diﬀerent processors. After
updating the orbital wave functions, we need to calculate density ne (r, t) = nk |unk (r, t)|2 and the Coulomb potential
associated with the density. In this step, a sum over all k-points needs to be calculated and requires communications
among all processors. However, the cost for this part is rather small for both computation and communication, in
comparison with applying the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian on orbitals.
We show in Table 2 the wall-clock time and the parallel eﬃciency relative to 2 cores case as a function of the
number of cores employed in the calculation. The data is taken for 1,000 time steps of the time evolution calculation
with a spatial grid points of 183 and the number of k-points 8 × 16 × 16. Since the number of k-points is integer
multiple of the number of cores employed, the computational load is equally distributed among cores. The calculation
is achieved at T2K-Tsukuba in which each node is composed of four quad-core AMD Opteron processors of 2.3 GHz.
The code is written in ﬂat MPI and is compiled with Intel compiler. As seen from Table 2, the parallel eﬃciency is
quite high, more than 90% even with 512 cores.
We next show the eﬀective performance of our calculation in comparison with a theoretical peak performance of
the processors. As mentioned above, the most time-consuming part of our calculation is applying the Kohn-Sham

Hamiltonian on orbitals. The next time-consuming part in the time evolution calculation is the evaluation of electron
current. We show in Fig. scaling the eﬀective performance of two subroutines, hpsi which applies the Kohn-Sham
Hamiltonian on orbitals and current which computes the electron current of the orbitals, as well as total eﬀective
performance as the ratio to the theoretical peak performance. The data is taken from a mixture of the ground state
and the time evolution calculations, with 50 and 500 iterations, respectively. The calculation here is done at the
PRIMERGY BX900, Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Each node of BX900 is composed of two processors of quadcore Xeon X5570. The theoretical peak performance of the core is 11.72Gﬂops. Fujitsu compiler is used.
As seen from Fig. 2, the eﬀective performance is about 20% level, almost irrespective of the number of the
employed cores up to 1,024 cores. We observe a slight decrease of the total eﬀective performance as the number of
core increases, although the decrease of the eﬀective performance of hpsi, which is the most time consuming part, is
much smaller. This may originate from a part of our calculation which cannot be achieved in parallel. As mentioned
above, after updating the orbital wave functions, we need to calculate density and the Coulomb potential associated
with the density. In calculating the density, sum over all k-points is necessary. It also accompanies a communication
among all the cores. Although the cost for this part is rather small for both computation and communication, it may
cause decrease of the eﬃciency after parallelizing with hundreds of cores.

Figure 3: Several physical quantities which illustrate electron dynamics in bulk crystalline Silicon induced by an intense and ultrashort laser pulse.
Two cases in which the laser pulses of central frequency lower than the direct band gap (2.25 eV) and higher than that (2.75 eV). are shown in left
panels (a)-(c) and in right panels (d)-(f), respectively. External and induced electric ﬁelds are shown in (a) and (d). Excitation energy is shown in
(b) and (e), and the force acting on an ion is shown in (c) and (f), as functions of time.

4. Electron dynamics in bulk Si
To illustrate applications of the present methodology, we show the electron dynamics in bulk crystalline Silicon
induced by an intense and ultrashort laser pulse. The electron dynamics induced by laser pulse depends crucially on
the laser frequency, whether it is above or below the direct band gap, as shown below. In our LDA calculation, the
direct band gap of bulk Si is 2.4 eV. A detailed discussion on electron-phonon dynamics in bulk Si is also given in
Ref. [12].
We show in Fig. 3 the time evolution of various quantities for two central laser frequencies, ω = 2.25 eV in the
left-hand panels (a)-(c) and ω = 2.75 eV in the right-hand panels (d)-(f). The pulse length and the intensity is chosen
to be the same, T p = 16 fs and the maximum intensity of I = 1012 W/cm2 . The polarization of the laser electric ﬁeld
is set parallel to [110] direction which coincides with the Raman active direction. In the present calculation, atomic
positions are kept ﬁxed at the exact diamond structure.
The top panels (a) and (d) shows the electric ﬁelds of external laser pulse and the sum of the external and induced
ﬁelds. The total ﬁeld is much smaller than the external ﬁeld for both cases. In the panel (a), the total ﬁeld multiplied
by a factor of 23 is shown. In the panel (d), the total ﬁeld multiplied by a factor of 34 is shown. These multiplicative numbers coincide approximately with absolute values of dielectric constant of respective frequencies. This fact
indicates that the dielectric screening eﬀect is included in the present calculation. We note that the formalism was
originally developed for real-time calculation of dielectric function [9].
In the middle panels, (b) and (e), we show the excitation energy per unit cell. When the laser frequency is below
the direct band gap (panel (b)), the excitation is only appreciable during the irradiation of the laser pulse, indicating
that the excitation is virtual. When the laser frequency is above the direct band gap (panel (e)), the excitation continues
after the laser pulse ends, indicating that the excitation is real.
In the bottom panels, (c) and (f), we show the force acting on ions. There are two inequivalent atoms in the
diamond structure, the atom at origin, (0, 0, 0), and the atom at (1/4, 1/4, 1/4)a. We take direction of the polarization
of the laser electric ﬁeld parallel to the Raman active [110] direction, and the force acting on ions is found to be only
present along [001] direction after averaging over a period of optical phonon. The direction of the force is opposite
between two inequivalent atoms. Thus the force shown in (c) and (f) is considered to be responsible for the generation
of coherent optical phonon which has been actively investigated in pump-probe measurements [18, 19, 20, 21, 22].
The behavior of the force is similar to the excitation energy. In (c) where laser frequency is below the direct
band gap, the force appears only during the irradiation of the laser pulse, while in (f) where laser frequency is above
the direct band gap, the force acts during and after the irradiation of the laser pulse. This indicates the change of the
mechanism of the coherent phonon generation, as discussed in [12]. Namely, for laser frequency below the direct band
gap, the phonon is generated by the impulsive mechanism, while above the direct band gap, the phonon is generated
by the displacive mechanism. Such behavior has been discussed in the literature, both in measurements [20, 21, 22]

Figure 4: Electron density of bulk Si in [011] × [100] plane. Panel (e) shows the ground state density. Panels (a) and (b) show a change of electron
density from that in the ground state when the external laser pulse of frequency ω = 2.25 eV is irradiated. Panels (c) and (d) show a change of
electron density when the external laser pulse of frequency ω = 2.75 eV is irradiated. Panels (a) and (c) are at the time when the laser electric
ﬁeld is maximum, while panels (b) and (d) are at the time long after the external laser pulse ended.

and in semi-phenomenological model analyses [21, 23, 24].
Figure 4 shows the time evolution of the electron density. All the panels show the electron density in the [011] ×
[110] plane. In (e), the electron density distribution in the ground state is shown. It is seen that electrons localize in
the bond region connecting two Si atoms. Panels (a)-(d) show the change of electron density from the ground state.
The red region indicates increase of the electron density while the blue region indicates decrease.
The panels (a) and (b) show the change of electron density from that in the ground state when the laser of frequency
2.25 eV, below the direct band gap, is irradiated: (a) at t = 7.9 fs where the intensity of the external laser ﬁeld is
maximum and (b) at t = 19.4 fs where the external laser ﬁeld has already ended. As seen from the panel (a), a change
of electron density is seen in the bond region. Both increase and decrease of the electron density is seen in a single
bond region. This indicates that the laser electric ﬁeld induces polarization of the localized bond electrons which
causes screening of the external electric ﬁeld. When the laser pulse ended, no change of electron density is seen in the
panel (b). This is consistent with panel (b) and (c) of Fig. 3 where no excitation is seen after the laser pulse ended.
The panels (c) and (d) show the change of electron density from that in the ground state when the laser of frequency
2.75 eV, above the direct band gap, is irradiated: (c) at t = 8.1 fs where the intensity of the external laser ﬁeld
is maximum and (d) at t = 19.4 fs, where the external laser ﬁeld has already ended. In this case, we observe an

K. Yabana et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 852–859

859

excitation of electrons long after the laser pulse ended. This is consistent with panels (e) and (f) of Fig. 3 where we
ﬁnd real electronic excitations for the laser pulse above the band gap.
The panels (c) and (d) show clear diﬀerence of electronic excitations during and after the laser pulse irradiation.
The panel (c) resembles to the panel (a) and shows that laser electric ﬁeld induces virtual excitation and polarization
of the electrons in the bond region. On the other hand, the panel (d) shows that only blue region (decrease of electrons
from the ground state) is seen in the bond region. This indicates that electrons are excited from the bond to interstitial
region in the real excitation.
5. Summary
We have presented a real-time and real-space scheme to describe electron-phonon dynamics in bulk periodic
system induced by a time-dependent, spatially uniform electric ﬁeld. An eﬃcient parallelization is achieved by distributing diﬀerent k-point calculations into processors. As an illustrative example, we show calculations for bulk
crystalline Si. A drastic change of electron dynamics is seen depending on the laser frequency below or above the
direct band gap of the system. The method presented here has also been applied to real-time calculations of dielectric
function [9], investigation for mechanisms of coherent phonon generation [12], and description for optical dielectric
breakdown [11].
One of the future directions of the present approach will be to go beyond the uniform ﬁeld limit. The propagation
of electromagnetic ﬁeld inside dielectrics requires nonuniform description of both electric and magnetic ﬁelds. An
extension of the present approach towards description of nonuniform electromagnetic ﬁeld is now under progress.
The numerical calculation was performed on the massively parallel cluster T2K-Tsukuba, University of Tsukuba,
and the supercomputer at the Institute of Solid State Physics, University of Tokyo. Support by the Japan Grand-in-Aid
