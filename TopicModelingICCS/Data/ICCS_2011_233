Abstract
The potential energy surfaces (PESs) of Xe–NO(X23) and Xe–NO(A26+) complexes have been obtained using highly accurate
ab initio calculations. Analytical representations of these PESs were obtained using a Legendre polynomial interpolation. In the
ground state, the surfaces Ac and As show two linear wells at short distances (4.0–4.5 Å) with energies between –67 and –135
cm–1. The surface Ac, unlike that of As, presents a T-shape well at –85 cm–1. To evaluate the influence of corrections for
quadruple excitations on the topology of the Xe–NO(A26+) PES, calculations were performed with and without considering
corrections for quadruple excitations. Both surfaces present two linear wells between 4.9 and 6.8 Å but when considering
corrections for quadruple excitations the wells are more than twice as deep (–64 and –40 cm–1) as when not considering these
corrections (–25 and –20 cm–1).

Keywords: ab initio potential energy surface, Xe-NO, electronic ground ans excited states

1. Introduction
Although many experimental studies related to molecules trapped in Xe matrices and clusters are available [1–
15], little theory has been published [16–20], even with the current development of density functional theory
methods and the increasing power of computers [21,22]. In this respect, the possibility of producing interaction
potential energy surfaces (PESs) allows the performance of classical molecular dynamics simulations, which
represent a very valuable tool and most times the sole way for dealing with large systems. On the other hand, the
present pool of experimental data is still insufficient for the complete characterization of many phenomena
occurring on the atomic scale. The latter is the case for photoinduced processes consisting of cage relaxation upon

Rydberg excitation of impurities in rare gas (RG) solids [23–30], such as (NO, Hg, I2)-doped RG solids
[24,25,29,31] and H2 solids [24,27,30,32,33].
The response in these systems upon a low-n Rydberg photoexcitation of an active center is followed by an
induced intramolecular motion and consequent nuclear dynamics of the surrounding cage [34–36] with long-range
propagation of energy [36–38]. Consequently, a large blue spectral shift in absorption is observed compared with the
gas phase, which is connected to the strong short-range repulsion between the Rydberg electron and the closed shell
of the RG atoms [23,25]. This strong repulsion is responsible for configurational rearrangements of the cage species
surrounding the excited center leading to a new equilibrium configuration from which fluorescence takes place. The
large absorption–emission Stokes shifts that are observed reveal the extensive configurational changes around the
excited species. The basic mechanism is considered to be a radial expansion of the cage (the so-called electronic
“bubble” formation) [23,25,26,39] that is also operative in RG liquids and clusters [23,39,40].
In this respect, classical molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out to describe the dynamics of
structural relaxation and energy redistribution in these systems, such as the dynamics of structural relaxation in NOdoped Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe solids upon Rydberg photoexcitation of the impurity [17,41–46]. These studies have used
isotropic potentials for the NO(X23)–RG interactions from the experimental results of Thuis et al. [47] for RG = Ar,
Kr, Xe and from reference [48] for RG = Ne. However, for the NO(A 26+)–RG (RG = Ne, Kr, Xe) interactions,
several theoretical approaches have been used. To model NO(A26+)–Ne interactions in solid Ne, a Born–Mayer
potential obtained from a semiclassical projection method has been used [42,43]. In the case of modeling
NO(A26+)–Kr, Xe interactions, both Lennard-Jones and Born–Mayer potentials have been fitted to the experimental
spectroscopic data available for these systems. A common point in these studies was the use of isotropic PESs,
where the angular dependence has been neglected under certain conditions.
In references [49–51], ab initio PESs were used to study the structural dynamics of NO-doped Kr solid so that
the angular variation of potential was considered. Results for this last system showed that the curve of the isotropic
ab initio potential (first term in the expansion of the PES in Legendre polynomials) in the ground state (Kr–
NO(X23)) almost overlaps the semiempirical potential of Thuis et al. [47], showing that the anisotropy is
unimportant. However, in the case of the excited state (Kr–NO(A26+)) some differences were noticed in the
dynamics when the isotropic ab initio potential and the fitted potentials for Kr–NO(A26+) in reference [45] were
used, indicating that the anisotropy of potentials and the many-body effects play a role. In the calculation of the Kr–
NO(A26+) PES, corrections for quadruple excitations were not taken into account. However, because the
consideration of these corrections causes some changes in the topology of the PESs, changes in the dynamics would
be expected.
In this work, PESs for Xe–NO(X23) and Xe–NO(A26+) complexes calculated using ab initio calculations are
presented. The availability of these PESs allows more complete simulations of the dynamics of structural relaxation
of the NO-doped Xe system upon photoexcitation of the impurity. Results for these simulations are compared with
those obtained in reference [17], where isotropic potentials were used and to the available experimental data,
namely, the spectroscopic results for the X23 o A26+ transition of NO in rare gas solids by Chergui et al. [25].
These PESs will also be valuable for dynamic studies involving the Xe–NO triatomic system. As these simulations
use pair additivity in the potentials, an important issue is to evaluate the influence of nonadditive effects for this type
of system and the highly polarizable nature of the A state.
The outline of the paper is as follows. In section II we show the methodology for the ab initio techniques used in
the calculations and for the fitting of the analytical PES. In section III we present the results and discussion in
comparison with similar published results and finally some conclusions are drawn in section IV.
2. Methodology
The spin-restricted coupled cluster (RCCSD(T)) method [63] has been used for the calculations in the ground
12Ac (NO(A26+)–Xe) state and the complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) [52] and the multireference
singles and doubles internally contracted configuration interaction (MRCI) [53] method for the excited 2 2Ac
(NO(A26+)–Xe) state. Jacobi-coordinates were employed (r: the NO bond length, R: the distance between the center
of mass of NO and the Xe atom, D: the Jacobi angle, 0º corresponds to the linear Xe–NO and 180º to the linear Xe–
ON, respectively). In the RCCSD(T) calculations for the 1 2Ac state, r was fixed at 1.15 Å, which is the equilibrium
bond length of the X²3 state of the diatomic NO molecule. The basis set superposition error (BSSE) was corrected
using Boys and Bernardi’s counterpoise procedure in the RCCSD(T) calculations. The 1 2Ac, 12As, and 22Ac states

1137

were averaged with equal weights and r was fixed at 1.06 Å, which is the equilibrium bond length of the A²6+ state
of NO. The valence 16ac–21ac and 6as–7as orbitals, corresponding to the 3V–6V and 1S–2S orbitals of the diatomic
NO, and one 3s-Rydberg orbital (ac symmetry) were included in the active space. In the MRCI calculations, valence
18ac–20ac and 6as–7as orbitals and one 3s-Rydberg orbital were employed for the reference space. As to the basis
functions, Hirao groups VTZ to include relativistic corrections and the 3rd-order Douglas–Kroll–Hess
transformation [54,55] were used. For N and O, three s-type and three p-type diffuse functions, generated as eventempered functions, were augmented to describe a 3s-Rydberg electron for the 22Ac state (NO(A26+)–Xe). The
energies were calculated at 155 points in the range 2.5 d R d 20.0 Å and at D = 0º, 45º, 90º, 135º, 180º. All
calculations were carried out using the MOLPRO program [56]. For nonsize-extensive approaches, such as MRCI,
the application of the standard Boys–Bernardi counterpoise correction leads to meaningless results, even if standard
size-consistency Davidson’s corrections are considered. This aspect is discussed in detail in references [56–62].
To represent the two-dimensional interaction potentials for the NO(A26+)–Xe triatomic system we used an
expansion in Legendre polynomials to fit the CASSCF–MRCI ab initio data,

where fk(R) are the radial coefficients.
By making an expansion up to order N (number of ab initio points for the Rj coordinates at each Di direction) for
M values of the Jacobi angle we can write down an M u N linear system, from which the values of the coefficients
fk(R) are obtained. Taking into account that potential energy values do not change significantly with variations of the
Jacobi angle, it is reliable to use only a few terms of the expansion to fit the ab initio data. Our expansion includes
five terms (the same number of angular directions used in the ab initio calculations) so that we can solve a
compatible linear system. Radial coefficients were obtained by an interpolation using splines allowing the final
representation of the PES. All calculations were performed using Fortran code written by the authors.

3. Results and discussion
Two-dimensional contour plots of the V(R, D) surface for the NO(X23)–Xe triatomic system in the XY-plane are
presented in Figure 1. The Ac PES (panel a) presents two linear wells at 4.7 Å ( D = 0º) and 4.5 Å ( D = 180º) with
energies of –70 cm–1 and –70 cm–1, respectively; and a T-shape well at 4.0 Å (D = 95º), which is –85 cm–1 deep. The
As PES (panel b) presents only two wells at 4.17 Å ( D = 130º) and 3.81 Å (D = 79º) with energies of –90 cm–1 and –
85 cm–1, respectively. However, the average PES ((Ac + As)/2) (panel c) has only a well at 4.0 Å ( D = 83º), which is
–85 cm–1 deep. The isotropic parts of Ac, As and average PESs (when PESs are expanded in Legendre polynomials)
are shown in panel d. The results indicate that the isotropic curves for Ac and As are very similar and so is the
isotropic part for the average PESs. This fact demonstrates that the differences between the isotropic curves for Ac
and As correspond to the anisotropic terms in the series expansion.
Two-dimensional contour plots of the V(R, D) surface for the NO(A²6+)–Xe triatomic system in the XY-plane are
presented in Figure 2. The PES that includes corrections for quadruple excitations (panel a) shows only two linear
wells at 4.9 Å (D = 0º) and 6.2 Å (D = 180º) with energies of –64 cm–1 and –40 cm–1, respectively. The PES that
does not include corrections for quadruple excitations (panel b) also shows only two linear wells at 6.0 Å ( D = 0º)
and 6.8 Å (D = 180º) with energies of –25 cm–1 and –20 cm–1, respectively. The isotropic parts of the PESs in panels
a and b are shown in panel c. The results indicate that when corrections for quadruple excitations are taken into
consideration the potential is less repulsive and less energetic when compared with the case where they are not
considered. However, for distances beyond 8.0 Å both curves show isotropic behavior. The isotropic parts for the
ground (average curve) and excited state (including quadruple excitations) are shown in panel d. The gap between
the ground state and the first Rydberg state has been omitted in the picture.

fixed at r = 1.06 Å for all calculations. Panel a shows the case when corrections for the quadruple excitations are considered, and panel b when
they are not. Panel c shows the isotropic parts of PESs from panels a and b. Panel d shows the isotropic parts of the NO(X 23)–Xe PES (average
(Ac + As)/2) and the NO(A26+)–Xe PES (with quadruple excitations).

The radial coefficients in eq. 1 are shown in Figure 3 versus the distance for the ground (panel a) and excited
state (panel b). It can be seen that the isotropic term (f0) dominates the expansion for both cases. The terms f1, f3 and
f4 represent small contributions while f2 contributes appreciably. In the case of the excited state, the term f1 hardly
contributes, terms f3 and f4 contribute mildly and f 㸰 very noticeably even for the well part. The nonnegligible
contributions of higher order terms indicate that the radial contribution of the anisotropic terms should be taken into
account to properly represent the radial dependence of the potential. At the same time, it means that the higher order
terms in the series are important for the topology of the PES. For distances beyond 5.0 Å all terms converge, only
the first term remaining important.

Results for the NO(X²3)–Xe PES are shown in panel a, while results for the NO(A26+)–Xe PES including corrections for quadruple excitations
are shown in panel b.

The sums of the expansion terms up to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth terms (F0, F1, ... , F4, respectively)
are plotted in Figure 4 for D = 0º, 45º, 90º and 180º directions of the NO(A26+)–Xe PES. For D = 90º (T-shape) and

1140

Juan Carlos Castro-Palacio et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1135–1144

D = 180º (linear shape) there is a very good convergence because only two terms are necessary; however, for D = 0º
(linear) and D = 45º all five terms of the expansion should be included. In this last case convergence could be
improved if more terms were to be taken, which is equivalent to saying that more ab initio points would be needed.
Even so, we believe that this lack of total convergence will not lead to appreciable changes in the results of the
upcoming molecular dynamic simulations on NO-doped Xe solids (currently underway). The inclusion of all terms
in the expansion of the PES allows a proper representation of the short-range part of the potential, where the
Franck–Condon region for NO-doped Rydberg excitation is located, because of the importance of the angular
contributions to the potential. For distances beyond 5.0 Å, the first term is enough to represent the PES, because
there is a full coincidence of all terms (isotropic region).

Fig. 4. Coefficients (whole term) of the interaction potential versus the intermolecular distance, when expanded in Legendre polynomials. The
variables F0, F1, ... , F4 indicate the total sum up to the first, second, third, fourth and fifth term, respectively. Results are shown for the
NO(A26+)–Xe PES whose calculation included quadruple excitations.

Figure 5 shows the isotropic parts of the PESs along with the intermolecular potentials used in reference [17] to
study the structural relaxation of NO-doped Xe matrices upon photoexcitation of the impurity. In panel a, it can be
noticed that both potentials have the same asymptotic behavior because the curves overlap for short and long
distances; only in the well part is there a mismatch. In previous references [17,41] where the dynamics of NO-doped
Ar and Kr crystals has been addressed, results indicate that the well region is not relevant for the dynamics. In those
works, the authors used a Born–Mayer potential instead of a Lennard-Jones form to model the interactions in the
excited state, and the results for the dynamics were the same. Only a match of the curves in the Franck–Condon
region (repulsive barrier) need be satisfied. The Franck–Condon region is represented by a dotted line that passes
through both panels in Figure 5. The isotropic parts of the Xe–NO(A26+) PES are represented along with the
semiempirical Xe–NO(A26+) isotropic potential fitted to the spectroscopic results in reference [17] in panel b. It can

Juan Carlos Castro-Palacio et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1135–1144

1141

be noticed that the isotropic part of the PES whose calculation included corrections for quadruple excitation meets
with the reported potential in reference [17] in the Franck–Condon region while the other potential (without
corrections) meets outside, just before the dotted line. This fact is very important for simulating the experimental
results for the absorption peak and Stokes shift. The latter quantity indicates the energy released to the lattice in the
absorption–emission process.

Fig. 5. Curves for the isotropic parts of the NO(X23)–Xe (panel a) and NO(A26+)–Xe (panel b) PESs compared with semiempirical isotropic
potentials from the literature. The dotted line indicates the Franck–Condon region.

Table 1 gives a comparison among intermolecular potentials for NO–RG complexes in the ground (X23) and
excited (A26+) states. In the case of the ground state, it can be noticed that the NO(X23)–Xe PES shows some
differences when compared with the homologous PESs. This PES shows only a T-shape well at 4.1 Å ( D = 83º) with
a depth of –85 cm–1 while the rest show two linear wells. The distance of the linear wells from the NO molecule
slightly increases and the wells become deeper when the NO(X23)–Ar PES [63] is compared with the NO(X23)–Kr
PES [49] in the ground state. In the excited state, the wells are less deep and located at longer distances when

1142

Juan Carlos Castro-Palacio et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1135–1144

compared with homologous wells in the ground state. For the NO(A26+)–Ne PES [64,65], there is only a very
shallow linear well with a depth of –3.0 cm–1. However, the NO(A26+)–Kr PES [49] shows two linear wells and one
T-shape, with depths of –14 cm–1, –10 cm–1 and –9 cm–1, respectively. The NO(A26+)–Xe PES shows two linear
wells, which as expected are deeper when compared with the well depth of the remaining systems because the Xe
atom has more electrons affecting the Rydberg state.

D indicate the position of the well and E the depth. For the ground state, the average PESs are shown, and the excited states include corrections
for quadruple excitations, except for NO(A26+)–Kr PES.

4. Conclusions
PESs for Xe–NO(X23) and Xe–NO(A26+) complexes have been presented. The PESs Ac and As were calculated
for the ground state. Both Ac and As show an attractive part characterized by wells with energies ranging from –70
to –100 cm–1 and located at distances between 4 and 4.7 Å. In the excited state, two PESs are presented, namely,
with or without inclusion of corrections for quadruple excitations in the calculations. For the first case, wells are
almost twice as deep and located at slightly shorter distances relative to the second case. There is a noticeable
change in the attractive part when quadruple excitation corrections are considered. A comparison among
intermolecular potentials for NO–RG complexes in the ground (X23) and excited (A26+) states showed that the
NO(X23)–Xe PES produces some differences when compared with the tendency in the homologous PESs. In the
excited states, wells for the NO(A26+)–Xe PES are deeper (–64 and –40 cm–1) than wells for the NO(A²6+)–Ne (–
3.5 cm–1) and NO(A26+)–Kr (–13.6, –10.1 and –8.5 cm–1) PESs. The Xe–NO PESs presented in this work will allow
more complete simulations of structural relaxation of NO-doped Xe systems upon photoexcitation of the NO
impurity. These PESs are also expected to be valuable for dynamic studies involving, in general, the Xe–NO
triatomic system.
