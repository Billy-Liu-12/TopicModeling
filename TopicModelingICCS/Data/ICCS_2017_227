method (Filon, 1928; Iserles, 2004) is often used, which works reliably. It is based on building composite
quadrature formulas in which at each partial interval an interpolation polynomial of low degree is used
to approximate the amplitude f ( x) .
The Levin’s collocation method is suitable for finding the oscillatory integrals with complex
amplitude and phase functions. It consists in moving on to finding the antiderivative p( x) of the
integrand satisfying the condition
d 
(1.2)
p( x)ei g ( x)   f ( x)ei g ( x )

dx 
Knowing the a particular solution p( x) on the interval of integration (or more precisely, at the end
points of this interval), one can calculate the value of the integral of the oscillating function with the
formula

pei g  dx p(b)ei g (b)  p(a)ei g (a )


a dx 
In the collocation method the problem of calculating the integral is replaced by the “equivalent”
problem of finding the values of the function antiderivative at two points at the ends of the integration
interval [a, b] , allowing to calculate the value of the integral I  f  with the formula (1.3). Note that the
method does not use the boundary conditions for the solution of the problem (1.2), because any
particular solution allows to calculate the value of the definite integral (G.A. Evans, J.R. Webster, 1999).
Let us consider the problem of finding the antiderivative of the integrand, or, more precisely, of the
function p( x) satisfying the condition (1.2) at certain points on the interval [a, b] . Let us dwell on
spectral methods of finding the unknown function in the problem of integrating the rapidly oscillating
functions. These spectral methods use a representation of the function as an expansion in series

(1.4)



over the basis  k ( x)1 in the Hilbert space. To achieve an acceptable accuracy of the approximation
it is often necessary to use a sufficiently large number (n  1) of terms in the series. Consider the
“operator” L  p
 p  i g p and the equation L  p  ( x)  f ( x) . Its solution has to be such that with

the following estimate of the approximation error is valid (Iserles, 2004):

I  f   QL  f  
O( 1 ) - in the case where the boundary points are not included in the number of

grid nodes;

I  f   QL  f  
O( 2 ) - in the case where the boundary points are included in the number of grid

nodes.
These estimates imply very simple practical conclusion that inclusion of the boundary points in the
number of grid nodes allows to increase by an order the accuracy of the solution.
Thus, the problem of the approximate calculation of the integral (1.1) from rapidly oscillating
function can be reduced to solving the system of equations (1.6). By an appropriate choice of the
approximation points, i.e. their location within the range of integration and their number, it is possible
to improve the accuracy of the solution.

2 Approximation of a (sought antiderivative) function by the
Chebyshev polynomials. Differentiation matrix
Among many basis systems of polynomials used to approximate functions on finite intervals the
Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind have proven well for practical calculations. We assume that the
interval of integration is [a, b]  [1,1] . And we consider the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind

Tk ( x), k  0,..., n as basis functions. Suppose that we know the values of some polynomial p( x) of the
n-th degree at (n  1) points x  ( x0 ,..., xn ) . Then these values define the polynomial uniquely and
hence uniquely determine the values p( x)  dp( x) / dx of its derivatives at these points. Furthermore,
the value of the derivative at every point can be represented as a linear combination of values of the
polynomial at these points. This dependence can be written in matrix form (J.C. Mason, David C.
Handscomb, 2002-09-17) as
(1.8)
p(x)  Dp(x)
The matrix D  d k , j  is called the differentiation matrix in the physical space.
If the basis functions are the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind, and grid points are the GaussLobatto nodes


(1.9)
then the elements of antisymmetric Chebyshev differentiation matrix are calculated as follows (J.C.
Mason, David C. Handscomb, 2002-09-17):

Note. It is easy to check that the sum of the columns of the Chebyshev matrix is the zero vector,
therefore, the differentiation matrix D  d k , j  is degenerate (J.C. Mason, David C. Handscomb, 200209-17).

3 Relation between the differentiation matrices in the frequency
and physical spaces
Approximation of the function by the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind is remarkable by the
fact that it allows to easily calculate the coefficients of the function derivative in the expansion in terms
of the same polynomials. Thus, if p( x)   k 0 ak Tk ( x) , then the coefficients bk , k  0,

can be calculated using recurrent relations

initial conditions T0 ( x)  1 , T1 ( x)  x , as the solution of the simple tridiagonal system of linear
algebraic equations (Fornberg, 1996) (p.6, 162).
From the relation (1.11) one can (Fornberg, 1996) derive a formula linking these coefficients in the
“reverse” order by using the differentiation matrix B in frequency space:
Ba  b

Note. The matrix B is triangular and contains zeros on the main diagonal.
Let us write down the expression for the derivative of a function, approximated by the Chebyshev
polynomials in the physical space: p(x)  Dp(x)
Taking into account that in the frequency space the vector p(x) can be represented as
p  Ta ,

(1.13)

consists of Chebyshev polynomial with values at j-th collocation point. Then the derivative in the
frequency space is calculated in accordance with the expression
(1.14)
p  TBa .
From equations (1.8) and (1.14) it follows
TB  DT

(1.15)

and consequently B  T1DT and D  TBT1 . The relationship between matrices B and D is carried
out using elementary transformations. Therefore, we proved the following
Proposition. Both matrices B and D are degenerate (or not degenerate) simultaneously.

Suppose a diagonal matrix Λ  diag   g ( x0 ),  g ( x1 ), ,  g ( xn )  is composed of non-zero

because the matrix T is non-singular.

1003

Let us write down the equation (1.20) in the case of finding a solution in frequency space, taking
into account that D  TBT1 , and p  Ta :
(1.21)
TBa  i  ΛTa 
f .
That equation is still valid for an arbitrary set of different grid points. The transformations conducted
above are essentially the proof of the
 TB  i ΛT
Proposition. From this equation it follows that the matrix of the system (1.21) M
becomes singular only when at least one of the values g ( xk )  0 , k  0, , n , becomes zero.
The solution to this system of linear algebraic equations for the coefficients of the n-th degree
Chebyshev series a   a0 , a1 ,..., an  over the basis functions allows to determine the approximate value
of the integral using the equation (1.7).
The method of quadrature described above is well studied (J. Li, X. Wang, T. Wang, S. Xiao, 2010;
S. Olver, D. Huybrechs, 2008; Lovetskiy K.P., Sevastyanov L.A., Sevastyanov A.L., Mekeko N.M.,
2014; B. N. Khoromskij and A. Veit., 2014; Sheehan, 2009; Xiang, 2006) and works well in cases where
the phase function has no stationary points. However, in the case where the phase function has stationary
points (its derivative vanishes at the interval of integration), the system (1.21) can be degenerate and
calculating the corresponding integral becomes an ill-posed problem.
There are many different algorithms (Sheehan, 2009) (Xiang, 2006) (G.A. Evans, J.R. Webster,
1999) for solving the problem of singularity of matrix M , occurring in the presence of stationary points.
We would like to present more general and much simpler approach.
For solving this problem, various methods are proposed (J. Li, X. Wang, T. Wang, S. Xiao, 2010; S.
Olver, D. Huybrechs, 2008; Ying, 2012; Sheehan, 2009; Xiang, 2006), but their practical use is not an
easy work.

5 Regularization of numerical integration method for rapidly
oscillating functions
In order to deliberately avoid the singularity of the matrix TB  i ΛT of the system (1.21) even in
the case of stationary points, we modify the integrand, multiplying and dividing it by the same function
exp(iCx) , where C is a complex number. Then the integral (1.1) takes the form



b

a

f ( x)e iCx ei (Cx  g (x)) dx .

(1.22)

The exponential function exp(iCx) is continuous, therefore the value of the integral for such a
replacement will not change.
Introducing the notations f ( x)  f ( x)e  iCx and g ( x
) Cx   g ( x) , we get a new equation for new
unknown coefficients a , similar to the equation (1.21):

TBa  i  ΛTa 
f .
The required value of the integral (1.22) is calculated by the formula

(1.24)

Konstantin Lovetskiy et al. / Procedia Computer Science 108C (2017) 998–1007

1004	

The solution of the system (1.23) with respect to the coefficients of the solution expansion in terms
of the Chebyshev polynomials makes it easy to calculate the values p(a) and p(b) :

(1.25)

Thus, the use of the regularization method (the replacement of the integrand with the aim to solve
the initially ill-posed problem) and the transition to the solution of the modified problem of integration
allows to consistently calculate integrals of rapidly oscillating functions, including those with phase
functions having stationary points.
Choosing the constant C in (1.22) in such a way that the inequality Re(C )   g ( x) , x [a, b]
is true, allows to ensure all diagonal elements of the matrix of the linear algebraic equations system
(1.23) being nonzero, and guarantees the existence and uniqueness of the system solution.
In other words, we proved the
Regularization theorem. In case Re(C )   g ( x) the matrix M
 TB  i ΛT is nondegenerate and there exists the unique solution of the system (1.23).
Ensuring sustainability is much more difficult due to the structure of the system (1.23), in which the
elements with maximum absolute values are concentrated in the far right column of the matrix – see
formula (1.12).
However, using this regularization method allows to improve the properties of the system (taking
into account the number of approximation points), and to increase (in absolute value) the diagonal
elements by choosing constant C, thus ensuring the predominance of the leading elements on the
diagonal.
Example 1.
Let us compare the results of calculating the same integral with the phase function having stationary
points on the interval of integration in two cases: with the transformation to the canonical form (Ying,
2012) and with no conversion to a new phase function.

Here g ( x)

( x 2  x)ei

Let us consider a replacement of variables y  g ( x)  1  ( x  1)2 in order to bring the integrand to
the canonical form. The chain of transformations leads to the inverse function x 1  y 2  1 and to
the canonical form

Table 1 shows the calculated values of the real and imaginary parts of the integral (with reduction
of the phase function to the canonical form) and their deviations from the exact solution. The exact value
of the integral is known (Ying, 2012): I = -0.393011626656505 + 0.601601971947752i.

The solution does not reach an acceptable accuracy even with the series expansion of the
antiderivative in 150 Chebyshev polynomials.
Table 2 shows the results of calculating the integral by the formula (1.26). Here the accurate result
is achieved by the expansion of the desired antiderivative in only 30 Chebyshev polynomials.

This example shows that, the generally non-linear transition proposed in (Ying, 2012), from the
original variables of the integrand to the variables, which provide linearity of the phase function, does
not always produce the more accurate result.
Example 2.
Let us calculate quite simple integral





0

x 2 exp(i sin(4 x))dx with the phase function sin(4 x) , which

has 4 stationary points in the interval [0,  ] .
The exact value of the integral, calculated using the Maple CAS with an accuracy up to 20 significant
digits is: 7.9313270043818201811, - 2.2039905892931603323i. The constant C for the regularized
algorithm is selected using only one criterion: Re C   g ( x) , x [a, b] , C  (5,0i) .
Results of calculating the integral value depending on the number of grid nodes are shown in

In this case, the integral may be calculated with a given accuracy using many methods.
Information about the exact value of the integral allows to determine, in a sense, “optimal” value of the
regularization constant. We carry out such a selection by using the numerical method of minimizing the
module of deviation of the numerical solution from the exact one: this is the Nelder-Mead method.
“Optimal” selection of the real and imaginary parts of the constant C during adjustment to the
exact solution gives more interesting results. The number of interpolation polynomials can be reduced
by half keeping the same accuracy of the integral value estimation.

It is apparent that in the case where the exact value of the integral is not known, using of the
above “optimization” is unlikely. However, understanding that by choosing the regularization parameter
the number of interpolation polynomials and computation time can be drastically reduced, without
reducing the accuracy of the calculations, can be very useful.

6 Conclusion
The article describes the new regularized algorithm for computing integrals of rapidly
oscillating functions allowing effectively and accurately determine the required value in the presence of
stationary points. In the case where the phase function has stationary points (its derivative vanishes on
the interval of integration) the calculation of the corresponding integral is still a sufficiently difficult
task even for the Levin method due to the degeneracy of the resulting system of linear equations. The
basic idea of regularization, described in the article, is the simultaneous modification of the amplitude
and phase functions, which does not change the integrand, but eliminates the degeneracy of the phase
function in the interval of integration. Practically, this means a transition from calculating



b

a

f ( x)ei g (x) dx to the integration of the new integrand f ( x)e  iCx ei (Cx  g (x)) , where the constant C is

chosen from the condition C   g ( x)  0 , x [a, b] .
The numerical examples in the article show significant increase in integration accuracy when
using regularization even in the absence of the stationary points. Properties of linear algebraic system
are improved with increasing (by selecting constant C) of the diagonal elements of the matrix, providing
the predominance of the leading elements on the diagonal.
A similar approach can be extended to the integrals in infinite limits using other (non-Chebyshev
functions of the first kind) basis functions.
