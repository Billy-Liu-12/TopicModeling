Abstract. Wireless sensor networks generally have three kinds of objects:
sensor nodes, sinks, and users that send queries and receive data via the sinks.
In addition, the user and the sinks are mostly connected to each other by
infrastructure networks. The users, however, should receive the data from the
sinks through multi-hop communications between disseminating sensor nodes if
such users move into the sensor networks without infrastructure networks. To
support mobile users, previous work has studied various user mobility models.
Nevertheless, such approaches are not compatible with the existing routing
algorithms, and it is difficult for the mobile users to gather data efficiently from
sensor nodes due to their mobility. To improve the shortcomings, we propose a
view of mobility for wireless sensor networks and propose a model to support a
user mobility that is independent of sinks.
Keywords: User Mobility Support, Wireless Sensor Networks.

1 Introduction
Wireless sensor networks typically consist of three objects: user, sink, and sensor
node [1]. Firstly, a user is an object that disseminates an interest in the sensor field
and collects data about the interest from sensor nodes. Secondly, a sink is an object
that collects data. The sink receives an interest from a user and disseminates the
interest inside sensor fields. The sink receives sensing data from sensor nodes and
forwards the sensing data to the user. Lastly, a sensor node is an object that generates
data about the interest and delivers the data to a sink.
The user and the sinks are mostly connected to each other by infrastructure
networks. The users, however, should receive the data from the sinks through multihop communications between sensor nodes if such users move around the sensor
networks without infrastructure networks. Recently, applications transmitting data to
moving users inside sensor fields, such as rescue in a disaster area or maneuvers in a
war zone, have been on the rise in large-scale sensor networks [5]. (Firefighters and
soldiers are users gathering data from sensor networks.)

To support mobile users in wireless sensor network, previous work has studied
various user mobility models. But, until now, only three models supported the
mobility of users for those applications: the direct user-network communication
model, the GPS-based user-network communication model, and the topology-controlbased user-network communication model.
The direct user-network communication model (D-COM) is shown in Fig. 1. It
supports the mobility of a user on the assumption that the user communicates directly
with sinks through infrastructure networks, namely, the Internet, such as
communication systems in traditional sensor networks [1]. And, users can
communicate directly with the networks via the sinks. But, in applications such as
rescues in a disaster area or maneuvers in a war zone, circumstances without
infrastructure networks, except sensor networks, are more prevalent. Hence, the
assumption that a user and a sink can communicate directly is not entirely accurate.
The GPS-based user-network communication model (G-COM) is seen in Fig. 2.
G-COM is source-based topology [5], [6], [7]. In G-COM, sensor nodes proactively
construct a GRID system with GPS receivers. G-COM assumes that all sensor nodes
have their own GPS receivers and an ability that constructs a GRID. A sensor node,
i.e. source, with a stimulus is going to make a GRID in a sensor field. Once a GRID is
set up, mobile user floods its interests within a cell only where the user is located.
When a sensor node on a GRID receives interests, it sends interests to the source
along a GRID path and data from the source are forwarded to the user.
The topology-control-based user-network communication model (T-COM) is
seen in Fig. 3. This model supports the mobility of the user by reflecting the
movement of the user [8], [9]. In T-COM, the user and sensor nodes construct a tree
that is rooted at the user. The user always maintains the tree and gathers data.
Intuitively, G-COM and T-COM seem to be suitable for the aforementioned
applications. But, these models also have various problems. First of all, they cannot
use existing effective data collection algorithms [2], [3], [4] between a sink and sensor
nodes because of low protocol compatibility. Accordingly, such algorithms can hardly
be exploited if users in sensor networks have mobility. The other problem is that the
cost of the overhead to reorganize the network topology and reconstruct dissemination
paths is expensive. In G-COM, all sensor nodes make the topology based on location
information. Accordingly, each sensor node must have its own GPS receiver. The cost

of GPS receivers is decreasing, but the overall cost is still high. In T-COM, similarly,
user mobility causes topology reconstruction. Users in T-COM have a tree that is
rooted at each mobile user. If users move into a new location, then the root of trees
must be changed, as seen in Fig. 3. This leads to enormous overhead to sensor nodes.
Hence, this paper proposes a novel agent-based user-network communication
model (A-COM). A-COM collects data through a temporary agent and delivers the
data to mobile users. In A-COM, the user appoints a sensor node to act as an agent,
and the agent forwards interests to the sink. The sink collects data from sensor nodes
using the existing data collection algorithm in static sink sensor networks [2], [3], [4].
The collected data are finally forwarded to the user. (If there is no sink, the agent
directly disseminates interests and collects data.) A-COM has various advantages, as
can be seen in Table 1. First of all, A-COM has the compatibility with existing static
sink routing protocols without infrastructure networks. In addition, the users in ACOM do not make a topology (tree or GRID) and communicate only with agents. So,
the users are free from topology control. The user’s freedom saves energy and enables
more users to participate in this model even if the sensors have no GPS receivers.

2 Model Analysis
In our model, if a user intends to obtain data while moving, the user appoints a sensor
to act as an agent and forwards an interest to the agent. If there is one or more sink(s),
the agent forwards interests to sensor networks via sink(s). The number of sinks,
however, depends on the network policy. A network administrator might want to set a
single or more sinks in the sensor field, or alternatively the sensor field may be
hazardous as he cannot reach the field. Hence, we consider three scenarios according
to the number of sinks and describe the scenarios based on following assumptions.
• A user can communicate with static sinks only through sensors because networks
within sensor fields are infrastructure-less networks. In addition, It is possible that
multiple sinks are deployed in sensor networks and are connected to each other.
• The data which one sink collects is aggregated by the sinks. The aggregated data
is shared by every multiple static sinks through the infrastructure network.
• The interest describes how many times the sink forwards the gathered data set.

2.1 Scenario 1: Sensor Fields with Only One Sink
Dissemination of sink announcement message and user interest. In the initial stage
of the sensor network, a sink floods a sink announcement message to announce itself
inside the whole sensor field (Fig. 4). As a result of the flooding announcement
message, every sensor node knows the hop counts and next hop neighbor sensor node.
While moving inside the sensor fields, the user selects the nearest node as a first
agent, as shown in Fig. 5. The user delivers an interest to the first agent. The first
agent forwards the interest to the next hop neighbor node toward the sink. The next
hop sensor node, which has had the interest delivered to it, also forwards the interest
to the next hop neighbor node toward the sink. This process continues until the sink
receives the interest of the user. Also, a route for the interest from the sink to the user
has been established through this process. The established route vanishes from the
network when the described period in the interest is over.
Data collection. A sensor network with a static sink is a network where sensing data
from sensor nodes should be transmitted to the static sink through multi-hop
communication. So, existing routing algorithms [2], [3], [4] for a static sink can be
used (e.g., routing algorithms collecting data by periods, routing algorithms collecting
a minority event, or routing algorithms detecting a moving object.) In Fig. 6, the static
sink can forward interests from users to sensors and gather data from sensor networks
according to the existing routing protocols. If all data are gathered by routing
protocols, the static sink aggregates all data and forwards an aggregated data to the
first agent. A user may move to another place after sending an interest to the first
agent. In this case, the user selects another agent that can communicate with the first
agent. Also, the user makes a new connection between the newly selected agent and
the original agent. These agents are used for forwarding the aggregated data.
2.2 Scenario 2: Sensor Fields with Multiple Sinks
Basically, the difference between Scenario 1 and Scenario 2 is only the number of
sinks. If there are more than one sink in the sensor field, this means a separation of the
sensor fields. As a result of sink announcement message dissemination in this case, all

sensor nodes know the nearest sink according to the hop counts. Accordingly, Interest
dissemination of the user targets the nearest sink from the agent, as shown Fig 8. The
targeted sinks can be changed whenever the user wants to send its interests (see
Fig. 9). Nevertheless, Mobility support of the user and data propagation of the sink is
still the same with Scenario 1. In addition, users may not be able to recognize how
many static sinks are in the sensor fields. This means that the proposed model is
independent of the number of sinks. A user can receive the data from the nearest sink
to its position. Short hops communications between a user and a sink are possible.
This saves energy, enhances the data delivery ratio, and reduces delay.
2.3 Scenario 3: Sensor Fields with No Sink
The sensor fields without a sink are a special type of the sensor networks. If the
sensor field is hazardous as network administrator cannot reach the field (ex.
Battlefield), it may not have any sinks. Because there is no sink in the sensor field, the
sensor network cannot practice sink announcement message dissemination process for
itself. In this case, users must appoint the nearest sensor node as first agent, and the
first agent disseminates sink announcement message. As shown Fig 10 and 11, users
examine nearby sensor nodes whether there is a sink in the sensor field or not. If not,
users appoint the nearest sensor node to first agent. Once a sensor node becomes first
agent, it acts like the sink of Scenario 1. Hence, other processes such as sink
announcement message dissemination and data propagation of the sink are the same
as Scenario 1. The first agents must return to the original state after the described

750

period. This means that the first agents are appointed whenever users want to send its
interest. Then, the first agents are reactively selected and practice all process for user
mobility. In the whole network, therefore, the sensor network can remain in an idle
state in case there is no user in the sensor field. This is a positive effect because there
is no control messages and interests in the network.

3 Performance Evaluation
We evaluate the proposed model in Qualnet, a network simulator [12]. A sensor
node’s transmitting and receiving power consumption rate are 0.66W and 0.39W. The
transceiver in the simulation has a 50m radio range in an outdoor area. The sensor
network consists of 100 sensor nodes, which are randomly deployed in a 300m x
300m field. And the user which follows a random waypoint model of 10m/s speed
and 10 second pause time moves into the sensor field. The user disseminates an
interest at an interval of every 10 seconds. The simulation lasts for 500 seconds.
3.1 Impact of the Number of Static Sinks
Scenarios 1 and 2 of A-COM can be compared with the D-COM because G-COM and
T-COM have no static sink. We first study the impact of the number of sinks on ACOM’s performance. The number of sinks varies from 1, 2, 3, 4 to 5. And there is
only one user in the sensor field. In this part, we compare Scenarios 1 and 2 to DCOM regarding lifetime, delay, and delivery ratio. Fig. 12 shows the number of
interest rounds, namely, network lifetime. The number of interest rounds shows little
difference between A-COM and D-COM. This means that A-COM can manage
sensor fields as well as D-COM without infrastructure. In addition, the lifetime is
increased according to the number of sinks. This is a side effect of multiple sinks.
Sinks separate the sensor field, and besides, users only use the nearest sink to send
interests and receive replies. Users can use the shortest path to communicate with
multiple sinks. As a result of the shortest communication, the lifetime in A-COM is
enhanced according to the number of sinks. The delay is also enhanced by this side
effect of multiple sinks. A-COM basically has some delay due to multi-hop
communication between users and sinks. However, the delay is diminished according
to the number of sinks, as shown in Fig. 13. Nevertheless, the data delivery ratio of ACOM is comparable with D-COM, as shown in Fig. 14. This also proves that the
proposed model can manage sensor fields without infrastructure.
3.2 Impact of the Number of Users
The number of users only results in path increase between users and sinks. D-COM
uses direct communication between users and sinks, and A-COM uses multi-hop
communication. A-COM has more paths and consumes more energy. (e.g., five users
in A-COM consumes five times of the energy that is consumed by one user.)
However, it is a tradeoff between energy and infrastructure. Although A-COM has
more energy consumption and delays than D-COM, the merit of A-COM is
infrastructure-less communication systems.

Scenario 3 of A-COM can be compared with G-COM and T-COM because
Scenario 3 of A-COM, G-COM, and T-COM have no static sinks. There are no sinks,
and the number of users varies from 1, 2, 3, 4 to 5. In this part, we compare Scenario
3 of A-COM to G-COM and T-COM regarding lifetime, delay, and delivery ratio.
G-COM and T-COM make and change the topology proactively, but Scenario 3 of
A-COM reactively makes and shares it among users. Generally, users move about the
sensor field only and generate its interest occasionally. Hence, sensors in Scenario 3
can save considerable energy. Alternatively, sensors in G-COM and T-COM maintain
a topology continuously. Fig. 15 shows each lifetime of these sensor networks. As
shown in Fig. 15, the lifetime of T-COM is considerably low due to frequent topology
change and that of G-COM is relatively low due to GRID maintenance.
In Fig. 16, G-COM has little delay due to proactive GRID topology by the GPS
receiver. T-COM proactively creates the topology, but frequent topology changes of
T-COM delay data delivery considerably. The delay of Scenario 3, as shown in
Fig. 16, however, is only a little high due to the reactive first agent selection and
topology construction. In the case of the data delivery ratio, A-COM and G-COM in
Fig. 17 are similar except for T-COM. The reason is frequent topology change.
Topology change messages disturb the data delivery ratio.
3.3 Impact of the User Mobility
We lastly evaluate the impact of user speed on A-COM. We vary the maximum speed
of a user from 8, 10, 12, 14 to 20m/s. We assume that there is one user in the sensor
field. In this part, we compare Scenario 3 to G-COM and T-COM because D-COM is
independent of user speed. Fig. 18 shows the delay in data delivery, which slightly

752

S.-S. Kim et al.

increases as the user moves faster. The delay depends on a movement operation that is
processed by the user. The faster a user moves, the more the time is needed to
establish a connection between the user and the network. Nevertheless, the delay of
A-COM is comparable with G-COM because A-COM creates only one
communication path between the user and its first agent. The delay of T-COM, on the
other hand, is relatively higher than the others due to frequent topology changes.
And, Fig. 19 shows the data delivery ratio when the user’s moving speed changes.
The data delivery ratio of A-COM is slightly decreased according to the delay. But
the data delivery ratio remains around 0.7 - 0.9; nevertheless, the user moves faster.
Besides, the data delivery ratio of G-COM remains high because the GPS receiver
may help the user with geographical routing. On the other hand, the data delivery
ratio of T-COM is relatively lower than the others because it has too many topology
changes when moving. The results in Fig. 18 and Fig 19 mean that A-COM is fast and
stable without GPS receiver.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose a novel agent-based user-network communication model to
support the mobility of users in wireless sensor networks. In the proposed network
model, the user can receive data with a higher data delivery ratio and in a faster time
without infrastructure. We verified that the lifetime of sensor networks is prolonged
because the reactive path construction decreases the energy consumption of sensor
nodes. Also, we verified that performance of the data delivery ratio and the delay
never falls; nevertheless, communication between the user and the network for
guaranteeing movement of the user is supported by only sensor nodes.
