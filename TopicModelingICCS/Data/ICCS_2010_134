Abstract
Large and sudden changes in pitch or loudness occur statistically less frequently than gradual fluctuations, which means that
natural sounds typically exhibit 1/f spectra. Experiments conducted on human subjects showed that listeners indeed prefer 1/f
distributed melodies to melodies with faster or slower dynamics. It was recently demonstrated by using animal models, that
neurons in primary auditory cortex of anesthetized ferrets exhibit a pronounced preference to stimuli that exhibit 1/f statistics. In
the visual modality, it was shown that neurons in primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys exhibit tuning to sinusoidal gratings
featuring 1/f dynamics.
One might therefore suspect that neurons in mammalian cortex exhibit Self-Organizing Criticality. Indeed, we have found
SOC-like phenomena in neurophysiological data collected in rat primary somatosensory cortex.
In this paper we concentrated on investigation of the dynamics of cortical hypercolumn consisting of about 128 thousand
simulated neurons. The set of 128 Liquid State Machines, each consisting 1024 neurons, was simulated on a simple cluster built
of two double quad-core machines (16 cores).
PCSIM was designed as a tool for simulating artificial biological-like neural networks composed of different models of neurons
and different types of synapses. The simulator was written in C++ with a primary interface dedicated for the Python
programming language. As its authors ensure it is intended to simulate networks containing up to millions of neurons and on the
order of billions of synapses. This is achieved by distributing the network over different nodes of a computing cluster by using
Message Passing Interface.
The results obtained for Leaky Integrate-and-Fire model of neurons used for the construction of the hypercolumn and varying
density of inter-column connections will be discussed. Benchmarking results for using the PCSIM on the cluster and predictions
for grid computing will be presented to some extent. Research presented herein makes a good starting point for the simulations
of very large parts of mammalian brain cortex and in some way leading to better understanding of the functionality of human
brain.

Introduction

1.1. Frequency tuning in biological systems
Responses of auditory neurons in the midbrain of guinea pigs rapidly shift the dynamic range to track changes in
the statistics of ongoing sound-level distributions [1]. Recent reports have shown that this type of adaptation has also
been described in neurons of rat primary somatosensory cortex [2]. These results suggest that the mechanisms
underlying such adaptation to stimulus statistics might be a common operational principle of perhaps other sensory
modalities.
During the 1970s, it was shown that some aspects of natural sounds (like pitch and envelope) exhibit 1/f spectra
[3]. It is intuitionally known and strongly supported by the reports that human listeners prefer melodies where the
pitch varied according to a 1/f spectrum to melodies with faster or slower dynamics [4-5]. Recently, it was shown
that neurons in primary auditory cortex of anesthetized ferret respond with higher firing rates to stimuli that follow
1/f statistics [6]. These results suggest that the auditory system exploits the statistical features of the natural acoustic
environment to achieve an efficient representation of these stimuli.
A broad range of experiments conducted across many species [7-8] let us predict self-organising phenomena to
be found in different areas of the brain.
1.2 Self Organising Criticality
Numerical models describing a sand-pile problem are presented, i.e. in [9]. The sand pile model is a typical
example of a system exhibiting Self-Organised Criticality (SOC). The grains of sand are slowly dropped onto a
surface, forming the pile. As the pile grows, avalanches occur carrying the sand from the top to the bottom of the
pile. In the model, the slope of the pile becomes independent of the rate at which the system is driven by dropping
sand. This is so-called self-organised critical slope [9]. Grains of sand in the model are stored in columns. The
dynamics of the system is defined by a set of equations describing the effect of a one-grain addition. After a proper
number of grains have been added to the appropriate columns, a critical inclination of the sand pile occurs and this
causes disorder (avalanche) leading to relaxation of the whole system. Critical states of a system are signalled by a
power-law distribution in some observable. A frequency of an avalanche occurrence in the system is a function of its
size and can be expressed by the power law: D(S) ~ Sk, where k is always a characteristic number for a given
system. Complex systems exhibiting SOC behaviour have been widely investigated and discussed, i.e. in [9].
Earthquakes, forest fires, biological evolution are just three examples of wide range of phenomena that have been
successfully modelled this way [9].
1.3 Liquid State Machines
The brain cortex is built of neurons organised in microcircuits [10] forming columns. The function of each
column depends on its location in the brain. Because of its enormous complexity (1011 cells) the brain is hard to be
simulated, even for the most powerful super-computers. However, according to the idea given by Maass [11] whole
ensembles of microcircuits can be modelled in an effective way. Such an approach has been called the Liquid
Computing theory. Generally, a fragment of the cortex is treated in similar way that physicists treat liquids. Cortical
PLFURFLUFXLWVWXUQRXWWREH YHU\JRRG³OLTXLGV´IRUFRPSXWLQJRQDYDULety of perturbations. Characterised by the
large diversity of elements, neurons, synapses, time constants and other biologically complicated mechanisms
including interactions, microcircuit dynamics resembles complex behaviour of particles in the liquid. The state of
the neural liquid can keep at least for some time the information about its stimulation history just like the waves on
WKHODNH¶VVXUIDFHNHHSVRPHLQIRUPDWLRQDERXWthe disturbances like e.g., the wind and stones dropped into it. The
model of Liquid State Machine (LSM) originates in strict mathematical framework and guarantees, under ideal
conditions, universal computational power [11]. Applying ideas of Liquid Computing decreases the number of cells
in a constructed model. In addition the simulation time can be shortened by parallelisation.
In this paper we will show that the power law distribution of neural spike dynamics manifests itself both in some

areas of real rat brain and in the model of mammalian cortical hypercolumn consisting of 128 LSMs. We will use
the Parallel neural Circuit SIMulator (PCSIM) and present its benchmarking results for Intel Xeon Quad Core based
cluster.
2.

The Model of Cortical Hypercolumn

In the most typical run we simulated a set of 128 neural columns, each consisting of 1024 Leaky Integrate and
Fire neurons (LIF) put in 3D space on 8×8×16 grid.
80% of neurons were set to be excitatory and 20% inhibitory. The percentage of inhibitory and excitatory cells
was chosen to be similar to real area of the brain cortex. Neurons constructing each column were connected with
probability falling with EXFOLGHDQGLVWDQFHFDOFXODWHGDFFRUGLQJWRS &ÂH[S-ȜGZKHUH& Ȝ DQGGVWDQGV
for the distance between presynaptic and postsynaptic neuron ± the parameters often used in original Maass' works
[11].
In addition neurons of each column were connected with the neurons of the other columns with probability
ranging from p=0.01 to p=0.1. The rule of connecting columns was set as follows: the k-indexed column was
connected with Ns columns, indexed by n, where n>k. Typically we used Ns=3 which means that 1-st column was
connected with 2-nd, 3-rd and 4-th, the 2-nd column with columns numbered 3, 4 and 5, finally the 127-th column
with the column indexed by number 128.
A population of 30 Poisson input spiking neurons was created as well and connected with 30% neurons of the 1st column. Details of LIF and Poisson neurons are presented in Appendix A.
We simulated 1 s of the biological time of the system. Depending on the connection density and the number of
simulated neurons per core the production run ranged from several minutes to several hours.
We used PCSIM tool for all simulations. It was created for modelling artificial biological-like neural networks
composed of different models of neurons and different types of synapses. Being written in C++ it has a primary
interface designed for the Python programming language. According to [13] it has the power to simulate networks
containing up to millions of neurons and on the order of billions of synapses. Parallelisation is achieved by
distributing the network over different nodes of a computing cluster using Message Passing Interface (MPI) [14] and
Network File System (NFS) [15].

Results of Electrophysiological and Numerical Experiments

3.1. Electrophysiological results obtained from rat somatosensory cortex
Electrophysiologial data were provided by Jose Albert Garcia-Lazaro and his lab. Briefly, in their study [2] they
characterized the intensity/response functions of neurons in rat primary somatosensory cortex to sinusoidal vibration
of the whiskers with amplitudes that were changed every 40 ms. Amplitudes were selected randomly such that there
was an 80% chance for the amplitude to be drawn from a narrow high-probability region (HPR), and a 20% chance
that amplitudes would lie either above or below it. Garcia-Lazaro et al. (2007) recorded responses to 4 different
HPRs from neurons in rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1).
For each HPR, they collected responses to three different sequences and recorded 5 repeats for each 30s long
sequence. The stimulus mean and variance were manipulated by shifting or widening the high probability region.
Responses from 110 single neurons were collected in response to shifts of the HPR and from 131 neurons in
response to changes in width. See [2] for a detailed description of the stimulus design and recording methods.
The number of spiking neurons was collected in 0.01 s intervals of time. The group of neurons spiking in one,
particular interval was referred to as an avalanche.
Most often the single spiking neurons were observed. However, avalanches of spike potential with two neurons
participating in the event turned out to appear much more frequently than the relaxations of the whole investigated
system and the process followed power law distribution. That is why one should note that for the avalanches with
the number of neurons greater than 2 the SOC theory quite well describes the cortical behaviour (see. Fig. 1). This is
additional result and value for the frequency tuning research described in [2].
It was shown that certain extended dissipative dynamical systems naturally evolve into a critical state, with no

flicker noise or 1/f noise; its spatial signature is the emergence of scale-invariant (fractal) structure [9].
Generic, deterministic, nonconservative models displaying self-organized criticality were shown to exhibit 1/f
noise. The exponent of the power spectrum depends on the level of conservation [13].
The aim of the numerical research conducted for this article was to check whether similar dynamics appears in
the model consisting of LSMs, realised in PCSIM. On the other hand we wanted to investigate how effective the
parallelisation of PCSIM is. Simulations of hundreds of thousands of cells can lead to design of new, interesting
neurobiological experiments.

time. Data was collected for the primary somatosensory cortex of the real rat.

3.2 Simulations of 128 columns
Results of simulations confirmed our expectations. For a typical run we obtained very similar dynamics of the
LSM column. Self-organising behaviour manifests itself on the plots generated for particular columns, probing the
system with the same time interval. Of course for the large numbers of Ns (dense inter-column connections)
simulated neurons show the tendency for synchronisation; however, for most of the simulations the dynamics of the
system is similar to that presented in Fig. 2 and Fig.3.
The curve in Fig. 3 is more diffused than one in Fig. 2. Note, that Fig. 3 was generated for the 7-th column, whilst
the Fig. 2 presents data obtained for the column No. 1. Diffusion of the curve may originate iQ WKH V\VWHP¶V
tendency to synchronisation.
In Fig. 4 the data for the 8-th column is presented. We observe good agreement with the power law with one
exception of the last peak coming from synchronisation. In contrast ± in Fig. 5 the case with no SOC behaviour is
presented.
So we suppose that the presence of SOC depends on the density of connections, position of the column in
simulated structure and probably some intrinsic parameters of the LSM-based network.
It is interesting from the point of view of the modeller that when SOC is present ± even the inclination of the
slope tends to be similar to that taken from the real brain. Although we did not set identical cell parameters, time
constants, etc. SOC seems to be present in neural ensembles no matter the details of the cells used in simulations.

Benchmarking simulations of 128 columns

The system was simulated on simple cluster working under control of Ubuntu 8.04 OS and built of two double
quad-core machines. For detail see Appendix B.
We tested the model consisting of 128 LSMs parallelised for 16 nodes. The parallelisation is realised

independently on the user in the PCSIM simulation engine. This simplifies the process of coding of the algorithm;
however, in our opinion it should be possible to run more effective simulations.

time. Typical data obtained from 128-LSM simulation, Ns=2, p=0.02, column 7.

In Fig. 6 benchmarking results are presented. One can see that the biggest speedup is achieved after splitting the
simulation into two processors. Adding additional nodes (cores) does not seem to bring additional effects and the
simulation time stays on its value estimated for two-node level. Of course the greater the number of connections is
the longer the simulation runs. For 128 LSMs and Ns=1 the simulation times ranges from 17 to 1000 minutes.
In Fig. 7 the 3-dimensional representation of simulation time as a function of probability of inter-column
connections and number of nodes is presented. It is obvious and predictable that the more connections in the
hypercolumn is established the longer time of simulation is required.

Models consisting of 128 LSMs were simulated both on 1 and 2 machines, in the most sophisticated case on 16
cores. For the case of two machines we observed similar behaviour to simulations of 64 LSMs in the computational
space of one machine. However, after splitting the 128-LSM simulation into two computers large drop in simulation
time could be noted (best for 8 nodes on two machines). Adding additional nodes (cores) up to 16 brought no
additional effect. Two plots in Fig. 8 present the simulation time obtained for splitting the simulation into 8 nodes
for one (top line) and for two machines (bottom line). For number of nodes greater than 8 the simulation was run
only on two machines.

This implies that the mechanism of parallelisation automatically implemented in PCSIM is sensitive rather to the
number of machines or processors than the number of cores. Better benchmarking requires more complicated
analysis of cluster performance and its dependences on MPI structure. Nevertheless, even the parallelisation
implemented in PCSIM allows to run simulations on many cores with the use of MPI and NFS and it can be
recognised as a success. For the most complicated models that we investigated it is impossible to run the scripts on
one node or sometimes (for the case of dense connections) even two nodes.

Conclusions

In this paper we have shown the SOC phenomena appearing in real biological areas of rat primary somatosensory
cortex and in the model consisting of about 128 thousands of the simulated LIF cells. Benchmarking of PCSIM was
conducted as well. Its results are optimistic and let us design simulations of about 1 million of cells just on 8 double
quad-core machines (64 cores). Such a big number of neurons in the model can manifest either similar or
completely different dynamics than presented in current research. Probably this will help in better understanding of
SOC function in real brains. Simulations consisting of millions of cells are going to be conducted thanks to the
Polish Infrastructure for Supporting Computational Science ± PL.GRID project [16].
6.

Future Research

We referred the initial stage of our research. Future experiments will require more systematic analysis of SOC
manifestation in simulated systems and cortical regions of real brains. Statistical analysis of many cases including
varying Ns number and i.e., intra- and inter-column connection density for different models of neuron should be
conducted very soon. For the reported research we analysed particular LSM columns. Analysis of a whole ensemble
of the hypercolumn should be performed as well.
