Abstract. Optimal control theory is applied to obtain infrared laser
pulses for the selective vibrational excitation of a two mathematical dimensional model of carboxy-myoglobin. Density functional theory is used
to obtain the potential energy and dipole moment surfaces of the active
site model. The Conjugate gradient method is employed to optimize the
cost functional and to obtain the optimized laser pulses. Optimized laser
ﬁelds are found which give virtually 100% excitation probability to preselected vibrational levels.

Introduction

Application of control theory [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11] to biological systems is
quite diﬃcult because of their large size and complexity. The availability of
ultrafast and intense mid-IR pulses has opened the way to achieving laser control in molecules such as proteins. Hemoglobin and myoglobin are among the
most studied proteins, especially the structure and dynamics of the Fe-CO bond
have been extensively studied for several years [12,13,14,15]. The possibility of
laser control of dynamics in biological systems using frequencies in the visible
regime has been established by various groups [15]. Recently Joﬀre et al. have
demonstrated coherent vibrational climbing up to v = 6 state of C-O vibration
in carboxy-hemoglobin using mid-IR chirped ultrashort pulses [16].
Our aim is to use optimal control theory (OCT) to design laser pulses for
the selective vibrational excitation of the Fe-C-O fragment of the active site of
carboxy-myoglobin. Peirce et al. [11] introduced the concept of OCT in molecular
control, in which the problem is posed as an optimization of a cost functional. We
have applied optimal control theory for selective vibrational excitation of Fe-C
bond at the active site of carboxy-myoglobin. We have treated the interaction of
the molecule with the electric ﬁeld within the dipole approximation. As the dipole
moment of the C-O bond in the Fe-C-O fragment is much higher than that of the
Fe-C bond, so the C-O dipole will interact more strongly with the applied laser
ﬁeld and hence will absorb more energy. A reasonable physical mechanism for the

excitation of the Fe-C vibrational motion would be to ﬁrst deposit energy in the
C-O bond and then to selectively transfer this energy into the Fe-C bond. For the
theoretical design of a laser ﬁeld, we have performed optimal control calculations
on Fe-C-O portion of the optimized structure. The potential energy and dipole
moment surfaces are obtained using DFT calculations of a 60 atom model of
the active site of the system. The Fe-C and C-O separations are systematically
varied while all other internal coordinates are held ﬁxed at their values in the
equilibrium geometry. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. 2.1 we present
the details of electronic structure calculations and the description of the active
site in consideration. In Sec. 2.2 the optimal control formulation for triatomic
system (Fe-C-O) is described in detail. Sec. 2.3 describes the conjugate gradient
method, used for optimisation of the functional constructed in Sec. 2.2. In Sec.
3, the results are discussed in detail and ﬁnally in Sec. 4 we conclude with a
summary.

2.1

Theory and Method
Electronic Structure Calculations and Active Site Model

In the present study, ab initio electronic structure calculations are performed
using the Gaussian03 suite [17] of quantum chemical programmes. In order to
model the active site of carboxy-myoglobin, we chose hexa-coordinated ironporphyrin-imidazole-CO as our model structure, where the imidazole ligand is
used to mimic the eﬀect of the proximal histidine residue. Geometry optimization
of this model structure was performed using density-functional theory (DFT),
with the popular B3LYP hybrid extended-correlation functional. For iron, oxygen, nitrogen and carbon we have used the 6-311G* basis set while the 6-31G
basis was used for the hydrogen atoms. We have chosen Fe-C-O fragment to
be our control system, treating the rest of the molecule as frozen. The crystallographic studies of carboxy-myoglobin (MbCO) show an almost linear FeCO
geometry as well as a nearly perfect square planar symmetry with respect to
the nitrogen plane formed by the four pyrrole N-ligands of the heme iron [18].
Figure 1 shows that the Fe-C-O fragment in the optimized structure is almost
straight, so we have chosen the Fe-C-O fragment to be linear throughout our
optimal ﬁeld calculations. This is substantiated by the geometrical parameters
obtained from the electronic structure calculations. The variations of potential
energy and dipole moment with change in bond lengths (Fe-C, C-O) are shown
in Fig. 2.
2.2

Dynamical Evolution and Application of Optimal Control
Theory

In our control system (Fe-C-O) there are two bonds and the problem is formulated using Jacobi coordinates R and r, shown in Fig. 1(b), where the coordinate
R is the distance of iron atom from center of mass of C-O bond and r is the carbon oxygen bond length. Our aim is to design a laser pulse that can selectively

transfer population from an initial vibrational state to a desired target vibrational state at a ﬁxed time. For the design of such a laser pulse we construct a
cost functional containing our objective, a penalty term for the ﬂuence and the
dynamical constraint requiring that the time-dependent Schr¨
odinger equation
be obeyed at all times. The Grand cost functional to be optimized takes the
following form:[7,11]

J[ (t)] = | ψi (T )|φf |2 − α0
0

T

[ (t)]2 dt − 2Re

χf (t)|

∂
ˆ ( (t)) |ψi (t) dt ,
+ iH

(1)

where, the ﬁrst term contains the physical objective, the second accounts for the
penalties on pulse energy and the last term comes from the dynamical constraint.
The function ψi (t) is the initial wavefunction propagated to time t under the action of the optimal laser ﬁeld (t) and φf is the target state to be reached at the
ﬁnal time T . The function χf (t) can be regarded as a Lagrange multiplier introduced to assure satisfaction of the time-dependent Schr¨
odinger equation. The
factor α0 is a constant positive weighting parameter that speciﬁes the weight
of the pulse energy in the functional. The time evolution of the quantum state
|ψ(t) under the inﬂuence of an external ﬁeld, (t), within the dipole approximation, is governed by the time-dependent Schr¨
odinger equation (atomic units

where H

respectively (see [7] for further details).
Variation of the grand functional (Eq. (1)) with small independent changes
in the wave function, ψi (t), the Lagrange multiplier, χf (t) and the electric ﬁeld,
(t), leads to the following set of nonlinear pulse design equations for vibrational
control in Fe-C-O part of carboxy-myoglobin:

These coupled diﬀerential equations can be solved iteratively. In order to maximize our cost functional (Eq. (1)),subject to Eqs. (3) and (4) we have used the
conjugate gradient method discussed in detail in Sec. 2.3.
2.3

Conjugate Gradient Method

In order to theoretically design a laser pulse that can selectively control vibrational excitation in the iron-carbon part of carboy-myoglobin, calculations are
carried out to maximize the value of the cost functional, J, mentioned in Eq.
(1) using the conjugate gradient method [7]. After k number of iterations in the
optimization cycle, the gradient of J with respect to at time t is given by

−(t−T /2)2

In addition, a Gaussian envelope function s(t) = e (T /4)2 is preserved throughout the optimization (see [7]) to ensure that the optimized ﬁeld switches smoothly
on and oﬀ. The wave function, ψi (t), and the Lagrange multiplier, χf (t), are
propagated in time using the second order split-operator method [19]. In order
to determine the maximum value of the cost functional a line search is performed
along the Polak-Ribiere-Polyak search direction calculated using Eq. (6) as
dk (ti ) = g k (ti ) + ζ k dk−1 (ti )
where
ζk =

g k (ti )T (g k (ti ) − g k−1 (ti ))

k = 2, 3, ..., and d1 (ti ) = g 1 (ti ). To prevent the algorithm from sampling (t) values outside of the desired ﬁeld amplitude range [ min , ] during the line search,
the direction dk (t) is projected. The projected search direction is Fourier transformed to obtain a function of frequency, and this function is ﬁltered using a
20th -order Butterworth bandpass ﬁlter in order to restrict the frequency components of the electric ﬁeld within a speciﬁed range. The ﬁeld is updated using
the following expression as
k+1

(t) =

k

(t) + λ dkp (t),

(9)

where λ is determined by the line search.

Results and Discussion

We discuss now the results obtained using the optimal control formalism described above, for two vibrational excitations of the molecule. The ﬁrst excitation
is from the ground vibrational state to the vibrational state corresponding to a CO stretch (v = 0 → v = 5). The second is an excitation from ground vibrational

The Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method [20] is used to create a direct product basis for the variational calculation of the triatomic vibrational wave functions
of the (Fe-C-O) system. For the time propagation, we employed 64 grid points
for both R and r coordinates. In order to impose constraints on the total laser
ﬂuence a constant penalty parameter α0 in Eq. (1) is set to 0.1 for both the
transitions.

system (Fe-C-O) using a pulse of length 40,000 h

and s(t) is the envelope function (see above). We illustrate the results obtained in
Fig. 3(a1-a4). The convergence of the transition probability and cost functional
with the number of iterations steps involved in the optimization is shown in plot
a1. The ﬁgure shows that the dynamical goal is reached perfectly with near 100%
population transfer in the desired state. Plot a2 shows the converged optimized
electric ﬁeld as a function of time. The maximum amplitude of the electric ﬁeld
is 0.0051 Eh /ea0 . The frequency distribution of the optimized ﬁeld is shown in
plot a3. The power spectrum shows the amplitude for the major component of
the optimized electric ﬁeld to be of frequency 1014 cm−1 , while the amplitude
for the component of frequency corresponding to C-O stretch vibration (2005
cm−1 ) is considerably less, which implies a multiphoton nature of the excitation
process. The mechanism of population transfer from initial vibrational state to
ﬁnal vibrational state with time is shown in plot a4. Small contributions from
higher frequencies are also seen in plot a3. As time increases the population of
v = 0 state decreases while that of target vibrational state keeps on increasing.
Up to time 32,000 h
¯ /Eh the system is oscillating between these vibrational states
and at the end of the pulse, the entire population is transferred to the target
v = 5 vibrational state.
(b) Transition: v = 0 → v = 1: In this case, we have propagated the system for 64,000 h
¯ /Eh of time. The pulse length is divided in 32768 time steps.
The initial guess laser ﬁeld is chosen as (t) = 0.0001 · sin(ω0,5 t)s(t) where ω0,5
is the same transition frequency as chosen for previous transition. The convergence of transition probability and cost functional with the number of iterative
steps shows (Fig. 3(b1)). The ﬁgure shows that the desired goal is achieved, but
clearly population has been transferred to some more highly excited states during the excitation process. Further work is in progress to better characterise the
excitation process and to try to ﬁnd better electric ﬁelds to achieve the desired
goal. The optimized electric ﬁeld is shown in plot b2 of Fig. 3. The frequency
spectrum of the optimized ﬁeld shown in plot b3 is quite complex, which shows
the contributions from many frequencies. The plot b4 shows the evolution of the
populations of the lowest 6 vibrational states as a function of time.

Conclusion

Our optimal control calculations of vibrational excitations in the active part
of the biologically important molecule carboxy-myoglobin provides laser ﬁelds
which lead to selective vibrational excitations within the molecule, subject to the
simpliﬁcations inherent in the model of the system. We have discussed our results for two vibrational excitation processes. The shape of the optimized electric
ﬁeld and its corresponding frequency spectrum is quite complex for the second
transition considered, namely, v = 0 −→ v = 1 corresponding essentially to
excitation of the Fe-C bond. We are able to achieve our dynamical goals with
nearly 100% population transfer at the end of the pulse. The evolution of vibrational states involved in both the transitions show that there is some missing
population. This population must have been transferred temporarily to higher

lying vibrational states. Another pertinent issue is a change in the polarity of
the triatomic for Fe-C bond distances beyond the range shown in Fig. 2. It is
possible that this introduces some complexity into the molecule-radiation interaction. These aspect are being investigated further. Application of OCT to the
photodissociation of the Fe-C bond in carboxy-myoglobin is also in progress.
