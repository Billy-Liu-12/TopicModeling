Abstract
Standby redundant system is a powerful tool to enhance the reliability, availability, quality, and safety of operational plants. This
study proposed an approximate TZ (the weakest t-norm) fuzzy Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) simulation
technology to simulate two-unit standby redundant system reliability. The approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations employ
principle of interval arithmetic under the TZ arithmetic operations. Therefore, the novel fuzzy arithmetic operations may obtain
fitter decision values, which have smaller fuzziness accumulating, under vague environment. In numerical examples the
approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations has evidenced that it can successfully calculate results of fuzzy operations as interval
arithmetic, and can more effectively reduce fuzzy spreads. In the real fuzzy repairable reliability model the performance also
shows that the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations successfully simulate/analyze the two-unit standby redundant system
reliability and obtain more confident fuzzy results under vague environment.

Keywords: the weakest t-norm; fuzzy GERT; two-unit standby redundant system reliability

1. Introduction
Two-unit standby redundant systems have been extensively studied ([1], [12], and [27]). However, in practice,
standby systems are often subjected to an appropriate priority rule, and exists some uncertain factors in two-unit
standby redundant systems. Hence, two-unit standby redundant system reliability simulation will effectively help to
evaluate their system in plant. Moreover, two-unit standby redundant system reliability has exist some uncertain
factors or subjective judgement. The study proposed an approximate TZ (the weakest t-norm) fuzzy GERT to
simulate two-unit standby redundant system reliability.
Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) is a popularly graphical tool for the analysis of complex
systems because GERT can easily analyze of stochastic networks with logical node and directed branches. The
GERT is a network technique similar to program evaluation and review technique (PERT). However unlike PERT,
the GERT can handle ‚ÄòInclusive-OR Node‚Äô as well as ‚ÄòAnd Node‚Äô. Prisker and Whitehouse [28] reviewed and

directed that GERT combines the disciplines of flowgraph theory, moment generating functions and PERT. GERT
has the following features (1) Each network consists of nodes denoting logical operation and directed branches. (2)
A branch has a probability that the activity associated with it will be performed. (3) Other parameters describe the
activities represented by the branches. These parameters are usually additive, such as time or cost [8]. In recenty
years GERT analysis also has been applied to project management, evaluation of R&D (Research and Development)
processes,... and so on ([10], [20], [21]). However, in real industry situation GERT analysis is applied, it can be
observed that some variables/parameters of flow may belong to the uncertain factors. Therefore, the traditional
GERT model may need to be extended to treat the vague variables or parameters [17]. Fuzzy set and logic
introduced by Zadeh [30] represents another useful tool for dealing with the uncertainties in addition to the
probability theory. Fuzzy set theory has been viewed as a useful tool especially for dealing with the complex
systems, in which the interactions of the system‚Äôs variables may be too complex to precisely specified. Itakura and
Nishikawa [17] firstly adopted fuzzy logic to structure GERT. Cheng [8] developed the fuzzy GERT method to
calculate fuzzy reliability with D-cut arithmatic because of sparse component failure data, human errors, certain
factors, etc.. Liu et al. [22] adopted operations of triangular fuzzy numbers to formulate fuzzy GERT model and
analysis process reliability in semiconductor manufacturing and can obtains efficient and simplified results of
analysis.
However, we could find that fuzzy GERT may obtain different simulated efficiency and performance while
adopting various forms of fuzzy arithmetic [22], and the fuzzy arithmetic operations have necessary condition which
operation with triangular fuzzy numbers in [22]. Fuzzy arithmetic, following the Zadeh‚Äôs extension principle [30] in
fuzzy set theory, was first investigated by [9], [26], [25], amongst others. Among them, based on the Zadeh‚Äôs
extension principle, fuzzy arithmetic has been investigated in the approximate and exact manners (see [2], [4] and [5]
for reviews). They have included the Zadeh‚Äôs original sup-min operator (see [9] and [11] for reviews), other t-norm
operators (see [13]) for a review, [29], and the TZ weakest t-norm operator ([16], [19], [24], [6], [15]), and others
based on the inverse of the membership functions (see [23]). Among these operators, the D-cut fuzzy arithmetic as
most often used, will be examined here. Moreover, the study develops the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operators
with the weakest t-norm arithmetic, will be examined here. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
Introduction of the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operators is given in Section 2. The basic principle of fuzzy GERT
is briefly introduced in Section 3. Section 4 examines numerical example fuzzy two-unit standby redundant systems
reliability model with proposed approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations. Some concluding remarks are offered in
Section 5.
2. The proposed approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations
Since our study concerns the fuzzy arithmetic, this section will breifly introduce some basic definitions of fuzzy
arithmetic. Firstly, for fuzzy sets or fuzzy numbers on the real line ¬É, the basic definitions and the fuzzy arithmetic
are as follows.
Fuzzy numbersLet iA be a fuzzy set or a fuzzy number (FN) on ¬É and can be written as (a1, a2, a3), where a2
thus denotes the mode and a1 and a3 denote the left and right bounds respectively of iA , with the membership
function iA( x) that defines the membership grades of elements x ¬è ¬É to iA :
x  a1 ,

where L and R respectively denote the left and right shape functions of iA( x) , and L and R are necessary satisfying
below conditions:
(1) L(0) = R(0) = 1 and L(1) = R(1) = 0 and for x¬è(0,1), L(x) ¬è(0,1), R(x) ¬è(0,1).
(2) L and R are non-increasing and continuous functions from [0, 1] to [0, 1].

In particular, the fuzzy numbers with triangular membership functions or called triangular fuzzy numbers (TFNs)
may be shown as

For an interval of confidence or D-cut at level D ¬è (0, 1), an ordinary subset AD of A may be defined:
AD

or given for a TFN

AD

[a1(D ) , a2(D ) ] [a1  D (a2  a1 ), a3  D (a3  a2 )],

(2)

where a1(D ) and a2(D ) respectively denote the lower and upper bounds of AD.
In the fuzzy arithmetic approaches, Zadeh‚Äôs sup-min operator can be stated as
i )( z )
(i
AD B

i ( y )),
sup x D y z min( i
A( x), B

(3)

where D denotes any arithmetic operation. Eq. (3) may be shown that can be performed in the equivalent manner by
using the D-cuts of fuzzy numbers and the interval arithmetic (e.g., see [25]). The resulting fuzzy arithmetic may be
called the D-cut (fuzzy) arithmetic. By the D-cut arithmetic, the addition/subtraction, multiplication/division, and
others may be performed at each D on the intervals of confidence by the interval arithmetic (e.g., also see [18]). The
D-cuts of fuzzy numbers and the interval arithmetic can see follows:
Addition of D-cut arithmetic Following the interval operation let A and B be two FNs and BD = [b1(D ) , b2(D ) ] , D
¬è (0, 1]. A , B ¬è ¬É , we can write
AD  BD

[a1(D ) , a2(D ) ]  [b1(D ) , b2(D ) ] [a1(D )  b1(D ) , a2(D )  b2(D ) ], D ¬è (0,1].

(4)

Subtraction of D-cut arithmetic It can be defined as:  A , B and D ¬è (0, 1],
AD  BD

[a1(D ) , a2(D ) ]  [b1(D ) , b2(D ) ] [a1(D )  b2(D ) , a2(D )  b1(D ) ], D ¬è (0,1].

(5)

Multiplication of D-cut arithmetic It can be defined as:  A , B and D ¬è (0, 1],
AD u BD

[a1(D ) , a2(D ) ] u [b1(D ) , b2(D ) ] [min(a1(D ) b1(D ) , a1(D ) b2(D ) , a2(D ) b1(D ) , a2(D ) b2(D ) ),

max(a1(D ) b1(D ) , a1(D ) b2(D ) , a2(D ) b1(D ) , a2(D ) b2(D ) )], D ¬è (0,1].

(6)

Division of D-cut arithmetic It can be defined as:  A , B and D ¬è (0, 1],
AD y BD

[a1(D ) , a2(D ) ] y [b1(D ) , b2(D ) ] [min(a1(D ) / b1(D ) , a1(D ) / b2(D ) , a2(D ) / b1(D ) , a2(D ) / b2(D ) ),

max(a1(D ) / b1(D ) , a1(D ) / b2(D ) , a2(D ) / b1(D ) , a2(D ) / b2(D ) )], D ¬è (0,1].

Thus, by Eqs. (4) to (7), the D-cut arithmetic if repeatedly performed in an equation will accumulate the fuzziness
of all fuzzy numbers involved. This property can be observed in complex systems when performed for each fuzzy
interval [6]. Therefore, in order to reduce accumulates the fuzziness the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations
adopt the weakest t-norm arithmetic operations with different D values. In the Zadeh‚Äôs extension principle [30], if
generalized by using a general norm T that replaces the original ‚Äòmin‚Äô, and the binary T norm on the interval [0, 1] is
said to be a triangular norm (or called t-norm) iff it is associative, commutative, and monotonous in [0, 1] and T(x, 1)
= x for every x ¬è [0, 1]. Therefore, Eq. (3) can be written as
i )( z )
( iA D B

i ( y )),
sup x D y z T ( iA( x), B

(8)

Moreover, each t-norm may be shown to satisfy the following inequalities.
TZ (a2 , b2 ) d T (a2 , b2 ) d TM (a2 , b2 ) min(a2 , b2 ) ,
where
¬≠a2 , if b2 1,
¬∞
TZ (a2 , b2 ) ¬Æb2 , if a2 1,
¬∞0, otherwise,
¬Ø
TZ is the weakest t-norm. The importance of t-norms, e.g., min(a2, b2), a2¬òb2, max(0, a2 + b2  1), TZ (a2, b2), has
been shown in [9], [16]. Two characters could be observed in previous researches. First, it is well known that the
addition/subtraction of fuzzy numbers by TM and TZ preserves the original shape of the fuzzy numbers. With the TM
in the multiplication/division the shapes of the original FNs may not be preserved. However, for given shapes, in the
multiplication the TZ preserves the original FNs‚Äô shape. Second, the weakest t-norm operations can get more exact
performance, which means smaller fuzzy spreads, under uncertainty environment [16]. This exact performance may
successfully reduce accumulating phenomenon of fuzziness in complexity fuzzy systems. The addition, subtraction,
multiplication and division of TZ fuzzy arithmetic can see these researches [19], [24], [13], [14], [16] and [6].
In this section the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations will be proposed. Due to some viewpoints of the
approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations are similar that De Baets et al. [2] proposed the additional based on ordinal
sums, some propositions of additional based on ordinal sums would be introduced in follows [2].
Proposition 1. Consider a t-norm T and two fuzzy quantities A and B, then it holds that
A T B ¬é A  B .
Proposition 2. Consider a t-norm T. For any idempotent element c of T the following equality holds, for any two
fuzzy intervals A and B (not necessarily with the same shape):
( A T B)( c ) A( c )  B ( c ) for any c ¬è [0,1].

In this paper the approximate fuzzy arithmetic has some characters different from previous researches. Firstly we
adopt interval arithmetic process, which repeat the same process level by level, to approximate continuous function.
Moreover, in order to observe the smallest fuzzy accumulating we only employ the weakest t-norm operations while
executing fuzzy operations. Hence, the propositions of TZ additional based on ordinal sums would be introduced as
follows:
Proposition 3. Consider a t-norm T. For any D-cut of T the following impaction holds, for any two fuzzy intervals A
and B (not necessarily with the same shape):
( A TZ B )(D ) d A(D )  B (D ) for any D ¬è [0,1].
Proof. Consider a D-cuts of T, then the definition of ordinal subset Eq. (1) and (2) and Proposition 1 imply that
( A T B)(D ) A(D )  B (D ) for any D ¬è [0,1].

3130

Kuo-Ping Lin et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1326‚Äì1335

The fact that minimum operator is the strongest t-norm. Hence, based on each t-norm may satisfy inequalities the
following inequalities can be derived
( A TZ B )(D ) d ( A T B)(D ) ¬é ( A  B )(D ) A(D )  B (D ) for any D ¬è [0,1].
On the other hand, let x¬èA(D) and y¬èB(D) , then TZ(A(x), B(y))t TZ(c, c)=c. Hence,
A TZ B( x  y )
sup TZ ( A(u )  B(v)) t D .
u v x y

The foregoing propositions imply that the graph of A TZ B always lies below the graph of A+B, and touches the
graph of A+B when the corresponding values is an D-cuts of T. Our proposed approximate function method may be
performed as D-cuts arithmetic at each D on the intervals of confidence by the interval arithmetic. The Fig. 1

3. Approximate TZ fuzzy GERT
Fuzzy GERT has been proposed by [8], [7], and [17]. Now in this section this study will briefly introduce
procedure and concept of TZ fuzzy GERT. The following steps show our proposed TZ fuzzy GERT.
Step 1) Convert a qualitative description of a fuzzy system/fuzzy problem, and determine logical nodes. A node in
a stochastic network consists of an input side and an output side. Three logical relations on the input side and two
relations on the output side are considered in GERT (see Fig. 2). For notational convenience, Fig. 3 combines the
input and output symbols to show six possible nodes types.

necessary.

Step 4) Based on means of the Mason‚Äôs rule obtain simply fuzzy function. For the solution of an open flow graph,
Mason‚Äôs rule must be adopted. Some steps must be performed while using the Mason‚Äôs rule. (i) Close the network
with an arc. (ii) Obtain all the possible loops of order m. (iii) Add the expressions for all the loops of the same order
m and multiply by (1)m. (iv) add 1 to the expression obtained in (iii) and equal to zero as following equation:

4. Fuzzy two unit standby redundant system reliability with approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations

Two-unit standby redundant systems have been extensively studied. The study presents a fuzzy mathematical
model representing two-unit standby redundant systems based on fuzzy GERT. The fuzzy GERT model represents a
repairable two unit system with one unit in operation and the other one in standby mode. The system operates in the
changing environments. The failed units are repairable. The system ceases to function when both the units are nonoperative. The system state transition diagram is shown Fig. 4. From actual observing the fuzzy GERT model has

Based on approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations we can obtain the fuzzy reliability after thoriugh T time with
different D value shows in Fig. 5 Some phenomenons can be obserbed. First, this study successfully adopts
approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations to evaluate two-unit standby redundant systems reliability models based on
fuzzy GERT simulation technology. Second, the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations can obtain various
decision values as D-cut arithmetic, and have smaller fuzziness accumulating (exact solution) as TZ arithmetic
operations, under vague environment. Third, decision-maker can adopt suitable fuzzy reliability with different Dlevel for maintaining/purchasing strategy. Since based on the TZ arithmetic operations the evaluation of fuzzy
reliability can obtain exacter solution, the results may be more credible by using our proposed TZ fuzzy GERT.

5. Conclusion

In this paper we developed an approximate fuzzy arithmetic to evaluate fuzzy two-unit standby redundant system
reliability based on fuzzy GERT simulation technology. This fuzzy arithmetic can calculate basic operations with
non-triangular membership functions as interval arithmetic, and the fuzzy arithmetic can obtain less fuzzy
accumulation and efficient computing results than interval arithmetic as the TZ arithmetic. The study successfully
applies the novel fuzzy arithmetic to evaluate fuzzy two-unit standby redundant system reliability problems. Again
the result also provides evidence that our proposed arithmetic operations can get smaller fuzzy spreads and efficient
computing results than interval arithmetic. Further research may consider examining more complicated fuzzy
reliability models by our proposed TZ fuzzy GERT. This may show more clearly the advantages of our proposed
fuzzy arithmetic operations. Others applications of fuzzy arithmetic operations may also be considered, such as
fuzzy system dynamics, fuzzy weighted average, and inventory problems.
