Abstract. In wireless sensor networks, an efficient Medium Access Control
(MAC) protocol is critical, especially in terms of energy consumption and message latency. This paper introduces a novel protocol that nodes periodically
sleep to conserve energy. When the source node has data packets to send, it
uses a wakeup message to awake the sleeping nodes. The protocol needn’t take
the synchronization which must be achieved in S-MAC. It especially suits to the
wireless sensor networks with narrow bandwidth.
Keywords: wireless sensor networks, media access control (MAC).

1 Introduction
Wireless sensor networks have emerged as one of the dominant technology trends of
this decade (2000-2010) [1]. A wireless sensor network is comprised of a large number of tiny wireless senor nodes that are capable of sensing the environment and
communicating in an ad-hoc fashion to deliver relevant information to the user. The
small form factor of these nodes limits the battery life available for their operation.
Furthermore, a critical event detected by the sensor network should be delivered to
the user as soon as possible. Thus, for sensor networks, energy efficiency and latency
both are the important parameters. In this paper, we present a novel medium access
control protocol. It not only conserves energy through making the sensor nodes periodically sleep, but also has a low latency.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 analysis the defects of
other MAC protocol in sensor networks, and describes our proposed protocol, An
Adaptive Energy-efficient and Low-latency MAC Protocol (EL-MAC). Section 3
compares the performance of EL-MAC with existing mechanisms via simulations.
Section 4 concludes the paper and presents our future work.

2 An Adaptive Energy-Efficient and Low-Latency MAC Protocol
In S-MAC [2], the periodic sleep may result in high latency, especially for multihop
routing algorithms, because all the intermediate nodes have their own sleep schedules.

An Adaptive Energy-Efficient and Low-Latency MAC Protocol

The disadvantage of LAS-MAC [3] is that the nodes having data to forward must wait
for next duty circle when they overhear interference, but the channel may not always
be busy in this duty circle. So the throughput is reduced. The disadvantage of TWMAC [4] is that a busy tone must be transmitted before every data packet, this leads
to energy waste and message latency. As mentioned, previous protocols have these
defects. So a novel protocol with better performance is proposed in this paper. In our
protocol, nodes periodically sleep to conserve energy, and the control messages are
reduced on the premise that the reliable transmission is ensured. All of these cause
energy conservation, latency decrease and throughput increase.
For brevity, we supposed that the carrier sensing range (radius) is one time larger
than the transmission range[5-6]. Radios typically have four power levels corresponding to the following states: transmitting, receiving, listening, and sleeping. Typically,
the power required to listen is about the same as the power to transmit and receive.
The sleep power is usually one or four orders of magnitude less. Thus, a sensor should
sleep as much as possible when it is not engaged in communication. EL-MAC make
sensor nodes periodically sleep to conserve energy. Each node can be awaked by the
wakeup signal at listen period.

Fig. 1. Overview of EL-MAC

As shown in Fig.1, When a source node (node-a) has data to be sent to the sink
node, It first sends a busy tone to wakeup its receiver (node-b). Nodes are not synchronized and, therefore, do not know the phase of each other’s listen-sleep cycles in
the listen mode. To avoid missing the short time that node-b has its radio on, the busy
tone must be long enough to guarantee that all neighbors can sense the wakeup signal.
When node-a sends the busy tone, its second hop neighbor (node-c) which is at the
carrier sensing zone of node-a also can sense the wakeup signal. So node-b and nodec change their states to listening together. After the busy tone transmission, the source
node listens for a short time. If the channel is idle, the data packet will be transmitted
in succession. The data packet must be larger than the busy tone. If receiver, node-b,
received the data packet successfully and it is not the sink node, it will forward the
data packet to the next hop neighbor (node-c). Here, node-c has been waked up, so it
can correctly receive that packet. Node-a will consider the data packet sent by node-b
as the virtual ACK which denotes the data packet sent by node-a was successfully

received by node-b, if not it repeats to transmit the packet. Then, if the packet needs
to be forwarded further, the process is repeated until the sink node receives the data
packet successfully and returns an ACK packet.

3 Simulations and Performance Evaluation
We run simulations using opnet. 100 nodes are deployed randomly in an area of 300
300m2. We choose three source nodes and one sink node from the different corner.The radio range (radius) is 30m. We set the bandwidth to 20kbps. Each data
packet size is 250bytes, and control packet size is 10 bytes. The busy tone packet size
should be 50 bytes.We use the same energy consumption model as in [7] for the radio
hardware. The simulation time is one hour.
We compare EL-MAC against S-MAC without the synchronization function. The
energy consumption versus duty cycle is plotted in Fig.2. This result exactly demonstrates that EL-MAC can implement energy conservation task successfully.
Fig.3 shows the latency that data packets pass from a source node to a sink node. It
shows that EL-MAC performs as better as 802.11 MAC on data packets passing latency. The reason is that the data packet passing of EL-MAC nearly doesn’t have the
sleep latency expounded in [2].

Fig.4 shows the measured throughput for different duty cycle on the sink node. The
busy tone becomes small when the duty cycle increases, this diminishes the cost of
retransmission, in turn, diminishes the useless load of network. So EL-MAC throughput increases along with the duty cycle. As is shown, the EL-MAC have a much
higher throughput than S-MAC.

4 Conclusions and Future Work
This paper presents a novel MAC protocol for wireless sensor networks. Compared to
S-MAC, it makes following improvements: minimizing the latency of data passing,
increasing the potential space of energy conserving.
Future work includes system scaling studies, parameter analysis and listen time
decrease. More simulations will be done for the parameter analysis. The physical
layer capability should be improved, so as to decrease the listen time.
