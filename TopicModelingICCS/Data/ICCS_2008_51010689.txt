Abstract. The evaluation of the influence of the examined mesh structure on
the computational results is considered in this paper. The annular plates with
three-layered, cross-section structure having the soft core in the range of critical
behaviour after loss of static and dynamic stability have been analysed. Several
meshes of plate models, which can be applied in numerical calculations have
been presented. The results obtained in finite element method have been compared with the results of plates solved using the finite difference method. The
analysis has been undertaken in the wide range of the examined problems taking into account not only the global forms of plate critical deformations but also
the other local ones and analysing different plate buckling forms with several
transverse waves in circumferential direction, too. In the discussion the rate of
the sensitivity of the presented plate models depending on their problem application has been noticed.
Keywords: mesh model, sandwich plate, static, dynamic stability, FEM, FDM.

1 Introduction
The different critical and overcritical behaviours of the sandwich structure of plates
under lateral loads require building of the proper computational model. The geometrical and material parameters of the component layers of the structure essentially determine its behaviour, especially, when there are significant differences among them.
Widely examined structure of three-layered plate with soft, foam, thick core is exactly
such object, which computational model shows the significant sensitivity for the accepted parameters describing it. The way of building of such structure of plate with
annular shape, which enables the solution to the static and dynamic plate problem,
with the indication on its computational sensitivity has been considered in this paper.
In the range of the axisymmetric dynamic stability problems of sandwich plates (
among others ) recently appeared works [1], [2] could be mentioned.

2 Problem Formulation
The problem undertaken in this paper consists in the evaluation of the influence of the
model structure of the three-layered plate on the computational results. The annular

plate with the soft core compressed in the facings plane by the loads acting on the
inner or/and outer their perimeters is the subject of the analysis. The scheme of plate
loading is presented in Fig. 1. Such loads make the loss of plate stability, characterized by the critical parameters, like: critical static or dynamic load, form of buckling
and critical deflection. These quantities for the plate examples differing in the model
built by means of the finite element method have been analysed in this work.
The examined, exemplary plate has the slidably clamped edges; symmetrical crosssectional structure and the following material and geometrical parameters:
- the inner radius ri=0.2 m;
- the outer radius ro=0.5 m;
- the facing thickness (equal for each facing ) h'=0.0005 m or h'=0.001 m;
- the core thickness h2=0.005 m, 0.02 m, 0.06 m;
- the steel facing material with Young's modulus E=2.1⋅105 MPa, Poisson's ratio
ν=0.3 and mass density μ=7.85⋅103 kg/m3 ;
- two polyurethane foam core material with the value of Kirchhoff's modulus equal
to G2=5 MPa and mass density μ2=64 kg/m3 [3] or with G2=15.82 MPa and μ2=93.6
kg/m3 [4]; value of Poisson's ratio, equal to ν=0.3 and values of Young's modulus
E2=13 MPa and E2=41.13 MPa calculated treating the foam material as an isotropic,
respectively.

The obtained results in finite element method have been compared with the computational results of plates solved using the finite difference method. Building the
models of plate structure solved in both methods: finite element (FEM) and finite
difference (FDM) the distribution of the basic stress on the normal and shearing carrying by the plate layers: facings and core has been used. Such loading distribution of
the layers of plate with soft core is the assumption of the classical theory of sandwich
plate. In work [5] the proposal of the application of the mixed shell and solid elements
in mesh structure has been presented. It has been used in the modelling of the structure of the analysed plate. The application of the shell elements with the option
COMPOSITE to specify a shell cross-section for the plates with soft core does not
assure the proper results in plate stability problem. The calculations of the plate models built of shell elements for elastic core characteristics corresponding to the facings
material parameters have been presented in work [6].

2.1 Plate Models Built in Finite Element Method
The calculations were carried out in the ABAQUS system at the Academic Computer
Center CYFRONET-CRACOW (KBN/SGL_ORIGIN_2000/PŁódzka/030/1999) [7].
The model in the form of the full annulus of plate is the basic model accepted in problem analysis. This model is composed of the 9-node 3D shell elements and 27-node
3D solid elements building the facings and core meshes, respectively. The mesh of the
model is presented in Fig. 2a.

The examinations of the selected forms of plate critical deformations have been
carried out for the models in the form of an annular sector being the 1/8 or 1/6 part of
the full plate perimeter. The facings mesh is built of 9-node 3D shell elements and
core mesh is built of 27-node 3D solid elements, too. The solid elements could be
arranged in single or double layers in core mesh. The models are presented in Fig. 2b.
The mesh of the model for some plate examples, which minimal value of critical
load pcr ( important in stability problem ) corresponds to the form of regular, axiallysymmetrical buckling could be simplified to the form - where only the axisymmetric
elements are used. The cross-section structure presented in Fig. 2c is composed of 3node shell and 8-node solid elements arranged in single, double and quaternary core
mesh layer. The regular, axially-symmetrical form of plate buckling corresponds to
the minimal value of the critical load for plates slidably clamped and compressed on
inner perimeter [8].
Each of analyzed plate model uses the surface contact interaction to connect the
elements of facings mesh with elements of core mesh. The option TIE has been applied. The proper, symmetry conditions on the partitioned edges have been formulated
for the annular sector models. The boundary conditions with the limitation of radial
relative displacements in the plate slidably clamped edges are imposed on the outer

and inner plate edges. The introduction of the additional condition for the plate layers,
by their connection with the equal deflection, increases the numbers of examined
plate models.
2.2 Solution to the Plate Stability Problem Using the Finite Difference Method
The solution uses the classical theory of sandwich plates with the broken line hypothesis [8]. The equal deflections of plate layers have been assumed. The basic elements in the solution to the static stability problem are as follows:
-

-

-

formulation of the equilibrium equations for each of plate layer,
determination of the equations of radial and circumferential core deformation,
formulation of the physical relations of the material of plate layers,
on the strength of the equations of the sectional forces and moments and suitable
equilibrium equations determination of the formulas of the resultant radial and
circumferential forces and the resultant membrane radial, circumferential and shear
forces determined by means of the introduced stress function,
by the usage of the equilibrium equations of the projections in the 3-direction of
forces loading the plate layers the formulation of the basic differential equation describing the deflections of the analyzed plate,
determination of the additional equilibrium equations of projections in the radial
and circumferential directions of forces loading the undeformed outer plate layers,
determination of the boundary conditions and dimensionless quantities,
assumption that the stress function is a solution to the disk state,
application of the finite difference method for the approximation of the derivatives
with respect to radius and the solution to the eigen-value problem with the calculation of the minimal value of p* as the critical static load pcr:

Presented in this work, the results of plate dynamic stability calculations have been
limited to the regular, axially-symmetrical form of plate critical deformation. This
form corresponds to the minimal value of critical load for analyzed plates compressed
on the inner facings parameters. Then, the solution requires the formulation:

The description of the solution is presented in work [10].
The numerical calculations in finite difference method require the proper choice of
the number of discrete points to fulfil the results accuracy up to 5% of the technical
error. The calculation were carried out for number 14 of discrete points.

3 Discussion of Computational Results
The discussion of computational results of analyzed plates has been presented separating the static and dynamic stability plate problems. It was also taken notice on the
examples of plates with the core thickness treated as the medium for h2 equal to
h2=0.005 m, 0.02 m and the thick: h2=0.06 m.

3.1 Critical Static Loads
The observed buckling forms of analyzed plates loaded on inner edge are regular,
axially-symmetrical, but the plates compressed on the outer perimeter lose their stability for the different number m of the transverse waves in circumferential direction.
The global, quasi-euler’s forms of critical plate buckling are essentially observed. For
plate with thick core are expected the primary, local forms of the loss of plate stability, when the critical deformations of plate layers (the core, particularly) do not occur
for their equal deflections.

3.1.1 Analysis of Plates with Medium Core
The computational results of different models of plates loaded on inner edge are presented in Table 1. The critical form of deformation is the regular axially-symmetrical
for all plates examples. For the each plate model it is presented in Fig. 3.

The consistence of results of all FEM plate models is observed. The good compatibility of values of critical loads of plates calculated in finite difference and finite element methods is particularly observed for plates with the core thickness, equal to

this condition. The increase in these values above the values calculated for FDM plate
model appears for plates with thin facings h’=0.0005 m and thicker core (h2=0.02 m).

Results show the slightly increase in values of critical loads of plates with the condition of the equal layers deflection. Then, the change of plate buckling in the form of
the decrease in the number m waves could occur.
Additionally, in Table 3 the results of the select plate examples obtained for the
annular sector of plate model are presented. These values of critical loads are suitably
higher than results obtained for full annulus plate model.

3.1.2 Analysis of Plates with Thick Core
The results of various models of plates compressed on inner perimeter are presented
in Table 4. The results marked by * concern the plate models, which critical deformation has not the regular, axially-symmetrical form. For all examined models the decrease in values of critical loads and the change in the form of critical deformation is
observed for the plates with thin facings h’=0.0005 m and thick core h2=0.06 m and
particularly for the core Kirchhoff’s moduls equal to G2=15.82 MPa. The examples

The results obtained for plates with connected layers by the condition of the equal
deflection are the obvious exception. Then, the values of loads and the global buckling forms correspond to the results obtained for plates models calculated in FDM. It
could be suspected that these values are too high. The values of critical loads of plates
models built of two or four layers of the core elements are lower than values obtained
for the models with single core layer. Particularly, the essential decrease in values of
critical loads is observed for the plate model in the form of the annular sector with the
double core layer.

The sensitivity of plate models with thin facings and thick core is observed for plate
compressed on the outer perimeter, too. Example results are presented in Table 5.

Plate layers connected with the condition of the equal deflection.

Also for plates loaded on the outer edge the values of critical loads of models with
connected layers seem to be to high. Results obtained for the annular sector of plate
with the connected layers are both in values of critical loads and the forms of buckling
closer to the results obtained in finite difference method.

3.2 Critical Dynamic Loads
The calculations of the critical dynamic loads have been carried out for the plates
compressed on inner edges of the facings with the linear, rapidly increasing stress
expressed by the formula:

Some Remarks about Modelling of Annular Three-Layered Plate Structure

p=st
where:
p - compressive stress, s – rate of plate loading growth, t – time.

697

(2)

The rate of plate loading growth s is equal for each of numerical analysed plate.
The value of the rate s is the result of the following equation: s=K7⋅pcr . The value of
parameter K7 is accepted as K7=20. Solving the eigenproblem the value of critical
stress pcr is equal: pcr=217.3 MPa calculated for the plate with the facing thickness
h'=0.001 m, core thickness h2=0.01 m and the value of core Kirchhoff's modulus
equal: G2=15.82 MPa.
The calculations are carried out for the regular, axially-symmetrical form of plate
buckling. This form has the plate predeflection, too. As the criterion of loss of plate
stability, the criterion presented in work [11] was adopted. According to this criterion
the loss of plate stability occurs at the moment of time when the speed of the point of
maximum deflection reaches the first maximum value.
The results of some plate examples obtained using the finite element method in the
form of time histories of plate maximum deflection and the velocity of deflection are

presented in Fig. 6. Table 6 shows the values of critical, dynamic loads and critical
deflections for the plate models built in finite element and finite difference methods.
The results obtained in FEM indicate a mutually good consistency. For plate with
thicker core h2=0.02 m and 0.06 m these results correspond to the results obtained in
finite difference method, too. The major fluctuations are observed for the plate critical deflections. The calculations show that in dynamic problem in the range of the
global buckling observations the influence of the plate structure built in finite element
method on the final results is not so essential, like is static analysis.

4 Conclusions
The results obtained for presented different models, which are possible to application
in computational plate examinations, indicate on some sensitivity of their structures.
The observed differences of values of critical loads, particularly of plates with thick
core are in the range of the dozens MPa. Therefore, these differences are significant.
Particularly, this problem concerns the static stability issue, when other than global
critical forms could occur. The study of the mesh structure of these plates models
seems to be especially important. The lowest values of critical loads are for plate
models with the mesh core composed of the several layers of solid elements. The
computational results of these models could be the essential complement to the plate
examinations carried out for their basic model in the form of full annulus.
Comparing the computational results of plates calculated in two methods: finite
element and finite difference essentially, it can be determined the compatibility of the
results of plate models with medium core. The consistency of results of plates with
thick core is observed for these cases of plate models, which critical deformation has
the global, quasi-euler’s form. Then, the values of critical, static loads could be really
