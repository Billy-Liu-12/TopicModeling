Abstract. Recently, cement augmentation technique was introduced to enhance
screw fixation within the femoral head. This study investigates biomechanical
efficacies of cement augmentation technique. Finite element models of the
femur with sliding hip screw assemblies were constructed with and without
bone cement augmentation. Appropriate contact conditions with varying
friction coefficients were assigned to simulate the fracture planes and other
interfacial regions. With cement augmentation, 80% reduction in stresses was
found in the cancellous bone, suggesting reduced possibility of cancellous bone
fracture and screw cut-outs. The peak von Mises stress within the cement
mantle was about 1/3 of its fatigue strength, which suggested the longevity of
the cement mantle and less likelihood of osteolysis due to cement debris.
Micromotions at the hip screw interfaces were also dwon from 0.275mm to
0.008mm, an indication for strong fixation after the surgery.

1 Introduction
Recent findings estimate that intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFF) occur in more
than 200,000 patients each year in the United States alone, with reported mortality
rates ranging from 15% to 20% [1]. Most IFFs occur in patients over 70 years of age
and they are likely to increase each year as the population of these age group
increases. Traffic accidents contribute significant increase in patient numbers as well.
One of the most commonly used surgical treatments for IFF is using internal
fixation devices such as sliding compression hip screws with side plate assemblies.
These devices are considered to be safe with minimum amount of drilling of the
cancellous bone in the femoral head and neck region. They allow early weightbearing and limit interfacial movement on the fracture plane by providing strong
compressive forces.
Clinical studies show, however, that superior cutting-out through the femoral head
by the sliding hip screw is one of the major complications [2,3]. Improper screw
placement has been cited as one of the major contributing factors. Frequent non-union

on the fracture plane often requires revision surgery that can compound more surgical
difficulties [2,4]. For patients with severe osteoporosis in which the primary
compression trabecular structures have diminished in considerable proportions can be
more prone to this type of complication and may add further surgical challenges.
Therefore, it is very important to maintain strong fixation of the sliding hip screws
within the femur with minimum amount of sliding motion for optimal bony-healing.
Biomechanical studies have been done to elucidate the effects of biomechanical
factors such as the placement angle of the hip screws, positioning within the femoral
head and neck, and the effect of anatomical reduction [5,6]. Recently, augmenting of
hip screws with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) has been suggested to provide
more secure fixation of the screws within the femoral region [3,4]. Clinical study by
Cheng et al (1989) found that cement augmentation may provide initial stability but
can lead to late complications if not properly used [7]. Bartucci et al (1985) advocated
limiting the use of PMMA on the proximal side to prevent intrusion of the cement
into the fracture plane [4]. Using cadaveric femurs Choueka et al (1995) investigated
biomechanical effects of using various types of sliding hip screws and/or dome
plunger in terms of load-bearing and fixation strength [2].
This study was designed to investigate the biomechanical feasibility of the bone
cement augmentation technique. The changes in stress distributions due to cement
augmentation were studied. For this purpose, finite element models of the operated
femur with sliding hip screw assemblies were constructed with and without bone
cement augmentation. Close attentions were given to the peak von Mises stress within
the cement mantle region to assess the likelihood of cement failure that might lead to
osteolysis due to cement debris. In addition, changes in micromotion at the interfacial
junctions such as screw-cement-surrounding cancenllous bone and fracture plane
were assessed to study the fixation strength that is critical for post-op bony healing.

2 Material Methods
A three-dimensional finite element model of the femur was constructed using
geometric data acquired from computed tomography (CT) scans (Fig. 1).
Intertrochanteric fracture was simulated by assigning a fracture plane from the greater
trochanter to the lesser trochanter at 30 degrees with respect to the long axis of the
femur (Fig. 2). Based on this hip fracture model, two types of surgical model were
generated. One is the non-cemented model (NC) in which only the hip screw
assembly was added to the femur and the other is the cement-augmented model (CA)
where the cement mantle was added to surround the hip screw (Fig. 3).
The dimension of the hip screw assembly as well as screw profiles(screw threads,
pitches, inner and outer diameters) were based on the Richard compression hip screw
(Osteo, Swiss). The distance from the apex of the femoral head to the tip of the screw
known as TAD (Tip-Apex Distance) was set at 20-24mm near the center of the
femoral head according to suggestion by Baumagaertner ea al [8]. The average
thickness of the cement mantle was determined as 12.5mm distributed uniformly over
the hip screw based on the clinical experience of one of the authors (SYK).

The material properties for the anatomical and implants were based on the
findings from literatures (Table I, [9]). To simulate the interfacial conditions,
appropriate friction coefficients ( ) were assigned at the fracture plane ( =0.5), the
interface between screw and surrounding cancellous bone ( =0.5), and between the
screw and the cement ( =0.3). The cement-bone interface was assumed to be rigidly
and the side plate assembly was rigidly fixed to the lateral aspect of the femur. The
sources for the friction coefficient are also listed Table I. 2014N of compressive
loading in a cubic cosine distribution was simulated on the top of the femoral head at
angles of 12 and 26 degrees in sagittal and transverse planes, respectively (Fig. 4).
This loading condition is designed to simulate the after heel strike phase in a gait
cycle in which the highest compressive load is applied to the femur. It was assumed
that the distal part of the model was fixed in all directions. Eight-noded 3-D brick
elements were used for the entire model except for the interfacial regions where the 3D contact elements were used.

3 Results
Strain data from three different locations on the cortical surface of the femur were
compared for the validity check (Table II). Here, two sets of results were in a very
close agreement with each other, thereby confirming the validity of our model.

Results showed that cement augmentation had resulted in decrease in stresses in
the hip screw and in the bone, both cortical and cancellous (Table III), an indication
of favorable stress transfer due to the addition of bone cement. Highest decrease in
stresses was noted with cement augmentation at the cancellous bone region (reduction
of 80%), which makes the further fracture of the femur far less likely in cementaugmented (CA) case than in non-cemented (NC).

In fact, the peak von Mises stresses (PVMS) of 27MPa was aspsessed at the
screw-bone junction in the cancellous bone with NC. This exceeded its yield strength
of 22MPa suggesting the likelihood of micro-fracture in this region. On the other
hand, with CA the corresponding PVMS decreased to 5MPa, making it far less
susceptible to fracture. The PVMS at the screw was considerably lower than its yield
strength. For example, the PVMS at the hip screw were only 322MPa, slightly above
one third of its yield strength of 860MPa (stainless steel). The peak von Mises stress
at the cement region was about 9MPa that was far less than 1/3 of its reported shear
strength of 30MPa and endurance limit of 28MPa at one million cycles [11].
The micromotions at the screw-bone (NC) and the screw-cement (CA) interfaces
were 0.275mm and 0.008mm, respectively. The high level of micromotion in NC
coupled with high PVMS that exceeds the yield strength may all contribute the
eventual cut-out of the screw because the microscale failure of the cancellous bone
and increased micromotion may be initiated

4 Discussion
This study investigated the biomechanical advantages of adding bone cement to
reinforce the hip screw fixation during the surgical treatment of intertrocanteric
fracture of the femur by using clinically relevant finite element (FE) models.
Although the intertrochanteric fractures often occur in elderly patients with
osteoporosis, the material properties of the bone in this study used those of the normal
person in order to elucidate its feasibility in a simplified way. It would be very
interesting to conduct similar studies for varying degrees of osteoporosis to assess its
feasibility by introducing appropriate conversion values for the elastic stiffness in
accordance with the BMD data of a given patient.
Our results clearly suggested the biomechanical advantages of bone cement
augmentation. In particular, the most drastic reduction in stresses was seen at the
cencellous bone. Almost 80% of reduction was noted. This makes the cut-out of the
screw that has been advocated as one of the major complications of the hip screw
systems far less likely to take place. In fact, the PVMS with non-cemented case was
higher than its yield strength (27MPa vs. 22 MPa), a sign of impending loosening of
the hip screw at the screw-bone interface that may progress to cut-out of the screw.
No difference in micromotion at the fracture plane was assessed between two cases
(CA and NC). At the cement-bone interface, we assumed that interdigitization of
cement took place with the irregularities of the bone (i.e., microinterlock). Therefore,
we did not assign any friction coefficient. Rather we took it as continuity (i.e., the
nodes are shared) and no micromotion was assessed here. It should be noted that at
the interface between screw and cement, we adopted the friction coefficient value of
0.3 as suggested by Mann et al [13], which was lower than the that of screw-bone
interface (µ = 0.5, suggested by Shrazi-Adl et al [14]). The initial micromotion
assessed immediately after surgery has been cited as one of the indicators whether
successful bony healing can take place. Studies have shown that micromotion should
be less than (0.15mm) for bony fusion at fracture sites [12]. Based on the magnitudes
of the micromotion predicted from this study (0.008mm with CA), cement
augmentation could reduce the risk of non-union or delayed union of the fracture that
might have had progressed otherwise (0.275mm in NC). Our results also
demonstrated that despite the lower friction coefficient assigned for the screw-cement
interface (CA) its micromotion was substantially less than that of non-cemented (NC).
This may due to the fact that the deformation is inversely proportional to the elastic

modulus. It appears higher modulus of bone cement (E= 22000MPa) as opposed to
the cancellous bone (E= 550MPa) overcame the relative lack of friction and resulted
in less micromotion.
The peak stress found in cement mantle was about less than 1/3 of its fatigue
strength. This suggests that the bone cement mantle may theoretically withstand the
repeated load indefinitely under the loading condition provided in this study.
Although much in-depth study should be done, this result may relieve clinicians from
worries about the likelihood of debris-causing fatigue failure that may initiate the
vicious cycles of osteolysis and implant loosening

5 Conclusion
Our finite element analysis was able to show the following advantages of bone
cement augmentation technique in the treatment of IFF. They can be summarized as:
- A significant reduction in stresses in the cancellous bone: This indicates that
further fractures of the cancellous bone or the screw cut-outs are far less likely
to take place.
- Cement mantle could withstand against the physiological load and further
against the repeated fatigue load.
- Reduced micromotions at the interfacial regions suggest stronger chance of
bony healing.
