Abstract. An RNA pseudoknot is a tertiary structure element formed when
bases of a single-stranded loop pair with complementary bases outside the loop.
Computational determination of the RNA folding structure with pseudoknots
from the linear sequence is a complex problem involving both spatial reasoning
and the use of knowledge of chemistry and biology. We have developed a genetic algorithm for predicting the RNA folding structure with pseudoknots of
any type. This paper analyzes the predictions by the genetic algorithm with different population generation methods and fitness functions, and compares the
predictions to those by a dynamic programming method.

1 Introduction
An RNA pseudoknot is a tertiary structural element formed when bases of a singlestranded loop pair with complementary bases outside the loop. Pseudoknots are not
only widely occurring structural motifs in all kinds of viral RNA molecules, but also
responsible for several important functions of RNA. The RNA folding structure with
pseudoknots is much more difficult to predict than the RNA secondary structure because prediction of pseudoknots should consider tertiary interactions as well as secondary interactions.
In the computational viewpoint, predicting RNA structure can be considered as an
optimization problem. Many prediction algorithms obtain the RNA structure with the
smallest free energy as an optimal structure [1]. Greedy algorithms and dynamic
programming algorithms were also used to predict the optimal or suboptimal secondary structures [2, 3, 4]. In principle, dynamic programming algorithms can predict
optimal RNA secondary structure with pseudoknots. But in practice, dynamic programming algorithms can be applied to small RNAs only, and cannot be applied to
moderate or large RNAs due to computational complexity of the algorithm.
We have developed a genetic algorithm for predicting RNA secondary structure
with pseudoknots. A genetic algorithm (GA) is a non-deterministic optimization procedure, derived from the concept of biological evolution. A genetic algorithm can
solve an optimization problem, but it cannot guarantee to find optimal result (see
references [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] for previous works on predicting RNA structure using a

genetic algorithm). To assess the optimality of the predictions by our genetic algorithm, we used thermodynamic free energy as well as the number of base pairs of the
predicted structures as fitness functions of the genetic algorithm.
As for the organization of this paper, section 2 describes a genetic algorithm we
developed for predicting RNA structure with pseudoknots. Section 3 discusses the
predicted RNA structures by the genetic algorithm and compares them with those by
a dynamic programming algorithm. Analysis of the results and the general lessons
learned from this study are summarized in the final, Conclusion section.

2 Genetic Algorithm
For RNA structure prediction, we used a steady-state genetic algorithm because its
predictions are known better than others from our previous study [15]. After parsing
an RNA sequence, all possible stems were identified as the initial populations of a
stem pool. Thermodynamic free energy and the weighted value of the number of base
pairs were used as fitness functions. We calculated the value of fitness function in
each structure of initial populations and evolved using a genetic operator. RNA structure is represented in a binary string genome, as shown in Fig. 1. As a terminal condition we used both the number of generations and the convergence of each generation.

2.1 Stem Pool Generation
We generate 3 stem pools after reading a RNA sequence. First we generate all possible stem lists using a covariation matrix. We consider a stem as having minimum 3

132

base pairs. We calculate the stacking energy of each stem in stem lists. We sort the
stem lists in increasing order of their energy values. This is the first stem pool – what
we call “fully zipped stem pool”. We then remove consecutive wobble pairs at both
ends of a stem since these wobble pairs are not stable enough. After removing all
consecutive wobble pairs of each stem at both ends of a stem, we recalculate the
stacking energy and removed irregular stems. This is the second stem pool – what we
call “partially zipped stem pool”. Finally we generate a pseudoknot stem pool by
finding all possible pairs of stems that can form a pseudoknot. At this stage, we consider the number of connecting loops and the size of pseudoknot stems only.
These three stem pools can be selectively used in generating initial populations.
The purpose of building the partially zipped stem pool is to consider all possible partially zipped stems. The pseudoknot stem pool is for predicting RNA structures with
pseudoknots. Without the pseudoknot stem pool, the genetic algorithm predicts secondary structures only.
2.2 Initial Population
We generate structures that include every stem in the stem pools. As mentioned
above, the three stem pools can be used selectively. After choosing a stem from stem
pools, we insert all other stems that can coexist with the chosen stem topologically. If
we use the pseudoknot stem pool, we first select 2 stems from the pseudoknot stem
pool, and insert all possible stems in other stem pools. In topology test, we check
overlapping relation of stems and the type of a pseudoknot. To calculate the free
energy of a H-type pseudoknot we apply the known energy model. For pseudoknots
of other types, we only check the type of the pseudoknots and use topology test in
calculating the free energy of RNA structures. In the example of topology test shown
in Fig. 2, cases of (A) and (C) are considered to fail the test.

3 Method and Results
The genetic algorithm was implemented using C++ builder 5.0 of Inprise Company
on 1.61 GHz Pentium 4 PC with 256 MB memory. To analyze the optimality of the
genetic algorithm, we compared its predictions to the optimal structures predicted by
a dynamic programming algorithm [4].

Since the genetic algorithm is nondeterministic by its nature, we ran the algorithm
many times on a same test case. The mean, minimum, maximum and mode values of
its predictions were used in comparison with the predictions by a dynamic programming algorithm. Different initial populations were tried using the partially zipped
stem pool and fully zipped stem pool.
Fig. 3A shows the known structure Coxsackie B3 virus [11], visualized by PseudoViewer [14]. The structure has a single pseudoknot of nonclassical type. Fig. 3B is
the structure predicted by a dynamic programming algorithm. It does not include a
pseudoknot. Fig. 3C is the structure predicted by our genetic algorithm using thermodynamic free energy as the fitness function and the partially zipped stem pool and
pseudoknot stem pool for initial population.

Figure 4A shows the known structure of TYMV RNA [12], and Fig. 4B is the
structure predicted by a dynamic programming algorithm. It does not include a pseudoknot. Figure 4C is the structure predicted by the genetic algorithm with thermodynamic free energy as the fitness function and the partially zipped stem pool and fully
zipped stem pool for initial population. The structure predicted by the genetic algorithm is topologically similar to the known structure in Fig. 4A When the genetic
algorithm runs with the fully zipped stem pool and the pseudoknot stem pool, its
prediction becomes identical to the known structure.
Table 1 summarizes the analysis of the structures of TYMV and Coxsackie B3 virus predicted by two methods. The two methods were compared with respect to two
measures: number of base pairs and free energy of the predicted structures. The exact
free energy could not be computed for the known structure of Coxsackie since its
pseudoknot structure is not a typical H-type. Although the dynamic programming
algorithm predicted the structure with the smallest free energy value, its predictions
did not include a pseudoknot at all. The genetic algorithm predicted suboptimal structures in terms of free energy, but the predicted structures are closer to known structures because they contain a pseudoknot.

Table 2 summarizes the statistical values of the predictions by several runs of the genetic algorithm. In Table 2, we compare the predictions by the genetic algorithm with
the partially zipped stem pool alone with those with both the partially zipped stem pool
and the fully zipped stem pool. The pseudoknot stem pool was used commonly in both
cases. By using the fully zipped stem pool additionally, we could predict many suboptimal structures, and also more stable structures. But as the size of stem pools increases,
the genetic algorithm takes more time.
The execution time of the genetic algorithm depends on its termination condition: the
number of generations or the convergence of a generation. The convergence of a generation was used to predict the structures shown earlier. Table 3 shows the effect of
changing the number of generations when running the genetic algorithm.

We predicted the TYMV RNA using different numbers of generations. We found
that there is little difference between the case using the convergence and that using the
number of generations and that it converged to the most stable structure early.
We also predicted the RNA structures with long sequences. Longer sequences need
more execution time. The genetic algorithm takes very long when the sequence length
exceeds 300 bases. Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 show the structures of DIGIR1 RNA and TMV
RNA, respectively [1, 13]. Fig. 5A is the known structure of DIGIR1 RNA and Fig. 5B
is the predicted structure by the genetic algorithm. Fig. 6A is the known structure of
TMV RNA with 4 H-type pseudoknots and 6 stems outside the pseudoknots. The genetic algorithm predicted a similar structure to the known structure with free energy as
its fitness function. Both the partially zipped stem pool and the pseudoknot stem pool
were used, but the fully zipped stem pool was not used due to the size of the RNA sequence. The algorithm terminated evolving process using the convergence of populations. The structures shown in Fig. 6B-D were obtained by the genetic algorithm with
different fitness functions. The structure shown in Fig. 6C was predicted by the genetic
algorithm with the weighted value of base pairs as the fitness function instead of energy
value. Both structures of Fig. 6B and Fig. 6D were predicted by the genetic algorithm
with free energy as the fitness function. Fig. 6B had a higher energy value (i.e., less
stable) than the structure of Fig. 6D. The structure of Fig. 6D is the most similar to the
known structure. The known structure of TMV has 14 stems, but 2 of them could not be
generated at initial stage. The structure shown in Fig. 6C was obtained with the weighted
value of base pairs, which is a rough approximation of free energy, but is similar to the
known structure in Fig. 6A. For the structure with nonclassical pseudoknots, the genetic

algorithm performs better with the weighted value of base pairs than with free energy
since the exact energy model is not available for nonclassical pseudoknots.

4 Conclusion
We developed a genetic algorithm for predicting the RNA structures with pseudoknots, and compared the results from using different stem pools and fitness functions.
We also compared the structures predicted by the genetic algorithm to the structures
predicted by a dynamic programming algorithm.
The known RNA structures are often the suboptimal structures in terms of free
energy, and therefore the optimal structures predicted by a dynamic programming
algorithm may not correspond to the known structures. Genetic algorithms do not
guarantee to find optimal structures but often predict better than dynamic programming algorithms. The difficulties of predicting RNA structures using a genetic algorithm come from several things. First, there exist stems of irregular types in natural
RNAs, but all those irregular types cannot be considered during the population generation stage. This means that the quality of the prediction depends on the stem pools
used. Second, no energy model is not available for nonclassical pseudoknots, and the
energy model for H-type pseudoknot is not accurate, either. Therefore, simple and
rough fitness criteria such as the weighted sum of base pairs can be a good fitness
function when the exact energy model associated with nonclassical pseudoknots is not
available.
