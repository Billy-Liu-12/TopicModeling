Abstract. A heterogeneous implementation of the current LCG2/EGEE
grid computing software is supported in the Grid-Ireland infrastructure.
The porting and testing of the current software version of LCG2 is presented for diﬀerent ﬂavours of Linux, namely Red Hat 7.3, Red Hat
9 and Fedora Core 2. The GridBench micro-benchmarks developed in
CrossGrid are used to compare the diﬀerent platforms.

Introduction

Grid-Ireland uses the LCG[1] and EGEE[2] grid middleware, which originally assumed reference ports to Red Hat 7.3 and Microsoft Windows, but subsequently
this has been revised to include Scientiﬁc Linux 3 (SL3). Unfortunately this is
a very restrictive situation, counter to the original heterogeneous ethos of grid
computing. As a result of our interest in heterogeneity, we at Trinity College
Dublin began porting to non-reference platforms in October 2003. Subsequently
EGEE have almost ﬁnished porting the current LCG2 grid implementation to
Scientiﬁc Linux on 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.

Porting for Heterogeneity

The LCG2/EGEE software components are shown in the form of a dependency
graph in Figure 1. Grid-Ireland wished, in the ﬁrst instance, that the porting
of the LCG2 software to other platforms would focus on the ability to execute
Globus and EDG jobs on worker nodes, and that replica management, R-GMA
and VOMS would be supported.
To avail of the base functionality requires Globus and various EDG support
packages. Since Globus 2.4.3 is known to have many bugs, the University of
Wisconsin-Madison corrects these and packages all the necessary components as
part of the Virtual Data Toolkit (VDT) [3]. We have assisted Maarten Litmaath

in CERN to port VDT-1.1.14 to IRIX and Fedora Core 2. A Red Hat 9 port is
already provided by VDT. A port exists for Globus to Mac OS X and AIX but
the VDT version must be ported to both of these platforms.
Grid-Ireland also wished that MPI, replica management and the OpenPBS
client be provided on each worker node. In some cases Torque might be required since newer versions of operating systems are not always provided for in
OpenPBS. Also the R-GMA information system producer and consumer APIs
and the VOMS client were required.

At the moment there is no requirement by Grid-Ireland for the workload
management system (WMS) but it appears that there is logging of WMS events
from worker nodes to the resource broker. This logging activity can be disabled
but we would prefer to retain this desirable feature. WMS consists of many
modules, but it might be able to be refactored to delineate those speciﬁc to the
event logging, so that just this functionality needs to be ported. It should be
noted that if the whole of WMS were ported successfully then almost everything
will have been ported because it depends on so many other packages.
There are a number of on-going issues, but we have successfully ported the
functionality for job submission to Fedora Core 2, IRIX 6.5.14 and 6.5.17m, AIX
5.2L and Red Hat 9. We also plan to do this for Mac OS X v10.3 very soon, and
a number of other platforms if the need arises within Grid-Ireland.

Micro-benchmarking Results

Presently EDG job submission is possible for the following non-reference platforms: SGI IRIX 6.5, Fedora Core 2, Red Hat 7.3 and 9 as described in [4], where
preliminary results using a fast fourier transform (FFT) were used to show differences in computational speed between diﬀerent architectures. A routine such
as a FFT cannot be independently used as a benchmark since it gives no explicit information about I/O, CPU, caching, ﬂoating point or disk write speed.

The CrossGrid GridBench benchmarks[5] developed at the University of Cyprus
provides more precise benchmarking.
GridBench is a tool for benchmarking Grids. It consists of i) the GridBench
Framework and ii) the GridBench Suite. The GridBench framework provides
mechanisms for deﬁning and executing benchmarks as well as archiving and

managing the results. The Gridbench Framework also provides a user-friendly
graphic user interface serving as a “virtual workbench” for conducting Grid
benchmarks and tests. The GridBench Suite provides a set of benchmarks aiming to characterize Grid resources at diﬀerent levels (e.g. the worker-node level
or the cluster level). The Gridbench Framework and Suite are described in [5, 6].
Gridbench is currently being enhanced for fully automating the process of benchmarking heterogeneous resources.

A collaboration between TCD and UCY has resulted in the use of 11 of
the GridBench benchmarks from the GridBench suite. Each of these modules,
along with a suitable job description language (JDL) ﬁle, are required for the
job submission to a single workernode to obtain the benchmark results. Initially
all 11 modules were sent simultaneously as a batch job, but it was found that
the results obtained were inconsistent, with ﬂuctuating wall clock speeds; this
was due to the load tailing oﬀ as the next submitted job arrived on the worker
node. To achieve consistent load between submissions, each job submission must
be staggered in time. The results in Table 1 and Figure 2 were computed on 3
worker nodes with identical hardware speciﬁcations (see Table 2).

Conclusions

The base worker node port of the LCG2/EGEE grid software for Globus and
EDG job submission is now completed for Fedora Core 2, Red Hat 9, IRIX
and AIX. The results presented in Table 1 and 2 show conclusively that Fedora
Core 2 is fastest for write access to the disk (see bonnie in Table 1), while being
slower for computational performance (see cachebench in Fig. 2, epﬂops in Table
1 and HPL in Table 1). In the case of integer computations it is markedly slower
(see epdhrystones in Table 1). Results were also obtained for blasbench and the
gridbench ﬁle transfer benchmark (gbftb) with no noticable diﬀerences.
At ﬁrst the Red Hat 7.3 RPMs were used to perform all the benchmarks on
each Linux platform. To ensure that we could be conﬁdent of the validity of our
results it was necessary to build mpich-1.2.6 and GridBench under Fedora Core
2 using the gcc-3.3.3 compiler. Compiling Gridbench under Fedora Core 2 with
identical optimization options to that of Red Hat 7.3 gave no performance gains.
