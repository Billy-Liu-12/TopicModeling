Abstract. New insights have been gained recently into the interplay
between complex network architectures and the collective dynamics of
simple elements coupled through them. The usual paradigm for studying
systems of this kind is a network of one-dimensional interacting logistic
maps, which provides a plausible model for a variety of complex systems.
In this work we consider a network of two-dimensional standard maps
coupled through a scalefree tree topology. The coupling is solely in the
angle coordinate and involves a time-delay: this approach is motivated
by the node-to-node information ﬂow view of the collective dynamics.
We observe a rich variety of dynamical behavior including self-organized
patterns: nodes synchronize in clusters each having speciﬁc motion quantities whose values are belonging to a discrete set of possible values.
We conclude by studying the relationship between dynamically induced
cluster-organization of the nodes and their network-structurization.

Introduction

Coupled map systems (CMS) like chains, lattices and networks represent the
simplest and most useful paradigm of a complex system: they are conceptually
easy to understand and numerically straightforward to implement [1,2]. Following the pioneering work by Kaneko [3], the collective dynamical properties of
CMS were studied extensively [4,5,6] yielding a lot of insights into the key mechanisms behind the self-organization of complex systems. Moreover, due to the
rich variety of the global qualitative behaviors that CMS posseses, they became
one of the central tools in complex phenomena modeling. For instance, many
systems of biological interest can be plausibly modeled by CMS [7,8,9]; even the
inherent topological details of a given network can be investigated by studying
the dynamics of a CMS interacting through it [10,11].
Despite the simplicity of the local dynamics exhibited by a single map (considered to be a node of the network) their collective behavior usually has completely diﬀerent properties: in particular, for carefully chosen parameter values,
the networks of coupled chaotic maps not only inhibits local chaos on each node,
but manage to fully synchronize in many diﬀerent ways. Extreme robusteness
of the collective functioning of many real networks can also be seen as an intrinsic property of the network-coupled dynamics. Various recent works tried to

model diﬀerent network processes observed in nature using CMS or similarly
simple systems [8,12]: robustness on initial values, speed of self-organization or
network adjustment to a desired ﬁnal behavior. Mostly, these works consider
one-dimensional discrete maps (logistic map or binary maps) to mimic the local
dynamics on a single node and focus on statistics of the emergent behavior.
Even though this approach yielded many results, these models still remain limited to one-dimensional dynamics on each node. However, many networks of interest involve nodes whose local dynamics cannot be modeled by one-dimensional
elements: genes for instance need more then one degree of freedom to be properly modeled; see [13] for an example of a two-gene system. In general, nodes
with larger dimensionality give much richer network behavior as two-dimensional
maps possess a dynamical variety that is already vast. In this contribution we
focus on a network (namely a tree) of coupled 2D maps using the scalefree-tree
topology. We observe a diﬀerent collective properties resulting from the particularities of both coupling and topology. Quite diﬀerently from previous 1D studies,
our network synchronizes after a quick transient for very small values of networkcoupling, achieving a full cluster-synchronization that qualitatively persists even
at higher coupling values. After providing a deﬁnition of cluster-synchronized
states by using the average trajectory power spectrum, we study the relationship between the clustering patterns and the underlying dynamical/topological
details.

The Tree System Set-Up and the Coupled Dynamics

We grow a scalefree-tree network using the standard procedure of preferential
attachment [14] by 1 link/node to obtain a tree with N = 1000 nodes and a
power-law degree distribution with exponent 3. Every node is assumed to have
an internal dynamics given by the 2D standard map [0, 1] × R → [0, 1] × R
x = x + y + ε sin(2πx)
y = y + ε sin(2πx).

[mod 1]

(1)

The nodes are coupled through the network edges by one-step-delay diﬀerence
in angle (x) coordinate so that the complete time-step of the node [i] is
x[i]n+1 = (1 − μ)x [i]n +
y[i]n+1 = (1 − μ)y [i]n .

j∈Ki (x[j]n

− x [i]n )

Here, ( ) denotes the next iterate of the (uncoupled) standard map as in (1), n
denotes the global discrete time and [i] indexes the nodes (ki being a node’s degree); ε and μ are standard map and network-coupling parameters respectively,
and Ki stands for the network neighborhood of the node [i]. The update of each
node is therefore the sum of a contribution given by the update of the node itself
(the part) plus a coupling contribution given by the sum of diﬀerences between
the node’s x-value and the x-values of neighboring nodes in the previous iteration. The study is done on a ﬁxed tree and focused on observing the dynamical

phenomena exhibited by this system in function of the parameter μ (we will
keep ε = 0.9 for the whole study). Of course, the coupling term is somewhat
arbitrary; we choose this particular functional form (2) for two reasons: (i) the
standard map represents a discrete version of an oscillator so the coupling in
angle is natural; (ii) the time-delay models the fact that in realistic networks information exchange needs a ﬁnite time. The standard map [15] is the best-known
example of a chaotic system that exhibits almost all known discrete-time motion
possibilities as ε changes (ε = 0.9 implying a strong chaos). An example of a
standard map trajectory with ε = 0.9 is in Fig.1; its most notable property is
the chaotic diﬀusion – regardless of the initial conditions (x, y) the orbits always
diﬀuse unboundedly along the y axis for ε above the critical value of ε ∼
= 0.15.
The characteristic trajectories of the coupled model are also shown in Fig.1.
Observe that the diﬀusion of the uncoupled map has been inhibited: all the
trajectories are contained in a bounded region (band) in y coordinate once the
transients are gone – they are localized. Even though the motion is still chaotic
within the band, localization is clearly the ﬁrst observed collective eﬀect. Note
that all trajectories in Fig.1 are actually trajectories after ﬁrst 105 iterations
have passed. Since transients are less relevant in this study (we are looking for
the asymptotic properties) from here on they will be disregarded.
With the further increase of μ we witness the localization of trajectories in
smaller and smaller bands and then ﬁnally into a discrete and ﬁnite number of
points (Fig.1 right). Motion here suddenly becomes periodic and fully regular,
characterized also by the band having a width close to 1. Interestingly, once
some nodes start achieving regularity of their motion, all other nodes do it almost simultaneously. There is only a small range in μ within which all the nodes
go from a full chaoticity to a periodic regularity (to be shown in detail later).
This is also visible from Fig.1 which shows qualitatively diﬀerent trajectories

obtained for only a small increase in μ. Also, note that all the network-coupling
values are orders of magnitude smaller than in similar studies of 1D map networks (e.g.[6],[16]). Synergy between 2D maps is clearly stronger then in 1D
case.
A systematic study of the localized trajectory widths leads to the histograms
in Fig.2 left. The curves have a shape of the log-normal distribution for larger
band widths (∼ 100); at the same time the process of localization into periodic
orbits is increasing the number of nodes with band width ∼ 1. This “regularization” of network occurs quite abruptly without a smooth decrease of band
widths; for μ ∼
= 0.018 all the nodes for all choices of initial conditions get localized into periodic orbits. Since this overall property of the trajectories is
robust to initial conditions, we can formalize it by establishing a deﬁnition of
synchronization using the periodicity of the ﬁnal steady states in the section to
come.

The Average Trajectory and the Fourier Transform
Deﬁnition of Synchronization

A convenient object for considering the global properties of a network dynamics
is the average trajectory (a.t.) of the network [6] deﬁned as
(¯
xn , y¯n ) =

which measures the average motion of all the N nodes. When all the nodes
exhibit a periodic motion the a.t. is also periodic, whereas if some of the nodes
are still chaotic the a.t. will be fairly localized but not periodic (Fig.2 right). This
can be quantiﬁed through the Fourier analysis. Let us consider a time-signal of

and its power spectrum |Fk |2 characterises the distribution of periodic components within the corresponding motion. A regular periodic orbit’s spectrum will
therefore be limited to only a few non-zero frequencies whereas a chaotic orbit
will have an (almost) continuous spectrum (Fig.3 left). Since this qualitative
diﬀerence can be quantiﬁed by considering supp(|Fk |2 ) (the portion of the domain with non-zero frequencies), we can now deﬁne a collective dynamics as
synchronized if
(5)
supp(|Fk |2 ) < s0 ,
with some very small s0 . This deﬁnition is not entirely precise but it is very
useful for the numerical study in this work as it gives a good description of the
ﬁnal steady states of our system. Also, supp(|Fk |2 ) can be used as the statistical
order parameter for this system as it sharply decreases to zero when the synchronization starts occurring (Fig.3 right) and stays 0 afterwards. From here
on we will focus on these ﬁnal steady states that fulﬁll the condition (5).

The Cluster Synchronization

Above a particular threshold coupling value μc the tree dynamics reaches a synchronized steady state in which every node has a regular periodic trajectory with
a band width close to 1. A detailed analysis leads to a surprising result that the
nodes actually synchronize in clusters, each cluster having a common value of
the band center. Moreover, the band center values seem to appear only in a discrete set of possible values, as shown in Fig.4 left where the motion of the whole
network is presented. The tree is cluster-synchronized: each cluster is deﬁned by

its band center location which varies less then 1% for the nodes within a cluster.
Band widths (that are now simply twice the amplitude of oscillation) are also
discretized with slightly bigger variance and are close to 1, as expected. This is
shown in Fig.4 right where we see a plot of band widths against band center
locations; note the left-right symmetry of the plot due to the same symmetry
of the initial value interval. This is one of the regularities of the clusterization,
suggesting that it is not a random process. Even though the group of nodes
within a given cluster vary with initial conditions, the ﬁnal qualitative cluster
structure is extremely robust to the initial conditions.
We next show that the synchronized nodes form patterns with more dynamical regularity. In Fig.5 left we show histograms of distances between the nodes
belonging to the same cluster measured along the supporting tree. For comparison we also show lengths of the topological shortest-paths on the same tree. It
appears that the cluster-synchronization aﬀects nodes at distances of 2, 3 and
4, which have statistical weights diﬀerent from the topological distances on that
tree. In this way an intricate structure of the interconnected domains appears
throughout the network (Fig.5 right). This emergent property also seems to be
robust to the variations of the initial conditions.
Another invariant property, although quite common for coupled oscillators,
is that every two linked nodes strongly tend to have diﬀerent oscillation phases
when the tree is synchronized. Regardless of the initial conditions, less then 1
% of the neighboring nodes synchronize in the same phase. Although clustering
eﬀects had already been observed in 1D CMS [17], the clustering observed here
is qualitatively diﬀerent as it includes 2D systems whose synchronization is more
subtle. As for the mechanism behind the clusterization note that the neighboring
nodes tend to oppose their phases due to the time-delay coupling. The diﬀerence
between a node’s x-value and the neighboring nodes’ past x-values is constant
which gives the steady oscillation after transients. The clustering begins as an

accumulation of nodes’ x-values in a way that keeps the x-diﬀerence between
the neighbors close to 0.5, as this produces steadiness (Fig.4 left). This results
in an analogous accumulation of y-values as they are changed solely through
x coordinate, which ﬁnally gives the cluster-synchronized states that are the
invariant orbits for these dynamics.

Conclusions and Outlook

We have shown some preliminary results of the collective dynamics of 2D maps
on a scalefree tree network. Our ﬁndings include self-organizational properties
of the global dynamics achieved after a quick transient. Nodes synchronize into
clusters with speciﬁc dynamical properties even for very small coupling values.
We further demonstrate that the synchronization with the 2D maps leads to
robust dynamical patterns, whose properties can be related to the underlying
tree topology. One direction for further study will be to investigate how these
patterned structures can be used in the network dynamics related to diﬀerent
applications. More open theoretical questions also arise, in particular regarding
the the full extent of the time-delay coupling [18,19], that might be essential in
models of some realistic networks.
