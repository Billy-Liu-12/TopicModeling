Abstract. Considering viscoelastic saturated soil, The transient dynamic
response of an elastic pile is studied. The pile-soil system is divided into thin
layers, the control equations of the soil are solved respectively by using Laplace
transform. Considering the mixed boundary-value conditions at the interface of
pile and soil, expression is derived to describe the relationship between the inner
force and the displacement of the pile segment. Then the expressions of all pile
segments are integrated to form the stiffness matrix of pile. Considering the
transient torsional loading at the pile head, the pile displacement in time domain
is calculated by numerical method, with the result showing the influence of
various pile parameters.
Keywords: poroelastic medium; viscidity; elastic pile; transient dynamic
response.

Wide attention has been paid to the research on the dynamic response of pile
foundations. Novak [1, 2] has studied pile’s torsional vibration and revealed the
fundamental characteristics of the interaction between the pile and the surrounding soil.
Zeng [3], Jin [4] and Cai[5] have
studied the time harmonic response of

task. Militano [6] have studied the
dynamic response of an elastic pile
subjected to transient torsional and
axial loading. It should be noted that no
work on transient torsional response of
a pile embedded in poroelastic soil has

been reported in literature. The main
objective of this paper is to present the dynamic response of an elastic pile embedded in
saturated soil under transient torsional loading (Fig. 1), and the viscidity of soil is
considered too. The influence of parameters of pile and soil is clarified from the
numerical computation results.

1 Basic Equations and Solution
The soil is divided into k thin layers, and the equilibrium equation of the soil layer
corresponding to torsional loading can be expressed as:

∂σ rθ ∂σ θ z
σ
∂ 2u
∂ 2 wθ
+

where σ rθ , σ θ z are shear stresses of soil; ρ = (1 − n) ρ s + n ρ w , ρ s , ρ w signify the
densities of the solid phase and the fluid phase respectively; uθ , wθ denote the
displacements of the solid phase and the fluid phase in the θ -direction respectively.
The Voigt-Kelvin model is adopted to describe the viscidity of soil. The constitutive
equations are:
(2)
σ rθ = Gε rθ + G ′εrθ

σ θ z = Gεθ z + G ′εθ z

Militano [6] studied the transient torsional response of a pile embedded in elastic soil
by neglecting the gradient of σ rθ in the vertical direction. Following a similar
assumption and considering the viscidity of soil, Equation (1) can be expressed in terms
of uθ ( r , t ) as:

⎛ ∂ 2 u 1 ∂uθ uθ ⎞
∂ 2u
∂ 2 wθ

In Equation (18), T 0 is the dimensionless loading in Laplace transform domain. T k
is the moment extended by soil at the bottom of the pile, and is assumed to be equal to
the static stiffness corresponding to a rigid disk of radius R attached to the surface of
an elastic half space. Considering the viscidity of soil, the base stiffness of the pile can

Equation (18) can be solved numerically.

3 Numerical Results and Discussions
The solving process is carried in the Laplace transform domain. And the numerical
inverse transform should be used to achieve the final result in the time domain. The
numerical Laplace inversion transform method proposed by Durbin[7] is adopted in
this paper:

where S , a , NSUM are transform parameters. The values: S = 20 , a = 0.75 ,
NSUM = 50 are accurate enough.
Two types of loading are adopted in the numerical procedure as shown as Fig. 3, one
is the rectangular pulse and the other is the triangular pulse. The non-dimensional twist
angles ϕ ′ ( z ) = ϕ ( z ) G T0 are calculated to illustrate the influence of various factors.
Some properties of poroelastic material and pile are n = 0.4 , ρ s = 2650 kg m3 ,

ρ w = 1000 kg m3 , ρ b = 1.3 , t 0 = 2 .
Fig. 4( l R = 15 , kd = 10−7 m/s , η = 0 ) shows the displacement of the pile head in
the time domain, part (a) and part (b) show the dynamic responses of elastic pile with
different G p under the rectangular pulse and the triangular pulse respectively ( ϕ0′
denotes the non-dimensional displacement of the pile head). The results indicate

that the displacement is oscillating in the time domain, and is close to zero finally. Each
curve has an obvious peak value varying with different G p . The pile head
displacement increases with the reduction of the pile’s Young’s modulus. Under two
types of loading, the response curves are alike. But the pile head displacement is small
under triangular pulse, and the trends are different at the initial stages.
The displacement responses of the surrounding soil for different shear modulus of
pile are also taken into consideration. Time histories of the non-dimensional
displacement of soil around the pile are depicted in Fig.5. ( kd = 10−7 m/s , η = 0 ). It’s
found that a flexible pile ( G p = 100 ) causes larger soil responses than a stiffer pile
( G p = 500 ). And for a stiffer pile, the generated surface wave can not propagate as far
as that of a flexible pile.
By changing the soil viscidity, computation results of the non-dimensional twist
angle at the pile head are presented in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 ( kd = 10−7 m/s ) for G p with

values of 100 and 500 respectively. The results show that the soil viscidity remarkably
affects the response amplitudes at the pile head, and the bigger value of η leads to the
smaller amplitude of twist angle. Also, it is found that the increasing of the soil
viscidity causes a time lag for the occurrences of response peaks at pile head. In the
range of η taken into account, only when the pile is stiff ( G p = 500 ) the change of
slenderness ratio of pile will cause a difference in the response that can be noticed.

4 Conclusion
Analytical method was developed to study the transient dynamic response of an elastic
pile embedded in a homogeneous poroelastic medium and subjected to transient
torsional loading. Numerical method was used to calculate the elastic pile twist angle,
and the conclusions were obtained as follows:
1) Compared with the triangular load, the rectangular step torque causes larger pile
displacement.
2) The non-dimensional shear modulus affects substantially the pile transient response,
the peak twist angle of pile decreases with the increasing of pile stiffness.

3) The flexible pile contributes more to the surrounding surface soil than the stiffer
pile.
4) The bigger value of η leads to the smaller amplitude of twist angle, and the
increasing of soil viscidity causes a time lag for the occurrences of response
peaks at the pile head.
