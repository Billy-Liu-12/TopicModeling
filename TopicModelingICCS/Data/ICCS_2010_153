Abstract
The paper presents results of numerical simulation of laminar and turbulent weakly ionized plasma flows around model bodies
under MHD interaction.
Numerical investigations have been carried out of supersonic MHD flow of weakly ionized nitrogen plasma around model bodies
(spherically blunted cylinder, truncated cylinder, and cone-cylinder lay-outs) at conditions of experiments on the Big Shock Tube
(BST) of the Ioffe Institute of Russian Academy of Sciences. The purpose of the investigations was verification of a
mathematical model and algorithm as well as analysis of predominant factors determining the MHD impact on the flow structure
and thermal load on the model. The effect of the magnetic field induced by the coil installed in the model on the plasma flow was
investigated and the efficiency of the MHD interaction was estimated. To enhance the efficiency of the MHD interaction a
surface electric discharge was arranged between an electrode installed on the model nose and a ring coaxial electrode installed in
the vicinity of the cone-cylinder conjugation. In the magnetic field induced by the coil the discharge rotates producing a domain
of high plasma electric conductivity near the cone surface. Comparison of the predictions with experimental data obtained on the
BST was presented.
Thus the considered system is typical muliphysics and multiscale one involving interaction of supersonic flow with the
electromagnetic field, description of large eddies evolution, turbulence model for subgrid scale, and effects of localized electric
discharge. Investigations showed that at conditions under study the predominant factors of MHD impact on weakly ionized
plasma flow around the body determining the flow structure are both the ponderomotive force and the Joule heating.

and algorithm as well as analysis of major factors determining the MHD impact on the flow. The effect of the
magnetic field induced by the coil built-in the body on the plasma flow was investigated and the efficiency of the
MHD interaction was estimated. In particular, supersonic flow about various model bodies including spherically
blunted and truncated cylinders, as well as cone-cylinder with electric discharge rotating in the induced magnetic
field on the cone surface between one electrode located on the cone apex and annular another one at the conecylinder conjugation [1] was considered. In this case the incoming flow parameters correspond to the Big Shock
Tube setup of the Ioffe Institute. The electric discharge increases dramatically the electric conductivity of the gas in
the vicinity of the cone surface and therefore intensifies the MHD interaction. Special attention was paid to
determination of the thermal loading on the body and comparison of results with experimental data on heat flux
measurements with the gradient heat flux sensors (GHFS).
Besides, supersonic weakly ionized plasma flows about blunted and truncated cylinders were simulated with the
developed mathematical model [2].
The investigation showed that at the conditions under study the predominant factors of MHD impact on weakly
ionized plasma flow around the body determining the flow structure are both the ponderomotive force and the Joule
heating. It is worth to be mentioned that in a wide range of incoming plasma flow parameters the flow around the
body is turbulent one which also significantly influences the flow structure.
Results of numerical simulation of weakly ionized plasma flows around blunted and truncated cylinders and
cone-cylinder bodies under MHD interaction are presented.
2. Mathematical model
A simple but robust hydrodynamic model is used considering the plasma as a neutral electric conducting
continuum. Evolution of such a medium is described by equations of magnetic hydrodynamics. The following
assumptions are accepted: the MHD interaction is taken into account within the framework of the MHD approach
neglecting the induced magnetic field. Validity of these assumptions follows from the inequalities

V0  c,

L V0 !! Z p1 ,

Re m  1

which certainly hold for the flows under study. Here, lD is the Debye length, L is the flow length scale, V0 is the flow
velocity scale, c is the light speed, »¶p is the plasma frequency, Rem is the magnetic Reynolds number.
Under these assumptions governing equations may be written as follows:

At this stage of the investigations the plasma viscosity, heat conductivity and specific heat are computed from
kinetic theory while the electric conductivity is supposed to be constant.
To close the above set of the equations appropriate model of turbulence should be implemented into the
algorithm. In this study turbulence effects were considered using the Spalart-Allmaras model [3] and a Large Eddy
Simulation with Smagorinsky model for subgrid scale.
At the inflow boundary all plasma parameters are prescribed. On the body surface the non-slip conditions are
imposed. As it has been shown in the BST experiments, the temperature of the walls is constant during the BST
operation time, so, heat fluxes on the body surface are calculated at constant temperature of the surface. On the
outflow boundary the conditions wf/wn = 0 are used where n is the unit vector normal to this boundary. The body
material is supposed to be insulator.
3. Numerical method

Stationary solution is obtained using time-asymptotic technique with an implicit high resolution algorithm
providing the second order accuracy with respect to the spatial coordinates in the flow regions with smooth function
behavior. The method is conservative shock capturing one which is necessary in computations of supersonic flows
with various non-uniformities, shock waves, etc.
Block-structured computational mesh was used providing refinement in domains of stiff gradients of gasdynamic
functions. An example of the meshes for model bodies is presented in Fig. 1.

In Figs. 2 (a, b, c) distributions of the pressure, the Mach number and the plasma temperature are shown in the
vicinity of the body in case of MHD interaction. Magnetic coil is installed in sphere-cylinder conjugation plane, as it
is shown in Fig. 2(a), and contains only one loop. Parameters of the incoming flow are: B0 = 1…å, V | 103 S/m, here
B0 is characteristic value of the magnetic induction in the coil center. The incoming flow Mach number, …Ü = 3,
pressure and temperature correspond to the normal conditions. Turbulence of incoming flow is defined by viscosity
ratio equal to 5.0.
At considered conditions the only visible effects of the MHD interaction are the local pressure maximum near the
coil and subsonic flow domain with hot gas located downstream the coil which thickness is significantly greater then
the boundary layer one. The value of the pressure maximum is significantly less than the pressure near the
stagnation point. The bow shock wave does not change its shape and location.
The presented results demonstrate that at parameters under study (Incoming flow parameters, coil geometry and
placing and magnetic field intensity) it is impossible to influence the shock structure of the flow.
Figs. 3 (a, b, c) show distributions of the pressure, the Mach number, and the temperature for supersonic turbulent
plasma flow with MHD interaction near the truncated cylinder with magnetic coil installed under cylinder surface.
Free flow parameters are: M=8.6, p=4.47 Pa, T=180 K, V|102 S/m. Magnetic field at the center of the body is about
0.6 …å. It is clearly visible that under such conditions and coil configuration magnetic field impacts heavily on the
flow structure which reveals in strong shock wave deformation.

installed in the cone-cylinder conjugation plane. Electrodes are installed on the nozzle of the body and on the top of
the body near the conjugation plane. It is seen that at chosen arrangement of the induction coil domain of maximum
MHD interaction is localized in the vicinity of the cone-cylinder conjugation where the induction of the magnetic
field reaches 30 T, while near the cone tip the induction is about zero. It is worth to be mentioned that in spite of
significantly non-uniform distribution of the magnetic field induction (with highly localized maximum in the
vicinity of the cone-cylinder conjugation) the domain of efficient MHD interaction is stretched near all surface of
the cone due to high density of the electric current in the discharge. The turbulence manifests itself mainly in
dynamic and thermal load on the body. Under considered conditions the MHD interaction results in noticeable
decrease of the Mach number near the body, which is mainly due to temperature increase and flow deceleration
because of the Joule heating and the ponderomotive force effect. Expansion of the temperature layer leads to
increase of the head shock wave inclination, as well as to expansion of the boundary layer on the cylinder.

In Fig. 6(a, b) distributions of the heat flux on two different bodies are presented. The first one shows behavior of
the heat flux on the cone-cylinder body with and without MHD interaction. Computational data are compared with
data obtained from experiments which were held on BST setup in Physical Technical Institute. Experimental and
computational data are in good agreement with each other, both turbulence models (Spalart-Allmaras (S-A TM) and
Large Eddy Simulation (LES TM)) show good robustness and accuracy for both regimes. In Fig. 6 (b) heat flux on
truncated cylinder are shown. The absolute value of the heat flux is lower in this case than in previous one because
of absence of the electric discharge near the body surface which can significantly increases conductivity and,
therefore, heat flux on the body.
5. Conclusion

Thus, the formulated mathematical model and the numerical method were implemented to simulate 3D laminar
and turbulent supersonic weakly ionized nitrogen flows around cone-cylinder body under the MHD impact. Such a
modification which enables one to investigate essentially non-stationary processes is necessary to account for
dynamics of discharge rotation. In the cases under study efficient MHD interaction provided by the rotating
discharge near the cone surface in the magnetic field leads to significant increase of the wall heat flux on the
cylinder surface which is mainly due to the Joule heating. It was demonstrated that formulated simple mathematical

model is able to predict the main features of MHD flow structure. Future work will be focused on development of an
electric discharge model.
