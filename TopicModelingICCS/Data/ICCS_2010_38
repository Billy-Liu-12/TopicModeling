Abstract
A new approach is described to the evaluation of the quantum scattering S-matrix in 3D atom-diatom reactive
collision. The theory is developed in terms of natural collision coordinates where the coordinate reaction fulﬁlls the
same role as a time in a time-dependent scattering formulation. Having written the full wavefunction of the particles
system in the coupled-channel representation we have proved that the 3D multi-channel scattering problem can be
reduced to the inelastic single-arrangement problem which is described by system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
(ODE) of second order. The system of coupled-channel second order ODEs exactly is reduced to the system of
integro-diﬀerential equations (IDE) of ﬁrst order which is solved with the initial conditions. The problem of Koshi for
the system of IDEs is proposed to be solved by the method of Runge-Kutta of fourth order. The detailed algorithm for
parallel simulation of initial 3D scattering problem is proposed. In result of simulation of IDEs the full wavefunction
and all S-matrix elements of reactive transitions and state-to-state cross section are obtained simultaneously without
other extra calculations.

1. introdaction
Accurate quantum dynamics approaches have made an immense impact on the theory of elementary atom-molecule
collisions [1, 2, 3]. Recent advances in accurate quantum mechanical calculations on simple few atom systems have
demonstrated the possibility of obtaining detailed information concerning chemical reactions from ﬁrst principles
[4, 5, 6]. Tremendous progress has occurred in developing and applying both time-independent and time-dependent
quantum dynamics approaches the last few years.
At present there are three common approaches used in the quantum reactive scattering ﬁeld:

3. The variational methods based on the simultaneous use of mass-scaled Jacobi coordinates in each of the chemical arrangements involved [9, 10].
Despite the successful applications to polyatomic systems mentioned above, general applications still appear to be extremely diﬃcult. Quantum mechanics is nonlocal in character and numerical eﬀorts to solve the Schr¨odinger equation
increase exponentially with the number of degrees of freedom. State resolved accurate quantum dynamical calculations are presently limited to at most seven-dimensional problems [14]. Thus, the development of new conceptual
approaches permitting improved computational algorithms for direct quantum simulations is of great interest.
Earlier natural collision coordinates NCC allowing an analytical investigation of chemical reactivity in collinear
collisions was introduced by Marcus [15] and further explored by Light [16]. Light and coworkers [17] generalized
the NCC approach to three-dimensional atom-diatom reactive scattering and on this basis they studied H + H2 system
and its isotopomers in 3D for total angular momentum J = 0 [18].
Due to diﬃculties in applying the NCC approach, attention turned to other coordinate systems. Nevertheless, it
seems to us that the primary idea of NCC, namely to simplify 3D quantum reactive scattering calculations, can be
realized. Particularly, one of the authors has shown that for collinear three-body collisions, it is possible to constructing
the S-matrix exactly, in simple form [19, 20].
The generalization of our previous collinear NCC quantum scattering approach to a full 3D treatment was made in
the article [21]. In the present work on the basis of developing quantum scattering theory a new algorithm for parallel
modelling of atom-diatom reactions is proposed.
2. The Shr¨odinger equation of reactive scattering and transition S-matrix elements
The reactive scattering process in a three-body system can be described by the scheme:
A + (BC) −→ (ABC)∗ −→ (AB) + C

where A, B, and C are atoms, and characterize the sets of quantum numbers of diatomic states corresponding to
initial (in) and ﬁnal (out) scattering channels, (ABC)∗ denotes an activated complex which may or may not be present
as an intermediary species.
Quantum scattering in the three-body system after separation of external rotation in the NCC system (intrinsic
coordinates system (u, v, θ) ) has the following form:

3. The coupled-channel method and derivation of matrix equation for S-matrix elements
Let us remember that along the coordinate u the system performs the translational motion, while along the coordinates v and θ the motions of bodies system are localized. Taking into account this fact we can employ the
time-independent coupled-channel (CC) approach and write down the full wavefunction in the following form:

where describes the set of initial quantum numbers of three-bodies system.
The vibrational part of the wavefunction Ξn( j) (v; u) forms an orthonormal basis by the variable v in each ﬁxed
value of coordinate u (see below (15)) and satisﬁes the equation:

where the function U(u, v) is a some 2D eﬀective potential which in the limit of u → ∓∞ coincides with the 1D
potentials of (in) and (out) asymptotic states correspondingly. The equation (11) describes the exact motions of bound
states in asymptotic channels.
Taking into account (1) and (11) we can obtain the following system of second order ordinary diﬀerential equations

Recall that this condition provides transition of full wavefunction to its asymptotic kind.
Now we can obtain the clear expression for the S-matrix elements using the representation (10) for the full wavefunction. After substituting (10) into expression (6) for the ﬁxed quantum number J we obtain:
p+n¯ ( ¯j )

get that limu→+∞ Wn n (u) = δn n which allows us to ﬁnd for S- matrix elements the following expression:

Thus the system of diﬀerential equations (12)-(13) describes the evolution of the full wavefunction in the conﬁguration space, at the same time solving it in the limit u → +∞ we obtain all S-matrix elements of reactive transitions.
4. The system of integro-diﬀerential equations of ﬁrst order and method Runge-Kutta for its solution
The matrix equation (12)-(13) has 2N linearly independent solutions. There are several standard ways in which
this system of ordinary diﬀerential equations can be solved and all of these are based on various modiﬁcations of the
R-matrix method [3, 22, 23, 24]. Let us remind ourselves that in using the R-matrix method arise a question of the
ﬁrst derivative which at the numerical solution of the equations generates instability and is problematic. In addition, in
this case there are additional computing problems which are connected with the problem of lacing of parts of special
coordinate system and computation of transition S-matrix elements. For overcoming these diﬃculties diﬀerent ways
were suggested, but nevertheless the method was not attractive, especially not for application to multidimensional
scattering problems.
Let us present the solutions of matrix equation (12) in the kind:

Substituting expression (18) into matrix equation (12) we ﬁnd the following system of the integro-diﬀerential equations:
d

(19)

where X(u) = {X[ ] (u)} denote the set of matrix elements, in addition:

(u) = √ exp −ip−n ( j) u − p−n ( j) δ

− ip−n ( j) A (u) + B (u) .

Thus, the system of the integro-diﬀerential equations (19) describes quantum dynamics of bodies system. Now our
problem consists in a choice of a suitable method for simulation of matrix diﬀerential equation (19)-(20) with the
initial condition (Koshi problem):
= 0.
(21)
X[ ] (u)
u→−∞

Algorithm of numerical integration of the matrix equation (19)-(21) which is based on method Runge-Kutta is
more complicated however this method from the point of view of an error’s control of calculation is more reliable.
Based on Runge-Kutta method of 4th order the diﬀerence form of matrix equation (19)-(20) we can write in the
following kind [25, 26]:

Finally conducting the iterative simulations by equations (22)- (24) on a grid of points {ui } we can continue solution of
matrix equations (19) from (in) asymptotic state to the (out) asymptotic state. It is important to note, that at calculation
i−1
of sums Y[ ] (ui−1 )
j=0 X[ ] (u j ) h j we can calculate full wavefunction of bodies system in the passing points ui
and in the limit u → +∞ or in the point uN where N >> 1, all S-matrix elements of transitions (see Exp.s (17) and
(18)).
5. The properties of reaction potential and simpliﬁcation of system of integro-diﬀerential equations
The approximate quantity of the integro-diﬀerential equations which are necessary to solve for obtaining a full
information on elementary chemical reaction, an order of n × j × K, that is very big ∼ 106 . For simpliﬁcation of
simulation problem it is useful to investigate the properties of coeﬃcients of equation (12).
As was shown by the authors [27], the reaction potential may be represented in NCC system in the following way:
M

V j (u, v)P j (cos θ),

U(u, v, θ)

(25)

j=0

where M < ∞ shows the minimal number of terms which provide the necessary accuracy of the interaction potential
of reacting three-body system, the analytical kinds of functions V j (u, v) are being found in the result of ﬁtting of 3D
numerical array for the reaction potential.
In particular, for the case of generalized collinear collision (when taking into account a rotation force, see (11))
it was shown that the bound states are well described by the wavefunction of generalized Morse potential (i.e. with
respect to the variable v function U(u, v, θ = 0) is the Morse potential, while along the variable u it is an adiabatically
changing function). For a case of noncollinear collision, the functions V j (u, v) are selected thus which allow to carry
out analytical integration of the terms U Kjj (u, v) into the equations (12)-(13).
Thus with the help of representation of the interaction potential in the kind (25) all coeﬃcients in the Eqs. (12)
and also in the Eqs. (19)-(20) are deﬁned analytically. In particular, by detailed analysis is shown that the coeﬃcients
A (u) and B (u) depends from diﬀerence of quantum numbers exponentially:
A

(u) ∝ e−||

−

||

,

B

(u) ∝ e−||

−

||

,

(26)

where and
are vectors in the 3D discrete space of quantum numbers, ||.|| denotes a norm of vector. Taking
into account the fact that ||G[ ] (u)|| ∼ ||X[ ] (u)|| < 1 and also relations (26) we can substantially to reduce the
dimensionality of Eqs. system (19)-(20).
6. The sequential computational scheme of transitions S-matrix elements
For simulation of 3D quantum reactive scattering in NCC system the grid technology and parallel computation is
used. The algorithm consists of the following successive and parallel steps;
1. Fitting of the 3D reaction potential U(u, v, θ) in the NCC system,
2. Fitting of the potential for the collinear reaction with taking into account rotation of bodies system by generalized Morse function,
3. Symbolic calculations of the eigenvalues and the eigenfunctions of the one-dimensional Shr¨odinger equation
for the generalized Morse potential on the grid of points {uN } ∈ i f (see equation (11)),
4. Symbolic calculations of the analytical forms of coeﬃcients A (u) and B (u) in the equation of scattering
(12), using calculations of the ﬁrst two steps,
5. Iterative calculation of the matrix integro-diﬀerential equation (19) by Runge-Kutta method of 4th order (see
ui−1
formulas (22)-(24)) on a grid of points {uN }, calculation of integrals Y[ ] (ui−1 ) = −∞ X[ ] (u ) du
i−1
j=0 X[ ] (u j ) h j and reconstruction of full wavefunction (see formula (10) ) on the mentioned grid,
6. Computation of the transitions S-matrix elements (see exprssions (17)-(18) ) and the diﬀerential state-to-state
cross section of elementary reactive processes by formula (8),

7. Parallel computation of the integrated cross section of elementary reactive processes by formula (9).
Thus we have shown that the problem of 3D atom-diatom quantum reactive scattering in the NCC system can be reduced to the problem of simulation of the matrix integro-diﬀerential equation of the ﬁrst order, which can be calculated
by Runge-Kutta method of the 4th order.
7. Conclusion
Let us note that the discussed way of solution of quantum 3D reactive scattering in the three-body system from
the mathematical point of view is an eﬀective and correspondingly an optimal way for the numerical simulation. In
comparison with other well-known computation schemes the proposed scheme is optimal and clear for realization.
Recall that the elementary atom-diatom reactions in nature are extremely varying and it is possible that in some cases
the matrix integro-diﬀerential equation (19)-(21) can be stiﬀ. In the mentioned case the solution of Koshi problem in
the framework of Runge-Kutta method of 4th order may be nonstable. For the solution of the nonlinear problem of
the general kind, eqns (19)-(21), we can use a multiple-valued stiﬀ-steady method of variable order (Gear method)
[28, 29]. In the case of the weak nonlinearity the problem can be eﬀectively solved in the framework of A-stability
method of Louson, the explicit variant of the Runge-Kutta method [29].
In any case the investigation of a test problems, H + H2 , H + D2 , D + H2 , and other reactions with participation of
isotopes of the hydrogen atoms will allow choosing a ﬁnal method for creation of new eﬀective package for numerical
simulation of bimolecular reactions.
