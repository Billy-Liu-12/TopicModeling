Abstract. We show how a lattice Boltzmann (LB) scheme can be spatially coupled with a ﬁnite diﬀerence (FD) scheme in order to solve the
same problem. The typical situation we consider is a computational domain which is partitioned in two regions. The same spatio-temporal physical process extends over the full domain but a diﬀerent numerical method is used over each region. At the interface of the subdomains, the
LB and FD must be connected so as to ensure a perfect continuity of
the physical quantities. We derive the theoretical concepts, which allow
us to link both methods in the case of a diﬀusion process, and validate
them with numerical simulations on a 2D domain.

Introduction

Many physical systems include phenomena at diﬀerent time and space scales.
Their description in terms of a numerical model is therefore a diﬃcult task as
often the same numerical scheme is not eﬃcient over the full range of scales. In
addition, it occurs that various physical processes take place and couple diﬀerent
parts of the system. Again, it is challenging to devise a numerical method which
is able to eﬃciently deal with such constraints.
Here we consider the case of a spatially extended system in which separate
spatial regions are treated with diﬀerent numerical schemes. The motivation is
that, depending on the nature of each region, optimal eﬃciency is obtained with
diﬀerent numerical methods.
For instance the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method [1] has a more detailed
microscopic description than a ﬁnite diﬀerence (FD) scheme because the LB approach includes the molecular velocity of the particles. In addition, important
physical quantities, such as the stress tensor, or particle current, are directly
obtained from the local information. However, the LB scheme may require more
memory than the corresponding FD scheme. Another motivation is that boundary conditions are more or less naturally imposed on a given numerical scheme.
Therefore, in order to improve the global quality of the numerical solution, it
may be quite eﬃcient to assume that several solvers are coupled.
Obviously, this coupling should not produce any discontinuities at the interface between regions that are treated with the LB or the FD method. Since each

scheme uses diﬀerent variables, it is crucial to understand how the LB set of
variables is related to the FD set, and conversely.
Our solution follows the same argument as developed in [2] for a multigrid
LB scheme: the connection between the full set of LB variables and the standard
macroscopic physical quantities is based on the splitting of the particle distribution functions in an equilibrium and a nonequilibrium part. The former is built
on the physical quantities and the latter on the gradient of these quantities. This
observation is quite general and could be used to couple any scheme (e.g. ﬁnite
volume or ﬁnite element) with any LB method. Indeed, if the two schemes use
diﬀerent variables, one must compute the particle distribution functions starting from physical quantities known from another solver or from an analytical
expression. Here we will only consider the case of a diﬀusion process on a given
domain which is solved by the LB approach on a chosen subdomain and with a
FD solver on the rest of the domain.
Hybrid methods have already been proposed in the literature. In [3] a ﬁnite
volume and a ﬁnite element method are combined and then coupled with a ﬁnite
diﬀerence time domain solver for the wave equation, allowing the simulation of
wave propagation in complex 3D geometry. In [4], the LB method is coupled
with a molecular dynamics simulation of polymers. However, to our knowledge,
the FD and LB schemes have never been coupled across adjacent regions.
The paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we brieﬂy introduce the LB
approach (we assume that the reader is familiar with the FD method). The
special case of a diﬀusion process is discussed in section 3. In particular, it
is shown how the Chapman-Enskog expansion oﬀers a mapping between the
LB variables and the macroscopic quantities and their spatial derivatives. In
section 4 we describe the coupling algorithm. Then, in section 5 we perform
a numerical simulation to demonstrate that the proposed coupling is correct.
Finally, section 6 summarizes our ﬁndings and draws some conclusions.

The Lattice Boltzmann Approach

A lattice Boltzmann (LB) model [1,5] describes a physical system in terms of
a mesoscopic dynamics: ﬁctitious particles move on a regular lattice, synchronously at discrete time steps. An interaction is deﬁned between the particles
that meet simultaneously at the same lattice site. Particles obey collision rules
which reproduce, in the macroscopic limit, an equation of physics.
A LB model can be interpreted as a discretization of the Boltzmann transport
equation on a regular lattice of spacing ∆r and with discrete time step ∆t. The
possible velocities for the pseudo-particles are the vectors v i . They are chosen
so as to match the lattice direction: if r is a lattice site, r + v i ∆t is also a lattice
point. We thus consider a dynamics with z + 1 possible velocities, where z is the
lattice coordination number and v 0 = 0 describe the population of rest particles.
For isotropy reasons the lattice topology must satisfy the conditions
viα = 0
i

viα viβ = v 2 C2 δαβ

and
i

where C2 is a numerical coeﬃcient which depends on the lattice topology. The
greek indices label the spatial dimensions and v = ∆t/∆r. The ﬁrst condition
follows from the fact that if v i is a possible velocity, then so is −v i .
In the LB approach a physical system is described through density distribution functions fi (r, t). For hydrodynamics and diﬀusion processes, fi (r, t) represents the distribution of particles entering site r at time t and moving in
direction v i . For the wave model, the interpretation is less obvious as fi can be
positive as well as negative. Physical quantities can be deﬁned from moments of
z
these distributions. For instance, the local density is obtained by ρ = i=0 fi .
A LB model can be determined by specifying a lattice, a kinetic equation and
an equilibrium distribution. In its simplest form (BGK model), the dynamics can
be written as a relaxation to a given local equilibrium
fi (r + v i ∆t, t + ∆t) − fi (r, t) =

1 eq
(f (r, t) − fi (r, t))
τ i

(2)

where τ is a relaxation time, which is a free parameter of the model. The local
equilibrium solution fieq contains all the information concerning the physical process investigated. It changes according to whether we consider hydrodynamics,
diﬀusion or wave propagation.

The Lattice Boltzmann Diﬀusion Model

Diﬀusion processes were ﬁrst modeled using a cellular automata approach [6].
The scheme was then extended to a LB dynamics with a BGK collision term [1,
5,7].
From now on, we assume that the diﬀusion process takes place on a ddimensionnal square lattice. The key point is to choose correctly the local equi2d
librium fieq so that the diﬀusion equation for the particle density ρ = i=0 fi
can be derived from eq. (2). Since the particle density ρ is the only conserved quantity in a diﬀusive process, the local equilibrium fieq is taken to be
fieq (r, t) = ρ(r, t)/2d so that ρ is indeed conserved and fieq depends on r and t
only through the conserved quantities [1,5].
Let us now assume that ∆t is small (and constant in all our computations).
Taylor expanding the left hand side of eq. (2) up to second order, we get

(3)

We then use the multiscale Chapman-Enskog expansion to solve eq. (3). Thus, we

(1)
(2)
set fi = fi +fi +fi +. . . and introduce next a small parameter along with
the change of coordinates (r, t) → (r 1 , t1 , t2 ) = ( r, t, 2 t). We also consider a
new function fi (r 1 , t1 , t2 ) which satisﬁes fi (r, t) = fi ( r, t, 2 t) . After formally
substituting fi −→ fi , ∇r −→ ∇r1 , ∂t −→ ∂t1 + 2 ∂t2 , into eq. (3), we obtain
a new equation for fi .

It is still worth noticing, with respect to the macrocospic behaviour of our model,
that the particle density ρ(r, t) satisﬁes the diﬀusion equation. Indeed, using the
second equation in (1), we get
∂t ρ(r, t) =

These relations give a dictionary to go from the standard description of diﬀusion, where only ρ is considered, to the LB description. Note that the inverse
connection is straightforward since we always have, by deﬁnition, ρ = i fi . It
must be clear that the LB scheme requires more information on the physical
variables because it contains more degrees of freedom.
To make the coupling between a FD and a LB scheme more explicit, we now
consider the situation of a two-dimensional diﬀusion problem ∂t ρ = D∇2 ρ on a
square domain Ω ⊂ R2 of size Lx × Ly . We cut Ω into two parts Ω1 and Ω2 such
that Ω = Ω1 Ω2 . We apply in Ω1 the FD method and in Ω2 the LB method
(see ﬁg. 1). We assume here that the same mesh is used for both methods.
We deﬁne the quantities v i , i = 1, ..., 4, as vectors pointing in the four lattice
directions: right, up, left and down. Their lengths are such that v i ∆t connects
the neighboring sites along direction i.
For the points r ∈ Ω1 , we apply the FD scheme to the diﬀusion equation

whereas the points r ∈ Ω2 are treated with the LB scheme given by eq. (2).
There are several ways to deﬁne the interface between the two regions, Ω1 and

Fig. 1. Left: The computational grid and its partioning into a subdomain Ω1 , where
the FD scheme is applied, and a subdomain Ω2 , where the LB scheme is used. The
boundary conditions we impose for the diﬀusion process are ρ = 10 on the left wall,
ρ = 0 on the right one and periodic along the vertical axis. Right: The point r 1 (white
circle), resp. r 2 (black circle), is completely treated with the FD, resp. LB, scheme,
and r 0 (gray circle) is updated with both methods. The ﬁgure shows that for r 0 ,
the distribution f1 is unknown (because it should come out of r 1 ). Thus, we use our
coupling algorithm to compute it

Ω2 . Here, we assume an overlap so that a point r 0 at the interface belongs to
both Ω1 and Ω2 (see ﬁg. 1). On such points r 0 , the LB variables as well as the
FD variables are computed. We denote by r 1 ∈ Ω1 and r 2 ∈ Ω2 , two neighbors
of a site r 0 of the interface. According to ﬁg. 1 and eq. (5), the calculation
of ρ(r 0 , t + ∆t) requires the knowledge of ρ(r 2 , t), where r 2 is only subject
to the LB scheme. However, the LB scheme oﬀers naturally this quantity as
4
ρ(r 2 , t) =
i=1 fi (r 2 , t) . Therefore, the coupling of a FD site to a LB site
is straightforward. The reverse is a bit more involved. In order to update the
LB scheme at r 0 and time t + ∆t, we need f1 (r 0 , t). This quantity is not known
because the site r 1 is only treated with the FD scheme. Indeed, if the LB scheme
had been applied to the full domain, then f1 (r 0 , t) would have been propagated
from lattice site r 1 . However, the value of f1 (r 0 , t) can be computed from our
(0)
(1)
(0)
dictionary f1 (r 0 , t) = f1 (r 0 , t) + f1 (r 0 , t) with f1 (r 0 , t) = ρ(r 0 , t)/4 and
(1)
f1 (r 0 , t) = −(τ ∆t/4) v i · ∇ρ(r 0 , t). In order to obtain ∇ρ(r 0 , t), we use a
second order ﬁnite diﬀerence approximation of ρ over the nearest neighbors
∇ρ(r 0 , t) =

ρ(r 2 , t) − ρ(r 1 , t)
.
2∆r

(6)

Note that in the particular case where only one fi is missing, the connection can
be made in a simpler way. As ρ = i fi is known from the FD calculation, and
f2 , f3 and f4 are known from the LB calculation, one has f1 = ρ−f2 −f3 −f4 . In
the simple case described here, this approach gives a correct coupling. However,
it no longer works if the interface between Ω1 and Ω2 is irregular because the
previous expression is not suﬃcient to determine more than one fi .

Numerical Validation

To validate the coupling algorithm proposed in the previous section, we performed the simulation of a source-sink problem on the geometry deﬁned in ﬁg. 1.
The domain size is Lx = Ly = 30 in lattice units. The boundary conditions are
ρ((0, y), t) = 10 and ρ((Lx , y), t) = 0 on the left and right sides of Ω and the
initial conditions are ρ((0, y), 0) = 10 and ρ((x, y), 0) = 0 for x = 0. On the lower
and upper walls, we apply periodic conditions ρ((x, Ly + 1), t) = ρ((x, 0), t) and
ρ((x, −1), t) = ρ((x, Ly ), t). The vertical interface between the subdomains is
positioned at x = 6, with the FD scheme over the left region and the LB over
the right one. Hence, the geometry is actually 1-dimensional.
This simple set-up with the above boundary and initial conditions allows for
an analytic solution to the diﬀusion equation for the time-dependent dynamics,

After several iterations, the system converges to a steady state in which the
density proﬁle is expected to be a linear function of x satisfying the boundary
conditions. To illustrate the importance of a correct coupling at the subdomain
interface, we plot in ﬁgs. 2a, 2b, 2c (left) the density proﬁle obtained from the
(0)
(1)
numerical solution with the full coupling f1 = f1 + f1 , the one without the
(0)
gradient correction, i.e. with the approximation f1 ≈ f1 , and the theoretical
proﬁle. We also plot in ﬁgs. 2a, 2b, 2c (right) the error with respect to the
analytic solution. From the breaking of the slope observed in ﬁg. 2c (left) we
conclude that the gradient correction is necessary to obtain the correct density
proﬁle and continuity of the particle current.
We computed the relative error in the L2 -norm for the lattice resolution used
in the simulation. For 100 (resp. 500, 5000) time steps, we get a 1.2% (resp. 0.6%,
0.3%) relative error for the full coupling. We expect the level of accuracy of our
mapping to be the same as the LB itself: second order in the lattice spacing.

Conclusion

In this work, a LB scheme is spatially coupled to a FD scheme on a computational domain partitioned in two regions. We propose a way to relate the LB
distribution functions fi with the classical physical quantities and their derivatives. This is a ﬁrst step towards coupling correctly a LB scheme with another
method. Hence, to focus on the methodology only, we consider the simplest possible situation: a diﬀusion process solved by the LB approach on one region and

with a FD solver on the other. At the interface, the LB and FD are connected
so as to preserve continuity of the physical quantities. The connection between
the fi s and the standard macroscopic physical quantities is obtained using a
multiscale Chapman-Enskog expansion to split the fi s in an equilibrium and a
nonequilibrium part. The former is related to the particle density and the latter
to its gradient. Our coupling methodology is indeed an approximation since we
neglect higher-order derivatives in the nonequilibrium distributions. A validation
was performed by running numerical simulations on a 2D domain and comparing
them with an analytic solution. Our mapping has the same level of accuracy as
the LB itself: second order in the lattice spacing.
Regarding future work, it seems natural to try to couple two domains with
diﬀerent meshes. A good enough interpolation is needed to keep the second-order
accuracy of the coupling scheme (see [2]). This as well as the case of an irregular
boundary is under investigation. Other perspectives include applying the same
methodology to the LB reaction-diﬀusion, wave and ﬂuid models. We also wish
to couple diﬀerent LB dynamics: a diﬀusive region with a convective one. With
respect to coupling an incompressible Navier-Stokes solver with a “compressible”
LB ﬂuid model, we believe that the pressure obtained from the Navier-Stokes
solver can be used to specify the density of the LB scheme, and conversely. We
plan to examine this on a Poiseuille ﬂow and on Blasius’ problem.
