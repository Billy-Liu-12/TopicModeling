Abstract. Teletraﬃc in the Internet is rapidly growing and diversifying,
and there is a strong need for QoS support in high-speed communication
networks. There are a number of research issues concerning the transmission of JPEG/ MPEG video over modern high speed computer networks.
These problems have been studied intensively over the last ten years
in order to provide a consistent and desirable QoS for JPEG/MPEG
video traﬃc, construct accurate models for JPEG/MPEG video traﬃc
and utilise eﬃcient resource allocation techniques. In the paper we show
that synthetically generated streams of VBR video, compressed under
such standards as JPEG, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, can be statistically
equivalent to real video traces. We also investigate how compression algorithms on correlation structure of compressed teletraﬃc inﬂuence real
video traﬃc.

Introduction

Teletraﬃc in the Internet is rapidly growing and diversifying, and there is a
strong need for QoS (Quality of Service) support in high-speed communication
networks [1], [6]. The introduction of many new multimedia services requires
a high bandwidth to transport data such as real-time digital video. Modern
computer networks can no longer cope with uncompressed multimedia traﬃc,
resulting in the development of several image and video compression standards
such as JPEG and MPEG. In this paper we focus on VBR (Variable Bit Rate)
JPEG/MPEG video, i.e., on video streams compressed according to JPEG and
MPEG standards and transmitted as VBR components of an ATM network.
There are a number of research issues concerning the transmission of JPEG/
MPEG video over modern high speed computer networks, such as the dimensioning of multiplexer buﬀers and monitoring of video cell streams. These problems
have been studied intensively over the last ten years in order to provide a consistent and desirable QoS for JPEG/MPEG video traﬃc, construct accurate
models for JPEG/MPEG video traﬃc and utilise eﬃcient resource allocation

techniques. We look at the inﬂuence of compression algorithms on correlation
structure of compressed teletraﬃc, see Section 4, where results of compression
of Star Wars video under JPEG and MPEG-1 are discussed.
Applicability of gamma/Pareto model as marginal distributions of compressed
video streams is discussed in Section 4, where we look at accuracy of this approximation in relation to data coming from diﬀerent videos (Star Wars and Titanic)
compressed under three diﬀerent algorithms (JPEG, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2).
We also show that synthetically generated streams of VBR video, compressed
under such standards as JPEG, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, are statistically similar
to real video traces [7].
A number of researchers tried to ﬁt a speciﬁc mathematical model to traces
of real VBR video traﬃc. For example, several models (based on gamma [3], lognormal [10], and combined gamma/Pareto [2], [9]) have been suggested for VBR
video traﬃc. Heyman et al. [3] used a 30-minute compressed videoteleconferencing sequence for simulation studies using the gamma model. Krunz
et al. [10] used a 23-minute movie, The Wizard of Oz, to study statistical characteristics of VBR MPEG-coded video streams using the lognormal model. The
gamma model for video traﬃc became inaccurate in the tail of distribution, and
the lognormal model was too heavy-tailed at ﬁrst and then fell oﬀ too rapidly.
Garrett and Willinger [2] used a two-hour VBR video, Star Wars, and proposed
a hybrid gamma/Pareto model based on the F-ARIMA process [4]. They found
that the tail behaviour of the marginal distribution can be accurately described
using the heavy-tailed Pareto distributions.
Huang et al. [5] presented a uniﬁed approach to modelling VBR video traﬃc
using both SRD (Short-Range Dependent) and LRD (Long-Range Dependent)
empirical ACFs (Auto-correlation Functions). They applied this approach to 2
hours’ trace of Last Action Hero video. Their approach is potentially accurate,
but establishing an automatic search for the best background ACF remains an
open problem. Lombardo et al. [12] proposed the generation of pseudo-MPEG
video traﬃc with a speciﬁc correlation structure based on FFT [14] and an
ICDF transformation, assuming an arbitrary marginal distribution of the output
process. The proposed algorithm has been used to generate a sequence with the
same statistical characteristics as those of the movie “The Simpsons”, however,
the robustness of this algorithm remains an issue open to further investigation.

JPEG/MPEG Video Compression

Several algorithms have been developed to compress video data, in order to reduce the memory required for their storage, the time or bandwidth necessary for
their transmission, and the eﬀective data access or transfer rate. We focus on
MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 of the MPEG standard family. MPEG-2 uses encoders
from the MPEG-1 scheme, and in the case of multi-layer encoding, the statistical
properties of its base layer are almost identical to MPEG-1. A video sequence
is simply a series of pictures taken at closely spaced time intervals starting with
a sequence header. The sequence header is followed by one or more group(s) of

pictures (GOP) and ends with a sequence end code. Additional sequence headers may appear between any GOP within the video sequence. This is achieved
by using three types of frames: Intra-coded picture (I-frame), Predictive-coded
picture (P-frame) and Bi-directionally predictive-coded picture (B-frame) [13].
Only I- and P-frames can be used as a reference for past and/or future prediction. An ordered collection of I-, P- and B-frames is called a group of pictures.
The proportion of I-, P- and B-frames is application-dependent and is left to the
user. For example, for many scenes, spacing the reference frames at about onetwelfth of a second interval seems appropriate, i.e., IBBPBBPBBPBB. . .. The
MPEG GOP pattern was used to encode the MPEG-1 version of Star Wars by
Garrett and Willinger [2].
We encoded three hours of Titanic video to obtain a realistic full-length trace
of video traﬃc. This will be used as a control reference self-similar trace in our
investigations. Parameters of the sequence are summarised in Table 1. We chose
MPEG-2 to obtain encoded frame sequences of our trace. In this paper we will
use the following three self-similar sequences: (i) two hours of Star Wars video
encoded by JPEG [2], (ii) two hours of Star Wars video encoded by MPEG-1 [2],
and (iii) three hours of Titanic video encoded by MPEG-2 [7]. The last trace was
obtained by taking a sample that was approximately 60% longer than Sequence
(i) and (ii).

Modelling for Self-similar VBR Video Traﬃc

Following the recommendation of Garrett and Willinger [2], we chose to use
the combined gamma/Pareto model for VBR video traﬃc. They along with
Krunz and Makowski [9], showed that the gamma distribution can be used to
capture the main part of the empirical distribution, but is inappropriate for the
tail. Addition of a heavy-tailed Pareto distribution corrects this, as shown in
Figure 1.
Let FΓ and FP be the CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function) for the
gamma and Pareto distributions, respectively. Note that FΓ has no closed form

If αΓ is a positive integer, then the CDF for the gamma distribution is given

FP (x) =

for x < 1,

(2)

where αP is the shape parameter, αP > 0, and bP is the minimum allowed value
of x, 0 < bP ≤ x.
Thus, the combined gamma/Pareto distribution is determined by
⎧
for x ≤ 0,
⎨ 0,
(3)
FΓ/P (x) = FΓ (x), for 0 < x ≤ x∗ ,
⎩
FP (x), for x > x∗ .
The complementary CDFs of FΓ (x) and FP (x) can be used to determine x∗
in Equation (3). The parameters of the gamma distribution are obtained by
matching the ﬁrst and second moments of the empirical sequence to those of
a gamma random variate. x∗ can be obtained graphically by inspecting the
tail behaviour of the empirical distribution, and determining where it starts to
deviate from the tail of the gamma curve. The values of bP and αP for the
estimated Pareto distribution can be obtained by ﬁnding x = x∗ for which the
least-square ﬁt of the Pareto tail gives FΓ (x) = FP (x). Figure 1 shows log-log
plots of gamma and Pareto complementary CDF for real VBR video traﬃc.
While the gamma curve ﬁts the main part of the empirical video traﬃc well, the
Pareto curve closely ﬁts its tail part. Applying this method, we have determined
values of x∗ for all three samples; see Table 2.

Given a self-similar sequence of the FGN-DW (Fractional Gaussian NoiseDaubechies Wavelets) process X [8], we can transform the marginal distribution

Note that for computing FΓ−1 (y), we used the Newton-Raphson technique
[11], [15]. The procedure for the MPEG video consists of I-, P- and B-frames of
sequences generated from FGN-DW [8], which are then combined in I-, B- and
P-frame order (e.g., IBBPBBPBBPBBPBBI . . .) before transforming the corresponding time series into time series with the gamma/Pareto marginal distributions deﬁned in Equation (4). The procedure for the JPEG synthetic sequence
generated from FGN-DW is simple. We used the sequences obtained from the
previous procedure for simulation studies of VBR video traﬃc, which we describe
in the next section.

Table 3 shows the estimates of the Hurst parameter for the three video sequences.
Comparing Star Wars after JPEG and MPEG-1, we can formulate hypothesis
that JPEG produces stronger dependent output video sequences. Our results
show 2% diﬀerence in H parameter when using the wavelet-based H estimator,
and 11% diﬀerence when using Whittle’s MLE, see Table 3. On the other hand,
two diﬀerent videos (Star Wars and Titanic) show that regardless of compression
algorithm resulted processes have the same marginal distribution well approximated by our gamma/Pareto model. This can be regarded as generalisation of a
ﬁnding by Garrett and Willinger [2] who showed that gamma/Pareto model is a
good approximation of marginal distributions for Star Wars compressed under
JPEG.

Simulation Results of the VBR Video Traﬃc Model

Figure 2 shows quantile-quantile plots for the distribution of frame sizes in bytes
of real VBR video traﬃc, (i.e., Star Wars JPEG, Star Wars MPEG-1, and
Titanic MPEG-2), and the combined gamma/Pareto model based on FGN-DW.
We observed that although the compression algorithms used for encoding the
various videos were diﬀerent, the combined model ﬁts the real traﬃc statistic
well. Note especially that the distribution of the gamma/Pareto model matches
the real Star Wars JPEG video traﬃc well.
Figure 3 shows that the ACF of the combined gamma/Pareto model also ﬁt
the empirical video traﬃc statistic well. The ACF curve of the gamma/Pareto
model at large lags (i.e., lags > 1,800) ﬁt the real Star Wars JPEG video traﬃc
well, but the model slightly underestimated at small lags. The ACF curves in
Figures 3 (b) and (c) also oscillated more than the one in Figure 3 (a), due to
the MPEG format. Furthermore, the autocorrelation structure in Figure 3 (b)
oscillated more than that in Figure 3 (c) because they use diﬀerent frame formats
(i.e., while every 12th frame in Figure 3 (b) is an I-frame, every 15th frame in
Figure 3 (c) is an I-frame). In addition, we found strong evidence of LRD, as all
ACF curves obtained from the real video traﬃc and the gamma/Pareto model

Conclusions

We showed how pseudo-random self-similar sequences can be applied to produce
a model of teletraﬃc associated with the transmission of VBR JPEG/MPEG
video. A combined gamma/Pareto model based on the application of the FGNDW generator was used to synthesise VBR JPEG/MPEG video traﬃc.
In the paper we showed that synthetically generated streams of VBR video,
compressed under such standards as JPEG, MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, can be statistically equivalent to real video traces shown in Section 4 (see also Figures
2 – 3). We investigated how compression algorithms on correlation structure
of compressed teletraﬃc inﬂuence real video traﬃc. Generalisation of ﬁndings
of Garrett and Willinger, showing that video compression algorithms (MPEG-1
and MPEG-2) lead to self-similar processes was studied. We considered outcomes
of MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 in addition to previously studied outcomes of JPEG
[2], to show that the results of (Garrett and Willinger [2]) do not depend on the
compression algorithms.

Better GOP and cell-layered modelling is needed for development of integrated MPEG video traﬃc models. While some general assessment of queueing
performance can be obtained from single-streams, more universal results could
be obtained from the queueing performance analysis of multiplexed streams of
video traﬃc. These issues await further investigations.
