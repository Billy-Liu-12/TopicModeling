Abstract
In this short note, a direct proof of L2 convergence of an Euler–Maruyama approximation of a Zakai equation
driven by a square integrable martingale is shown. The order
√ of convergence is as known for real-valued stochastic
diﬀerential equations and for less general driving noises O( Δt) for a time discretization step size Δt.

1. Introduction
A large amount of literature on the numerical study of real-valued stochastic diﬀerential equations (SDEs) exists
(cf. [1], [2]), while Hilbert space valued stochastic diﬀerential equations (or SPDEs) have just been treated in recent
years. SDEs appear in various models in ﬁnancial mathematics. However, in the last years an increasing number
of problems have surfaced for which inﬁnite dimensional noise seems to be more appropriate, and which are then
modeled by SPDEs such as interest rate modeling ([3], [4]) and energy markets ([5]). To calculate prices one needs a
numerical approximation of inﬁnite dimensional Hilbert space valued stochastic diﬀerential equations.
For a numerical treatment of SPDEs, which will be seen in the more general framework of Hilbert space valued
SDEs, approximation has to be done in space and time. There are various approaches possible. In this paper we study
a semidiscrete Euler–Maruyama scheme which approximates the solution of a stochastic partial diﬀerential equation
of the form
u0 = v,
(1.1)
dut = (A + B)ut dt + G(ut ) dMt ,
in time. The generalization of this approach to fully discrete schemes is currently under investigation. Here M is a —
not necessarily continuous — square integrable martingale with values in a separable Hilbert space U. Probably the
most popular examples of such stochastic processes are Wiener and L´evy processes. The operators A and B act on
a separable Hilbert space H, where A is generator of a C0 semigroup of contractions which is a necessary condition
below, and the operator G is a mapping from H into the linear operators from U to H.

In the literature Euler–Maruyama schemes are approximations of the stochastic integral of an SDE which are
derived from the Itˆo–Taylor expansion [1]. For the simplest example of a real-valued SDE
dXt = Xt dBt ,

X0 = x

with Brownian motion B, it is given by
X j+1 = (1 + ΔB j )X j
√
and converges of order O( Δt) where Δt denotes the time discretization step size. The elements ΔB j are the normal
distributed increments of the Brownian motion. For an SPDE as introduced here but driven by a Q–Wiener process
2
a similar time discretization
√ was derived in [6] and [7]. The scheme introduced in these papers converges in L and
almost surely of order O( Δt) and has the iterative form
X j+1 = S Δt X j + S Δt BX j Δt + S Δt G(X j ) (W(t j+1 ) − W(t j )),
where S denotes the semigroup generated by A. There, higher order schemes are also developed. In this paper we
will use a similar scheme but the driving noise is a square integrable martingale. Furthermore, in [7] and [8] the
authors proved almost sure convergence by Chebyshev’s inequality and the Borel–Cantelli lemma, giving estimates
in L p for p > 2. These estimates implied L2 convergence immediately but the methods did not work for L2 estimates.
Here, we present an approach to prove L2 convergence directly for a much simpler scheme. It is subject of future
work to generalize this idea to fully discrete approximations and higher order schemes. The reason why we look at L2
convergence instead of L p for p > 2 is that for non-continuous martingales Burkholder–Davis–Gundy type inequalities
that preserve the known orders of convergence for continuous martingales do not exist and therefore worse orders of
L2 convergence will be achieved. This can be seen by looking at the moments of a Poisson process for p ≥ 2. For
small times t they all behave like t independently of the moment. So far, to the knowledge of the author, there do not
exist results for almost sure convergence for Zakai’s equation with that type of noise.
The type of equation studied in this paper appears naturally in the study of ﬁltering problems with Zakai’s equation
(cf. [9]). Fully discrete approximations of its solution were already studied in [6], while a semidiscrete time approximation with higher order of convergence was presented in [7] and a Galerkin–Milstein approximation was done in [8].
Zakai’s classical nonlinear ﬁltering problem transformed to an SPDE and extended to square integrable martingales
is given by
(1.2)
dut (x) = L∗ ut (x) dt + G(ut (x)) dMt (x)
on a bounded domain D ⊂ Rd with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions on ∂D and initial condition u0 (x) = v(x). The
operator L∗ is a second order elliptic diﬀerential operator of the form
L∗ u =

d
1 d
∑ ∂ i ∂ j a i j u − ∑ ∂i f i u
2 i, j=1
i=1

for u ∈ Cc2 (D) and it can be split into the operators A and B in Equation (1.1). This will be done explicitly in Section 2.
Originally the operator G denotes a pointwise multiplication with a suitable function g ∈ H. This is included in the
more general assumptions on G in Equation (1.1) which will be introduced in detail in the next section.
The work is organized as follows: Section 2 sets up the framework including the properties and the regularity of
the SPDEs to be approximated. In Section
√ 3 the time discretization scheme is introduced and the main result that the
approximation converges of order O( Δt) in L2 is shown. Finally, the last section presents future work that should
be done using the presented estimation methods.

comments and to anonymous referees for helpful comments.
2. Framework
Let H denote the Hilbert space L2 (D), where D ⊂ Rd is a bounded domain with piecewise smooth boundary ∂D.
We are interested in developing a numerical algorithm to approximate the solution of equation
dut = (A + B)ut dt + G(ut ) dMt

on the ﬁnite time interval [0, T ] with initial condition u0 = v and zero Dirichlet boundary conditions on ∂D. M is
a square integrable martingale — not necessarily continuous — on a ﬁltered probability space (Ω, F, (Ft ), P) with
values in a separable Hilbert space (U, (⋅, ⋅)U ). The space of all square integrable martingales on U with respect to
(Ft ) is denoted by M2 (U). We restrict ourselves to the following class of square integrable martingales
C ∶= {M ∈ M2 (U) ∶ ∃ Q ∈ L1+ such that ∀t ≥ s ≥ 0, ⟪M, M⟫t − ⟪M, M⟫ s ≤ (t − s)Q},
where L1+ denotes the space of all nuclear, symmetric, positive-deﬁnite operators. The operator angle bracket process
⟪M, M⟫t is deﬁned as
t

⟪M, M⟫t = ∫ Q s d⟨M, M⟩ s ,
0

where ⟨M, M⟩t denotes the unique angle bracket process from the Doob–Meyer decomposition. The process (Q s , s ≥
0) is called the martingale covariance.
Since Q ∈ L1+ (U), there exists an orthonormal basis (en , n ∈ N) of U consisting of eigenvectors of Q. Therefore
we have the representation Qen = γn en , where γn ≥ 0 is the eigenvalue corresponding to en . The square root of Q is
deﬁned as
x∈U
Q1/2 x ∶= ∑(x, en )U γn1/2 en ,
n

and Q−1/2 is the pseudo inverse of Q1/2 . Let us denote by (H, (⋅, ⋅)H ) the Hilbert space deﬁned by H = Q1/2 (U)
endowed with the inner product (x, y)H = (Q−1/2 x, Q−1/2 y)U for x, y ∈ H.
In what follows we introduce a generalization of the Itˆo “isometry” for square integrable martingales of class C,
where LHS (H, H) refers to the space of all Hilbert–Schmidt operators from H to H and ∥⋅∥LHS (H,H) denotes the corresponding norm. Let the space of integrands be given by L2H,T (H) ∶= L2 (Ω×[0, T ], P[0,T ] , P⊗dλ; LHS (H, H)), where
P[0,T ] denotes the σ–ﬁeld of predictable sets in Ω × [0, T ] and dλ is the Lebesgue measure, then by Equation (1.6)
in [10], we have, as a generalization of Proposition 8.16 in [11], for every X ∈ L2H,T (H) an Itˆo type inequality

(2.2)

For a full introduction to Hilbert space valued stochastic diﬀerential equations we refer the reader to [11, 12, 13].
The operators A and B in Equation (2.1) are derived from L∗ in Equation (1.2). We assume that the functions ai j ,
¯ The operator
for i, j = 1, . . . , d, are twice continuously diﬀerentiable on D with continuous extension to the closure D.
A is the unique self-adjoint extension of the diﬀerential operator
d

∑ ∂i (ai j ∂ j u),

i, j=1

u ∈ Cc2 (D),

where ∂i denotes the derivative in the ith coordinate direction of Rd and Cc2 (D) is the space of all twice continuously
diﬀerentiable functions on D with compact support, to the second order Sobolev space H02 with elements satisfying
zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. B is a ﬁrst order diﬀerential operator given by
d

Bu ∶= ∑ ∂i (bi u),
i=1

u ∈ Cc1 (D),

¯ with elements bi that are deﬁned as
for f continuously diﬀerentiable on D with continuous extension to D,
bi ∶=

1 d
∑ ∂ j ai j − fi .
2 j=1

With the following assumptions the right hand side of Equation (2.1) is well deﬁned.
Assumptions 2.1. The coeﬃcients of A and B and the initial condition u0 satisfy the following conditions:

1618

(a) ai j and fi , i, j = 1, . . . , d belong to the space of all twice continuously diﬀerentiable functions with bounded
¯
derivatives on D denoted by Cb2 (D) with continuous extension to D,
(b) ∑di, j=1 ai j (x)ξi ξ j ≥ δ∥ξ∥2Rd for all x ∈ D and ξ ∈ Rd ,
(c) u0 is F0 -measurable and E(∥u0 ∥2H 1 ) < +∞.
Assumption 2.1(b) implies that the operator A is dissipative, see e.g. [14]. Then by the Lumer–Phillips theorem,
e.g. [15], A generates a strongly continuous contraction semigroup on H which we denote by S = (S t , t ≥ 0). By
Corollary 2 in [16], S is analytic in the right half-plane. Therefore fractional powers of A are well deﬁned, cf. [15],
and we denote for simplicity reasons A−α = (−A)−α and Aα = A−1
−α for α > 0. With this notion we make the following
assumptions:
Assumptions 2.1 (cont’d). The operator G satisﬁes for a constant C ∈ R+ the following conditions:
(d) ∥G(φ)∥LHS (H,H) ≤ C(1 + ∥φ∥H ) for φ ∈ H,
(e) ∥G(φ) − G(ψ)∥LHS (H,H) ≤ C∥φ − ψ∥H for φ, ψ ∈ H,
(f) ∥A1/2G(φ)∥LHS (H,H) ≤ C (1 + ∥φ∥H 1 ) for φ ∈ H 1 .
We shall make use of the following lemma — whose statement is also known as Kato’s conjecture — and which
was proved in [17].
Lemma 2.2. The domain of A1/2 satisﬁes that D(A1/2 ) = H01 , where H0m denotes the Sobolev space of order m with
zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, and the norm ∥A1/2 ⋅ ∥H is equivalent to ∥ ⋅ ∥H 1 , i.e. there exists C > 0 such that
∥A1/2 φ∥H ≤ C ∥φ∥H 1 and ∥φ∥H 1 ≤ C ∥A1/2 φ∥H
for all φ ∈ H 1 .
Deﬁnition 2.3. Let u0 be a F0 -measurable square integrable random variable with values in H. A predictable process
u ∶ R+ × Ω → H is called a mild solution to (2.1), if
sup E(∥ut ∥2H ) < +∞

t∈[0,T ]

for all T ∈ (0, +∞), and if for all t > 0
t

t

ut = S t u0 + ∫ S t−s Bu s ds + ∫ S t−sG(u s ) dM s .

(2.3)

It follows from Assumptions 2.1 that these integrals are well deﬁned and Equation (2.1) has a unique mild solution
by results in Chapter 9 of [11]. Furthermore we have similarly to [18], [19], [20], [10] that Equation (2.2) implies for
all X ∈ L2H,T (H)
t

E( sup ∥ ∫ S t−s X s dM s ∥2H ) ≤ C E( ∫

∥X s ∥2LHS (H,H) ds).

(2.4)

To simplify the notation we introduce the following norm for a mapping Φ from [0, T ] × Ω into H with ﬁnite p-th
moment for ﬁxed p ≥ 1
1/p

∥Φ∥ p,H,T ∶= (E( sup ∥Φ(t)∥Hp ))
0≤t≤T

.

The next Lemma provides some insight on the regularity of the mild solution.
Lemma 2.4. Under Assumptions 2.1 the mild solution satisﬁes ∥u∥2,H 1 ,T < +∞.

where we used the property of the contraction semigroup and Equation (2.4) in the second step, Lemma 2.2, Corollary
1.4 in [21] and the deﬁnition of the Bochner integral in the third one, and H¨older’s and Gronwall’s inequality in the
fourth. The last steps are shown in more detail in the proof of the main result.
The regularity of the solution is given in the following lemma, where we set, for an H-valued stochastic process

Proof. Let

t

φ(t) = ∫ S t−s Bu s ds

and

t

ψ(t) = ∫ S t−sG(u s ) dM s ,

then we estimate employing Assumptions 2.1, Theorem 2.6.13 in [21], Equation (2.4), and Lemma 2.2
∥u − ur ∥22,H,r,R ≤ 4(∥(S − S (r))u0 ∥22,H,r,R + ∥(S (⋅ − r) − 1l)(φ(r) + ψ(r))∥22,H,r,R

≤ C(1 + ∥u∥22,H 1 ,T ) (R − r).

3. Discretization and main result
In this section we give a time discretization of Euler–Maruyama type that approximates Equation (2.1). This
semidiscrete scheme gives the main idea how to approach L2 convergence if L p convergence for p > 2 is not available
or not optimal due to the properties of the not necessarily continuous square integrable martingale as driving noise.
Generalizations to higher order schemes as in [7] and fully discrete schemes as in [8] will be possible with this
approach and are subject to future work.

We shall always consider a ﬁnite time horizon: t ∈ [0, T ] with T < +∞. Let T = (Tm , m ∈ N) be a sequence
of partitions Tm , m ∈ N, of the interval [0, T ] whose mesh Δm tends to zero as m tends to +∞. We write Tm as
{t0m , t1m , . . . , tnmm } with nm ∈ N, 0 = t0m < t1m < ⋯ < tnmm = T , and

This Euler–Maruyama type scheme converges in L2 of order O( Δm ) as for similar schemes for SDEs (cf. [1])
and for less general driving noises (cf. [6], [7], [8]):

Theorem 3.1. Under Assumptions 2.1, there exists a constant C ∈ R+ depending on the properties of the solution of
the SPDE (2.1) and T , such that for all m ∈ N
∥u − um ∥22,H,T ≤ C Δm .

Next we give estimates on the six diﬀerent expressions separately. We start with ξ1m and apply ﬁrst the properties of
the Bochner integral:

where C denotes a constant varying from line to line and independent of m. Finally, we take the supremum of ∥Bu s ∥H

(T − s)−1/2 ds)2 ∥Bu∥22,H,T ) ≤ C 4T ∥u∥22,H 1 ,T Δm .

For the second term we use again Theorem 2.6.13 in [21] and split the singularity in zero. H¨older’s inequality is
applied and leads to

The regularity of the solution from Lemma 2.5 leads to

∥u − um ∥22,H,T ≤ 6 ∑(∥ξim ∥22,H,T + ∥ηm

i=1

T

(1 + (T − s)−1/2 )∥u − um ∥22,H,s ds

and Gronwall’s inequality yields
∥u − um ∥22,H,T ≤ C1 (1 + ∥u∥22,H 1 ,T ) Δm exp(C2 ∫

0

T

(1 + (T − s)−1/2 ) ds) ≤ CΔm

due to the properties of the solution from Lemma 2.4. This proves the theorem.
4. Future work
In this short note, the problems that arise when looking at the approximation of SPDEs driven by non-continuous
square integrable martingales are presented. As the absence of similar Burkholder–Davis–Gundy type inequalities for
non-continuous driving noises as for continuous ones causes problems especially in connection with time approximations, we show here a way how to prove mean square convergence directly for a simple time discretization scheme.
Previously, this was done by proving L p convergence for p > 2 and applying H¨older’s inequality. This approach leads
without Burkholder–Davis–Gundy type inequalities that have the same convergence properties as for continuous martingales to worse upper bounds for the order of convergence than with direct estimates. The approach presented here
has to be generalized to fully discrete schemes and higher order approximations like Milstein schemes in future work,
which shall be straight forward similarly to [7] and [8].
