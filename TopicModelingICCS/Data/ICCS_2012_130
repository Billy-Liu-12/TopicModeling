Abstract
A framework for visualizing and detecting climate variability and change based on time-dependent probability
density functions (PDFs) is developed. A set of information-theoretic statistics based on the Shannon Entropy and
the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) are deﬁned to assess PDF complexity and temporal variability. The KLDbased measures quantify the representativeness of a thirty year sampling window of a larger climatic record, how well
a long sample can predict a smaller sample’s PDF, and how well one thirty year sample matches a similar sample
shifted in time. These techniques are applied the the Central England Temperature record, the longest continuous
meteorological observational record.
Keywords: Probability Density Function, Information Theory, Climate Variability, Climate Change

1. Introduction
Climate is a statistical construct computed from meteorological state data sampled over a predeﬁned period. By
convention, this window sampling period W is thirty years—a number arrived at literally by a vote at a 1937 International Meteorological Organization meeting [1, 2]. Climate models do not model the climate directly, they compute
solutions to equations of evolution for the earth system’s instantaneous state, write this data to history ﬁles, which are
then subsequently post-processed to compute climatologies. The I/O-intensive nature of coupled climate models is
arguably the most signiﬁcant barrier to surmount in creating an exascale climate model. This raises a natural question:
Can we model the climate directly? This is a large fundamental question whose answer is obviously beyond the scope
of this paper. A ﬁrst step in this direction, however, is whether one could model univariate climate dyanmics, for
example, the probability density function (PDF) of some quantity X and the variation of this PDF ρ(X, t) with respect
to X and time t. A likely candidate model would be some form of the Fokker-Planck equation
∂t ρ(X, t) + ∂X [D1 (X, t)ρ(X, t)] = ∂X [D2 (X, t)∂X ρ(X, t)].

(1)

In (1), D1 (X, t) is the drift term and D2 (X, t) is the diﬀusion term. Direct deterministic modeling of a time-dependent
climate PDF using something like (1) is a potent idea because the PDF provides a comprehensive description of a
sample’s underlying population statistics. Direct dynamic modeling of ρ(X, t) would enable deterministic modeling
of moments and estimates for quantiles and extrema. Alas, this paper will not deliver such a direct model. As a ﬁrst
step toward the search for climate PDF equations of evolution, however, I examine the problem of PDF estimation

from climate data samples, and present a set of information-theoretic quantities to characterize climate PDFs, measure
climate variability, and to identify periods of relative climatic stability and rapid climatic change.
For a given meteorological variable X, I propose a methodology for answering the following questions regarding
a windowed sample of W years taken from a longer record of Y years:
Q1 What does the W-window-sampled ρ(t, X) look like, how conﬁdent can we be of its structure, and how does it
evolve in time?
Q2 What is the information content of a sample of W years? How does it evolve in time over the record of Y years,
and what does this signify?
Q3 How well does a sample of W years predict the whole available data record of Y > W years, or other major,
climatically relevant subsets of the whole record?
Q4 How well does knowledge of the whole record’s time-independent PDF ρ(X) predict a local W-window-samplegenerated PDF ρ(t, X)? That is, when viewed with prior knowledge of the parent density function, how unusual
does ρ(t, X) look?
Q5 How well does one W-window sample’s PDF q(t, X) predict another W-window sample’s PDF p(t , X)?
Q6 Is it possible to use time-dependent PDFs to classify periods of time that are climatically stable, or undergoing
climatic change?
I will address Q1 using a density estimation technique employs a Bayesian-derived optimal binning scheme. This
binning scheme provides estimated probability density functions in a form that is highly compatible with computing
key information-theoretic statistics. These information-theoretic statistics will provide the means to address Q2-Q6.
Application of these techniques to a classic meteorological timeseries—the Central England Temperature Record
(CET; [3])—will provide striking visualizations of the evolution of the climate over this record, reveal previously
known properties, and put in stark contrast the current climate’s oddity with respect to the previous observational
record.
2. Probability Density and Distribution Functions, Information Theory, and Climate
For a random continuous variable X ∈ (−∞, ∞) the probability density function p(X) satisﬁes the following
∞
conditions: p(x) > 0, ∀x ∈ (−∞, ∞), and −∞ p(x)dx = 1. The cumulative distribution function (CDF) P(x) is the
x
fraction of the sample for which x < x; that is, P(x) = −∞ p(x )dx
Suppose x depends on another variable–say the time t–so that x → x(t). If the time evolution of x. Then,
the creating the PDF for x should recognize the temporal sensitivity of x, and it may vary in time; that is p(x) →
p(x, t). If the underlying statistics of X remain stationary, then the probability density will remain solely a function
of x. Nonstationarity—temporal sensitivity of the PDF—raises the question of how to estimate p(x, t). A common
technique—and one used by the climate community—is to sample x(t) using a time window of width W and centered
at a time tC , resulting in a sample S = x(t), t ∈ [tC − W2 , tC + W2 ], and estimating a univariate p(x)|t=tC to get p(x, tC ).
Advancing this window through time then provides p(x, t). This windowed sampling technique underlies estimation of
the PDFs presented here, and is also used to estimate CDFs. Together, the windowed sampling and binning technique
described in Section 3, combined with visualization answer Q1.
Information Theory [4, 5] is a mathematical framework for quantify information content and identify relationships
between random variables. It has been used extensively in the telecommunications and signal processing communities,
but also has seen application in the climate community to problems of predictibility [6], model-reality comparison [7,
8], and to evaluate climate sampling window sizes [9]. Its conceptual roots lie in Boltzmann’s statistical mechanical
formulation of thermodynamic entropy. The Shannon entropy (SE) H(X) is
H(X) = −

∞
−∞

p(x) log p(x)dx.

(2)

The logarithm base in (2)—and in (3) below—deﬁnes the units for information; for bases 2 and e, H(X) is measured
in bits and nats, respectively. H(X) broadly quantiﬁes amount of “surprise” in the distribution of values of X. Given
a precomputed PDF, computing the SE provides an answer to information content component of Q2. Note that
the integral formulation of the SE (2) can yield negative or inﬁnite values; the reason is that the probability density
function p(x) may locally exceed unity. Consider two distinct PDFs for X, p(x) and q(x). The additional information—
or gain—required to predict p(x) given q(x) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD)
DKL (p q) =

(3)

For a time-dependent variable x(t), similar arguments to those presented for PDFs can be applied to compute timewindow-sampled SE and KLD values from (2) and (3), respectively.
The KLD quantiﬁes diﬀerences between PDFs. Sometimes it’s called a “distance measure” or “metric” for PDFs,
but this is inaccurate: The KLD is not symmetric, DKL (p q)/ = DKL (q p). Furthermore, the KLD does not satisfy
the triangle inequality. The nonsymmetric nature of the KLD is of particular use. The representativeness of a particular
W- window’s PDF of a larger record can be addressed by constructing q(x, t) for each W-window of a climate record,
using the entire Y-year record to construct a density p(x), and computing DKL (p q). In fact, DKL (p q) provides an
answer to Q3. Reversing the arguments, an answer to Q4 is DKL (q p). Q5 may be answered by constructing p(x, t)
from two diﬀerent W-windows and computing the KLD. That is, construct two samples S1 = x(t), t ∈ [t1 − W2 , t1 + W2 ]
and S2 = x(t), t ∈ [t2 − W2 , t2 + W2 ], and compute from them p(x, t1 ) and p(x, t2 ), respectively. The time-shifted KLD
DKL (p(x, t1 ) p(x, t2 )) quantiﬁes how much additional information is required to predict the PDF at t = t2 from the
PDF at t = t1 . Large-scale application of the time-shifted KLD to all possible W-sampling windows in a record of Y
years can provide clues periods of relative climatic stability and rapid climate change, providing answers to Q6.
Both the SE and KLD were originally formulated for discrete variables; one replaces the PDFs {p(x), q(x)} with
the probability mass functions (PMF) {π, ζ ∈ N }, respectively, and integrals w.r.t. x in in (2) and (3) with summations
over N discrete states [5]. All PDFs plotted and computed SE and KLD quantities presented in this paper derived from
PMFs estimated from sample data. Numerical computation of the SE is sensitive to the discretisation dx → Δx. Thus,
one must take care in discretising or binning continuous data to form a PMF or PDF, respectively.
3. Computational Methodology
Computation of time-evolving CDFs from the sample is accomplished by constructing an empirical distribution
function from each 30-year subsample of the complete record and sliding this sampling window through the record
one year at a time. Empirical CDF is estimated by sorting each sample, fusing the resultant index permutation to
arrange the subsample from lowest to highest values, and scanning through the values in increasing order to identify
the location of each percentile. This method was used to produce the CDF plots shown in Figures 1(b) and 2.
It is tempting to compute a PDF p(x) by numerically diﬀerentiating the empirical CDF P(x), but this is an illposed problem. More speciﬁcally, small ﬂuctuations in the value of P(x)—or the locations at which these values are
known—can engender large local changes in p(x) = dP
dx An excellent overview of the problem of density estimation
from observational data is given in [10]. I used an optimal binning scheme derived from Bayesian principles [11]. The
technique’s underlying assumptions are: a discrete uniform prior distribution for the number of bins within a feasible
range, a Dirichlet prior distribution for the bin probabilities, and a piecewise constant PDF with uniform bins. Other
prior knowledge I comprises the data sample’s size N, range V and implied bin boundary locations assuming uniform
widths. The posterior probability P(M|d, I) that a PDF with M bins describes the data sample d is [11]
P(M|d, I) ∝

where Γ(·) is the Gamma function and nk is the number of counts in each bin. The value of M that maximizes P(M|d, I)
yields the most probable piecewise constant, uniform-bin-width PDF for d. Maximizing the logarithm of the RHS of

where μi and σ2i are the bin probability densities and associated variances, respectively [11]. Even when data is absent
from a bin, μi 0, and the μi are normalised by construction. The density and its associated uncertainties are deﬁned
by 5 and 6, respectively, thus answering Q1. Densities computed in this manner are used to evaluate all SE- and
KLD-based statistics presented in this paper.
Another desirable characteristic of this PDF estimation scheme is that it is capable of detecting severely truncated
data [12]. Truncated data will clump at its truncated values, adding ﬁne structure to a PDF’s broad shape, spawning a
series of local maxima in the RHS of of (4), growing with M (cf. ﬁgure 5D in [11]). This presents a problem when
applied to the CET data. The CET data are truncated to the nearest 0.1◦ C, and early application of this technique
encountered the problem of successive maxima in the RHS of (4). Truncation eﬀects can be removed by adding
a random uniform deviate that brackets the rounded value by half the truncation value; this will not replace lost
information [12] but does allow estimation of the PDF’s large-scale structure. I have smoothed the CET data by
adding to each observation a uniform random deviate δi ∈ [−0.05, 0.05); this smoothing allows PDF estimation using
(4) and, when truncated to the nearest 0.1◦ C, yields the original timeseries. Multiple random smoothings of the CET
have been performed, and SE and KLD results computed from the diﬀerent smoothings agree [9].
4. The Central England Temperature Record
The CET is longest observational record for surface air temperature. Manley’s original CET [3] comprises monthly
averages beginning in 1659. The daily CET [13] (ﬁgure 1(a)) spans the period 1772–present for average temperatures
(T avg ) and 1878–present for minimum (T min ) and maximum (T max ) temperatures. Sampling periods were 1659–2009
for monthly T avg , 1772–2006 for daily T avg , and 1878–2006 for (T min ,T max ). All data were obtained from the British
Atmospheric Data Centre [14]. CET daily and monthly temperature values are rounded to the nearest 0.1◦ C, with the
exception of the monthly record, which has periods of low (0.5◦ C–1.0◦ C) precision for the periods 1659–99 and 1707–
22. The CET is a well-studied data set. It has a secular warming trend (Figure 1(b)) [15] and exhibits oscillations
beyond the century scale [16]. Figure 1(c) shows the PDF for the full daily CET T avg , obtained using the technique
outlined in Section 3, error bin heights and error bars computed from (5) and (6), respectively.

trend in most quantiles for the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, small variations about a slow upward
trend through balance of the eighteenth through mid-nineteenth centuries, and an upward trend that becomes even
more pronounced after 1950. Daily CET T avg CDF quantiles (Figure 2(a)) show weaker variability than their monthly
averaged counterparts, superimposed on a slow upward trend running throughout the nineteenth through mid-twentieth
centuries, with a dramatic warming trend in most quantiles after 1980. CET daily T min (Figure 2(b)) and T max (Figure
2(c)) CDFs show a similar behavior, but with more pronounced oscillatory components superimposed on their low
and high percentiles.
The time-dependent PDF ρ(t, T avg ) for CET Monthly averages (Figure 3(a)) was computed using (5). The PDF is
bimodal, with the lower (upper) mode steady during the seventeenth century at about 5◦ C (15◦ C). The upper mode is
broadened and ﬂattened around the year 1800 and reappears shortly afterward, trending gently upward through the late
twentieth century. The lower mode is boadened and ﬂattened around the year 1820, reappearing shortly afterward, and
this mode shifts toward warmer temperatures during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries more dramatically than
the upper mode, and the shift steepens after 1950. The early years of the sample 1659–1722 show a more detailed
multimodal structure. This is because the optimal binning scheme chose more bins for 30-year windows during this
period, a consequence of the algorithm’s aforementioned ability to detect truncated data
Uncertainties in ρ(t, T avg ) (Figure 3(b)) were computed from (6) and show higher values throughout the temperature spectrum for the period 1659–1720, casting doubt on their associated PDF values in Figure 3(a). The ratio of the
values in Figure 3(a) to those in Figure 3(b) deﬁne a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio (Figure 3(c)) that quantify conﬁdence
in ρ(t, T avg ). Note that little conﬁdence (S/N < 10) is associated with any values of ρ(t, T avg ) for t ∈ [1659, 1722],
excepting the higher-precision period 1699–1706. The values of ρ(t, T avg ) in the vicinity of its modes after the year
1722 are signiﬁcant (S/N > 10).
Figure 4 summarizes PDF estimation for the daily CET. The PDF ρ(t, T avg ) (Figure 4(a)) is bimodal, with upper
(lower) mode centered near 7◦ C (14◦ C). The lower mode less pronounced for t < 1830. The known warming period
1910–1950 is present with a narrowing and upward shift of the lower mode, which stabilizes for the period 1950–
1975 before again shifting upward and broadening. The S/N ratios for ρ(t, T avg ) (Figure 4(d)) show signiﬁcant values
broadly in the band −1◦ C < T avg < 21◦ C, with the central area around the modes highly signiﬁcant (S/N> 20).
Within this region, PDF isopleths shift upward dramatically after t = 1980. The PDF ρ(t, T min ) (Figure 4(b)) shows
a single mode. This mode is broad for t < 1930, with width ΔT min ≈ 7◦ C and center T min ≈ 5.5◦ C. Around 1930,
the mode narrows dramatically to ΔT min ≈ 4◦ C, with a slight tilt toward warming up until t = 1950.The mode
stabilizes and broadens near t = 1960, with width ΔT min ≈ 7.5◦ C and center that shifts upward to T min ≈ 6.0◦ C.
During the period 1960–1980, the mode broadens further to ΔT min ≈ 8.5◦ C and its center remains stationary. After
1980, the mode narrows, with its lower boundary PDF isopleth moving upwards much more dramatically—a shift
of nearly 2.0◦ C—than its upper counterpart. The mode’s center shifts upward to 8◦ C. S/N values in Figure 4(e) for
ρ(t, T min ) show signiﬁcance for T min ∈ [−5, 15], high signiﬁcance for T min ∈ [−2, 13], with highest signiﬁcance values

clustered about T min ∈ [0, 11], covering the density’s shifting mode. Within this high S/N zone, PDF isopleths in
Figure 4(b) show weak variation superimposed on a slow warming trend of approximatly 1.0◦ C for the period 1878–
2006. The CET T max PDF ρ(t, T max ) (Figure 4(c)) is bimodal, though neither mode is present for the full record.
The upper mode has width and center (ΔT U max ≈ 3◦ C,T U max ≈ 17.5◦ C), and is most during the period 1910–1980.
Its weakness before 1910 appears to be due to broading of the midrange of T max . The disappearence of this mode
after 1980 is caused by midrange broading and fattening of the high-T max tail. The lower mode has width and center
(ΔT L max ≈ 4◦ C,T L max ≈ 10.5◦ C). It is most pronounced during the periods 1893–1937 and 1973–2006. It almost
disappears brieﬂy around 1955, just when the upper mode is at its strongest. Taken together, these modes suggest an
oscillation in ρ(t, T max ) with period of τ ≈ 80 or τ ≈ 70 years if estimated from the peaks in the lower mode or width
of the upper mode, respectively. All of the aforementioned results are signiﬁcant 1◦ C < T max < 24◦ C, and highly
signiﬁcant for 4◦ C < T max < 21◦ C (Figure 4(f)).
SE timeseries H(t) were computed from the ρ(t, T ), using (2). Uncertainty quantiﬁcation was performed by
computating of H using Monte Carlo-generated ensembles of 10000 “neighboring” density functions deﬁned by (5)
and (6) (5). The box-whisker symbols are deﬁned with whiskers corresponding to 1st and 99th percentiles, box
edges the 25th and 75th percentiles, and box center the median. The dramatic up/down jumps in H with respect to
time are thus unlikely to be numerical artifacts. The timeseries of H(T avg ) (Figure 5(a)) shows a pronounced peak
at its maximum value shortly before t = 1820, a time at which the lower mode was weak-to-nonexistent, and this
broadening of would lower dramatically local values of the density and thus create larger logarithmic terms in (2).
The periods with low (high) values of H(T avg ) frequently correspond to times when both the upper and lower modes
in ρ(t, T avg ) are present (absent or weak), but this correspondence is not complete. The SE H(T max ) (Figure 5(c)) are
equally hard to interpret. Each jump and dip in H(T max ) is a sensitive indicator of structural change in ρ(t, T max ), but
identifying the responsible feature(s) is diﬃcult. The simplest of the SE plots to interpret is that of H(T min ) (Figure
5(c)) because ρ(t, T min ) is practically unimodal. The broad high value during 1895–1905 appears to be due to splitting
of the mode. Narrow local maxima H(T min ) are present at other times that the mode is split, namely shortly before
1920 and 1930 and in ﬁrst half of the 1980’s. A wide almost uninterrupted trough in H(T min ) in during the period
1930–1950 appears to be caused by the sharpening of the mode. By contrast, an even lower trough during the period
1965–1982 coexists with the mode being at its widest. Although the SE is clearly a very sensitive integrated measure,
its integrative nature obscures which features are changing its value. Thus, Q2 is answered, but the answer’s utility is
unclear.
Figures 6 (a,c,e) collectively answer the Q3 for the CET monthly T avg and daily (T avg ,T min , T max ). Figure 6(a)
shows the KL gain required, given any thirty-year sample window’s PDF, to predict PDFs derived from the full sample

(1659–2009; solid line) and the preindustrial era (1659–1869; dotted line). From previous discussion, the high KLD
values for 1659–1750 are suspect due to truncation eﬀects during the period 1659–1722. KLD values for the period
1750–1890 are relatively low, with some oscillatory behavior. After 1890 there are dramatic jumps in the KLD to
whole record PDF and even more dramatic increases in the KLD to the preindustrial PDF. There is some drop during
the stabilization period 1950–1975, followed by even more dramatic increases after 1975. Late in the 20th century
the KL gain to the preindustrial PDF is higher than for any other part of the CET record, signifying strong structural
change in the PDF since the preindustrial era. The KL gain for late 20th century densities ρ(t, T avg ) are also high.
Overall, the KL gain identiﬁes much of the twentieth century’s time-evolving climate PDFs as distinctly weaker in
their ability to predict the long-scale record, and thus structurally fundamentally diﬀerent. The daily CET (6(c)) shows
a similar degradation in skill through increasing KLD values during the twentieth centuryThe representativeness of the
CET extreme values of their whole record 1878–2006 (6(e)) show marked contrast between T min and T max . The KL
gain from the ρ(t, T max ) is highly cyclic, with strong peaks at 1895, 1918, 1955, and 1990, which suggest a connection
to the oscillation present in ρ(t, T max ). The 1990 peak is the highest, conﬁrming that ρ(1990, T max ) is the most distantly
related PDF to the complete record’s PDF, again suggesting that recent T max climatology is distinctly diﬀerent from

the century that preceded it. The KL gain from ρ(t, T min ) to the complete record’s ρ(T min ) has high peaks around 1895
and 1995, with weaker variability imposed on a trough spanning 1905–1980. Again, this suggests any thirty year
period centered on one of the years 1905–1980 is much more representative than the peaks at either end of the record.
For the period 1980–1995 the KL gain required to predict ρ(T min ) from ρ(t, T min ) is nearly as high as the highest value
seen in 1895, and suggests that recent T min climatology is again relatively alien compared to the full record.
Figures 6 (b,d,f) collectively answer Q4 for the CET monthly T avg and daily (T avg ,T min , T max ). That is, how much
additional information is needed to predict ρ(t, T ), given the full record’s PDF ρ(T )? The CET monthly data show
KL gain to any thirty year sample-generated rho(t, T avg ) from the full and preindustrial PDFs to be large for the early,
deprecated part of the record and the period after 1975. There is a long trough covering 1740–1975 with some weaker
variability superimposed on it, (Figure ??). This is true for the full-sample and preindustrial PDFs. Signiﬁcantly, the
strongest signiﬁcant values for these KL gains lie in the period after 1975, again demonstrating that recent climatology
is more odd than any other thirty year period. For the daily CET T avg the KL gain to rho(t, T avg ) from the full record
and preindustrial era samples (Figure 6(d)) identify the period after 1980 as being the most distantly related full and
preindustrial records. The gains necessary to predict recent sample PDFs from the full and preindustrial records are
dramatically greater than those seen for the 1910–1950 warming period. It is no surprise that the information gain
required to predict ρ(t, T avg ) the preindustrial sample rises steadily from the year 1870 forward, a consequence of the
p- and q- sampling windows becoming disjoint after 1900 and then being separated by increasing time lags up to the
present. The respite from this rising trend is of course associated with the 1950–1975 cooling/stabilization period.
The information gain from the PDF of the full daily CET extrama record 1878–2006 to any thirty-year windowed PDF
(Figure 6(f)) is structurally similar to Figure 6(e), but with slightly lower peaks. This is because the q-window used
to generate the full PDF contains the reference PDF’s p-window as a subset. Note again that the full record’s PDF has
the most trouble predicting PDFs generated from windows centered on years after 1985, identifying the climatology
of daily CET extreme temperatures as distinctly odd with respect to the full observational record.
The answer to Q5 can be found by computing time-shifted KLD values that compare each thirty-year window
present in an observational record. Analysis of these results will provide clues to whether we can answer Q6 as
well. Time-shifted KLD values for the daily CET are shown in Figure 7. These plots have as ordinate (abcissa) the
center year tq (t p ) of a thirty-year sampling window used to generate the PDF ρ(tq , T ) (ρ(t p , T )). The value plotted
at the point (tq , t p ) is DKL (p q); these values are zero on the line tq = t p because DKL (p p) = 0. For a ﬁxed
value of tq , points vertically above (below) the point (tq , tq ) signify the ability of this windowed PDF to predict future
(past) climate PDFs. The CET daily T avg time-shifted KLD results (Figure 7(a)) reveal a block-diagonal structure
comprising multiple low-KLD-value regions; these correspond to periods of relative climate PDF stability in that
any 30-year window from this range can with relatively high skill predict another 30-year windowed PDF in this
range. Stable time ranges identiﬁed are 1800–1850, 1830–1910, 1910–1950, and 1950–1975. Note that some of
these intervals touch or overlap; overlapping intervals signify a gentler transition in terms of PDF structure, while
touching intervals indicate a more abrupt change in PDF structure. These results are consistent with Figure 4(a).
Oﬀ-diagonal blocks of low KLD values indicate periodicity expressed as similarities from windowed PDFs from one
period versus another. In particular, the intervals 1950–1970 and 1830–1870 generate similar PDFs. Note further that

there is only a modest diagonal band after the year 1980, indicating relatively rapid change in ρ(t, T avg ) during this
period. Finally, note that the highest time-shifted KLD values are in vertical (horizontal) bands deﬁned by tq > 1980
(t p > 1980), indicating that climate PDFs centered on the period after 1980 are distinctly diﬀerent from pre-twentieth
century climate. Time-shifted KLD values for the CET daily T min record (Figure 7(b)) show a narrow block-diagonal
structure, indicating a series of overlapping short periods of relative PDF stability. Strong contrasts between the
warming period of the early twentieth century and mid-century cooling/stabilization period that follow it are evident
in relatively strong KLD values. The sampling period after 1980 again appears distinctly diﬀerent from most other
time periods. The time-shifted KLD values for T max (Figure 7(c)) show a diagonal band whose width varies from
5 to 15 years, with some block-diagonal structures associated with the periods 1910–1930, 1940–1960, and 1960–
1975. These periods are times of relatively slow change in ρ(t, T max ) Oﬀ diagonal low-KLD-value blocks indicate
periodicity with the intervals 1930–1950 and 1960–1980 appearing related. Oﬀ-diagonal high-KLD blocks indicate
a strong divergence between the statistics associated with the sampling periods centered on the intervals 1910–1925
and 1945–1960. Finally, note the strong divergence between PDFs associated with sampling windows centered on
years after 1980 and the rest of the record, again signalling a fundamental shift in the structure of ρ(t, T max ).
6. Conclusions and Future Work
An exploratory data analysis/information theoretic framework to analyze climate variability has been developed
and applied to the Central England Temperature Record. Viewing the 30-year windowed PDFs has provided at-aglance deep insight into the evolution of CET monthly- and daily- average and daily extreme temperatures. The
KLD-based measures of representativeness and oddness put the climate of the past thirty years in stark contrast with
respect to the full and preindustrial observational records. The climatology of CET average, maximum, and minimum
temperatures are distinctly diﬀerent from previous observed times. Time-shifted KLD metrics have identiﬁed periods
of relative climatic stability and of rapid change, again casting the climate of recent decades as distinctly diﬀerent and
changing relatively rapidly.

The results reported here are preliminary. Areas of future investigation include alternative density estimation
techniques to verify these results, development of automatic feature detection schemes to identify periods of climatic
stability and change, and applying these techniques to larger observational and model-generated data sets.
