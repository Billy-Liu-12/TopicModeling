Abstract. A stochastic two-state epidemiological cellular automaton
model is studied, where sites move between susceptible and infected
states. Each time step has two phases: an infectious phase, followed by a
treatment or recovery phase. During the infectious phase, each infected
site stochastically infects its susceptible neighbors. During the recovery
phase, contiguous blocks of sites are reset to the susceptible state, representing spatially clustered treatment or recovery. The spatially extended
recovery events are coordinated events over groups of cells larger than
standard local neighborhoods typically used in cellular automata models. This model, which exhibits complex spatial dynamics, is investigated
using simulations, mean ﬁeld approximations, and local structure theory,
also known as pair approximation in the ecological literature. The spatial
scale and geometry of recovery events aﬀects the equilibrium distribution of the model, even when the probability of block recovery events
is rescaled to maintain a constant per-site recovery probability per time
step. Spatially clustered treatments reduce the equilibrium proportion
of infected invididuals, compared to spatially more evenly distributed
treatment eﬀorts.

Introduction

Consider a discrete-time lattice-based epidemiological model, where each site
can be in one of two states: susceptible and infected. Infection and recovery
parameters are φ and µ, respectively. During each time step, the following two
things occur, in this order:
•

•

Infection: every infected site will infect each of its susceptible neighbors,
independently with probability φ each. The standard von Neumann neighborhood was used, consisting of the four orthogonal neighbors of a site.
If an infected site tries to infect an already-infected neighbor, there is no
eﬀect.
Recovery: contiguous blocks of sites recover simultaneously. Parameters b1
and b2 specify the dimensions of recovery blocks. Each block will consist of
a b1 ×b2 (rows × columns) block of sites or a b2 ×b1 block of sites, each with

probability 0.5. During the recovery phase, each site, independently with
probability γ (computed from µ as described in the section “Pair Approximations” below), will have a recovery block placed so that its upper-left
corner is located at the target site being considered. Note that multiple
recovery blocks within a time step may spatially overlap.
This is a discrete-time analogue of a continuous-time population model investigated in [1]. While qualitative results are similar in the two models, many
of the details of the analysis diﬀer, being more complex for the discrete-time
model.

Simulations

Simulations were performed on a 300 × 300 lattice with wraparound (toroidal)
boundary conditions. After each time step, the proportions of sites in the susceptible and infected states were recorded. Based on methods used by [2] to test
for equilibrium, beginning on time step 1000, on every time step a least-squares
regression line was ﬁt to the most recent 100 measurements of the proportion
of sites infected. When the slope of this line was less than 0.001, and the diﬀerence between the minimum and maximum proportion of infected sites over the
previous 100 time steps was less than 0.03, the system was considered to have
reached equilibrium. After it was determined that equilibrium was reached, the
simulation was run for another 50 time-steps, and the proportion of infected sites
was averaged over those ﬁnal 50 time steps and recorded as the ﬁnal proportion
of infected sites for the simulation. Although exploration showed that the model
was not sensitive to initial conditions, in order to reduce the time needed to reach
equilibrium, the equilibrium predicted by the local-dispersal mean-ﬁeld approximation [3] was used as the initial proportion of infected individuals. However,
if this initial proportion was less than 0.1, then 0.1 was used instead, to prevent
ﬁxation to a lattice completely in the susceptible state solely due to ﬂuctuations
from an initial small population of infected sites.

Pair Approximation

Let 0 represent the susceptible state, and 1 the infected state. The state of
the lattice can be approximately described by the probabilities P [ij] (where
i, j ∈ {0, 1}) that a pair of adjacent sites are in the state conﬁgurations 00, 01,
i
10, and 11. Assuming rotational symmetry, P [01] = P [10] (as well as P
=
j
P [ij]), and using the fact that the four probabilities must sum to one, only two
independent probabilities are needed to describe the state of the system, for
example P [00] and P [01]. The other two probabilities may then be computed
as P [10] = P [01] and P [11] = 1 − P [00] − P [01] − P [10] = 1 − P [00] − 2P [01].
Marginal probabilities of the possible states for a single site can be recovered by
summing over block probabilities, P [i] = P [i0] + P [i1] for i ∈ {0, 1}.

As described in [3], based on ideas explored in [4, 5], the block probabilities
Pt+1 [ij] at time t + 1 can be estimated using the current probabilities Pt [ij] by
ﬁrst estimating the probabilities of all pre-images of a pair of sites, and then
applying the cellular automaton rule to those pre-images and using the law of
total probability. A pre-image of a pair of sites is a set of state conﬁgurations of
the group of sites which the target pair of sites depends on when updating its
states, as shown in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. The group of sites in a pre-image of a pair of sites is shown. A pre-image is the
set of states of all sites which the target pair of sites depend on when updating their
states, i.e. all neighbors of the pair of target sites. The probabilities of all pre-images
are estimated, and then used to compute probabilities of all state conﬁgurations of a
pair of sites after the infectious phase of a time step, Pt+ 1 [ij]. The probabilities after
2
the recovery phase, Pt+1 [ij] are then computed

The pair approximation used here assumes that non-adjacent sites are independent when conditioned on any shared neighbors, i.e.

jk
.
= P [ijk] = P [ij·]P [· · k|ij·] = P [ij]P [· · k| · j·] =
i ·
P [j]

(1)

In the expression above, the conditional probability that the third site is in state
k given the states of the other two sites are i and j does not depend on the
ﬁrst site’s state because the ﬁrst and third sites are not adjacent. See e.g. [6, 7]
for a discussion of these methods applied to continuous-time epidemiological
models. Note that hereafter, 0/0 is deﬁned to be 0 in (1) when extending block
probabilities, since if P [j] = 0, then P [ij] = 0 and P [ijk] = 0 for all i, k ∈ {0, 1}.
Heuristically, the probability of a 3 × 1 block may be built up by covering it
with two overlapping 2 × 1 blocks, multiplying the 2 × 1 block probabilities and
dividing by the overlapping single-site probability. The 2 × 1 probabilities may
be repeatedly extended in this manner to build up probabilities of ever-larger
blocks [3, 8]. However, as also seen with many information-theoretic measures of
spatial complexity [9], in two or more dimensions, there can be more than one
way to cover larger blocks of sites with 2 × 1 sites [3], and thus there is not a
unique way to estimate the probabilities of pre-images. This can be seen when
trying to compute the probability of a 2 × 2 block:

where the ﬁrst probability has been expanded using (1), and the second probability has been approximated by assuming that the site labelled c does not
depend on the non-adjacent site labelled b, and then expanding the results using
the elementary deﬁnition of conditional probability. The sum in the denominator of the ﬁnal expression may be calculated using (1). The non-uniqueness of
this method may be seen by observing that in the calculation above, c was the
“last” site added into the block when expanding the 2×2 block probability using
a conditional probability; if instead d were the last site considered, a diﬀerent
expression would result. There is no clear way to choose one method over the
other; one could choose whichever term maximizes entropy of the resulting block
probabilities, but (2) was used in this study.
Because of the nature of the update rule used, computation of the new probabilities Pt+1 [ij] in terms of the current probabilities Pt [ij] may also be broken
into the two phases of infection and recovery.
For the infectious phase, the probabilities of all possible pre-images as shown
in the center of Fig. 1 are needed. Following the discussion above, the probability
extension used here was

. The probabilities of pre-images given by (3) may
·g
therefore be estimated using only the current 2 × 1 block probabilities.
Once the pre-image probabilities have been estimated, the probabilities
Pt+ 12 [ij] after the infectious phase of the time step may then be computed,
by conditioning on the pre-image at time t:
and similarly for P

Pt+ 12 [ij] =

Pt (G)P (G → [ij])

(4)

G∈G

where G is the set of all pre-images, Pt (G) is the probability of pre-image G,
and P (G → [ij]) is the probability that pre-image G results in the state [ij] for
the target pair of sites after the infectious phase. Because there are 8 sites in
the pre-image, and two states per site, there are 28 = 256 pre-images in total.
Because only infections occur during this phase, if c = 1 and i = 0, or f = 1 and
j = 0 in Fig. 1, then P (G → [ij]) = 0. Otherwise, the probability will be based
on binomial distributions. Let kL (G) = a + b + d + f be the number of neighbors
of the left site c which are occupied in the pre-image G, and kR (G) = c+e+g +h
be the number of neighbors of the right site f which are occupied.

If c = 0 and f = 0, then P (G → [00]) = (1 − φ)kL (G) (1 − φ)kR (G) , and
P (G → [01]) = (1 − φ)kL (G) (1 − (1 − φ)kR (G) ).
If c = 0 and f = 1, then P (G → [00]) = 0, and P (G → [01]) = (1−φ)kL (G) .
If c = 1 and f = 0, or if c = 1 and f = 1, then P (G → [00]) = P (G →
[01]) = 0.

Once the probabilities Pt+ 12 [ij] have been estimated using (4) together with
the above information, the ﬁnal probabilities Pt+1 [ij] may then be estimated by
applying the recovery phase of the cellular automaton rule. Because the application of recovery blocks is externally imposed and does not depend on the current
states of cells or their neighbors, extension of block probabilities is not needed for
this phase. Only the application of basic probability is needed, to compute the
probabilities that among a pair of sites, neither, one, or both sites are contained
within a recovery block. Sites may be part of a recovery block if any of several
nearby sites are the target of such a block. For example, consider the case where
b1 = 2 and b2 = 3, i.e. 2 × 3 and 3 × 2 recovery blocks are used. For the pair
of sites drawn in bold in Fig. 2, recovery blocks at any of the labelled sites will
aﬀect one or both sites in the pair, as follows:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Both 2 × 3 and 3 × 2 blocks targetted at sites A will aﬀect only the right
site of the pair.
Both 2 × 3 and 3 × 2 blocks targetted at sites B will aﬀect both sites of the
pair.
3 × 2 blocks at site C will aﬀect the right site of the pair, but 2 × 3 blocks
will not aﬀect the pair.
3 × 2 blocks at site D will aﬀect both sites of the pair, but 2 × 3 blocks will
not aﬀect the pair.
2 × 3 blocks at sites E will aﬀect both sites of the pair, but 3 × 2 blocks
will aﬀect only the left site of the pair.
2 × 3 blocks at sites F will aﬀect the left site of the pair, but 3 × 2 blocks
will not aﬀect the pair.
3 × 2 blocks at site G will aﬀect the left site of the pair, but 2 × 3 blocks
will not aﬀect the pair.

Similar enumerations can be performed for any values of b1 and b2 . This information may then be used to calculate the probabilities that particular sites in a
pair are aﬀected by one or more blocks. Such calculations show that the probability that both sites in a pair will be aﬀected by one or more recovery blocks is
P ([11] → [00]) = 1 + Ac1 B c2 (Ac3 B c4 − 2)

(5)

where A = 1 − γ, B = 1 − γ/2, c1 = (bmin ) , c2 = 2(bmax − bmin )bmin , c3 = bmin ,
and c4 = bmax − bmin , bmin = min(b1 , b2 ) and bmax = max(b1 , b2 ). Similarly, the
probability that the left site in a pair will be aﬀected by one or more recovery
blocks, but that the right site will not be aﬀected by any blocks, is
P ([11] → [01]) = Ac1 B c2 (1 − Ac3 B c4 )

(6)

Combining the two, the probability that any single site will be aﬀected by one
or more recovery blocks is
P ([1] → [0]) = 1 − Ac1 B c2

(7)

We wish the single-site recovery probability to be µ, but because a site may
recover due to being hit by recovery blocks targeted at any number of neighboring
sites, the recovery probability is altered. To correct for this, we use (7) to deﬁne
f (γ) = 1 − (1 − γ)c1 (1 − γ/2)c2 , and then numerically solve for the value γ
satisfying f (γ) = µ. This value γ is the adjusted recovery probability used in all
simulations and approximations of the model; it is the recovery block probability
which yields a single-site recovery probability of µ per time step.

site labels

This adjustment of recovery rates is simpler in continuous-time models, where
the recovery rate merely needs to be divided by b1 b2 , the size of the recovery
blocks [1]. In the discrete-time model, however, if this rescaling is used, the number of recovery blocks aﬀecting a single site approaches a Poisson distribution as
the block sizes become large, and the single-site recovery probability approaches
1 − e−µ , thus making the more complex rescaling above necessary.
The recovery probabilities above in (5)–(7) may be combined with the infection probabilities given by (4) to compute the updated probabilities on the next
time step, as follows:
Pt+1 [00] = Pt+ 12 [00] + 2Pt+ 12 [01]P ([1] → [0]) + Pt+ 12 [11]P ([11] → [00])
Pt+1 [01] = Pt+ 12 [01](1 − P ([1] → [0])) + Pt+ 12 [11]P ([11] → [01])

Results

Equilibrium proportions of sites infected are shown for φ = 0.5, as the persite recovery rate µ was varied between 0 and 1, for n × n recovery blocks in
Fig. 3 and 1 × n recovery blocks in Fig. 4. Results are shown for simulations,
pair approximations, and the mean-ﬁeld approximation, for which the rate of
recovery only depends on the single-site rate given by (7). Note that the meanﬁeld approximation is not dependent on the size of recovery blocks because it is
a spatially implicit method which ignores all spatial correlations; thus only one
mean-ﬁeld curve appears in the ﬁgures. Errors in the predictions, i.e. the pair

It can be seen from the ﬁgures that the geometry of recovery events does
aﬀect the equilibrium distribution, even when the single-site recovery probability
is held constant. This eﬀect is more pronounced for square recovery blocks than
for long, narrow blocks. For a disease with only local infection and a regular
treatment regime, the long-term prevalence of the disease would be reduced by
focusing treatment in fewer contiguous areas, rather than distributing treatment
more evenly throughout the population.

As with the continuous-time version of the model, the pair approximations
do fairly well at predicting simulation results. They do most poorly near the critical value of the recovery rate at which the equilibrium proportion of infected
individuals transitions between 0 and a positive value, when spatial correlations
decay more slowly with distance over spatial scales beyond that reﬂected by the
pair approximation [1]. Also, as can be seen in Fig. 3b, the pair approximations
become less accurate as the spatial scale of the recovery blocks becomes larger.
The pair approximations are more accurate for long 1 × n blocks as compared
with square n × n blocks (compare the scales of the y-axes in Figs. 3b and 4b),
and are also more accurate over a wider range of values of the rescaled recovery
rate γ. Although in continuous time, pair approximations tend to almost always
overestimate the equilibrium proportion of infected sites, in the discrete-time
model it can be clearly seen from the ﬁgures that the pair approximation underestimates this value over a signiﬁcant range of the parameter space. Further
investigation is needed to determine exactly why the more complex interactions
in the discrete-time model give rise to this behavior.
