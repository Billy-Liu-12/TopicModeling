Abstract. In this paper, we propose a second–order parameter–uniform
convergent hybrid scheme for self–adjoint singular perturbation problems
(SPPs) subject to mixed (Robin) type conditions. The cubic spline baesd
diﬀerence scheme is combined with the classical central diﬀerence scheme
to obtain monotone scheme. Numerical example is provided to support
the theory.
Keywords: Finite diﬀerence scheme, cubic splines, singular perturbation problems, piece-wise uniform meshes.
Subject Classification: AMS 65L10 CR G1.7.

Introduction

Singular perturbation problems (SPPs) arise in several branches of engineering
and applied mathematics which include ﬂuid dynamics, quantum mechanics,
elasticity, chemical reactor theory, gas porous electrodes theory, etc. To solve
these types of problems various methods are proposed in the literature, more
details can be found in the books of Farrell et al. [2], and Roos et al. [6].
We consider the following singularly perturbed self–adjoint boundary–value
problem (BVP):
Lu(x) ≡ −εu (x) + b(x)u(x) = f (x),
α1 u(0) − β1 u (0) = A,

x ∈ D = (0, 1)

α2 u(1) + β2 u (1) = B,

(1)
(2)

where α1 , β1 , α2 , β2 > 0 and ε > 0 is a small parameter, b and f are suﬃciently smooth functions, such that b(x) ≥ β > 0 on D = [0, 1]. Under these
assumptions, the BVP (1-2) possesses a unique solution u(x) ∈ C 2 (D) ∩ C 1 (D).
In general, the solution u(x) may exhibit two boundary layers of exponential
type at both end points x = 0, 1. Boundary-value problems of the type (1-2)
arise in many applications, for instance, conﬁnement of a plasma column by
reaction pressure, theory of gas porous electrodes, performance of catalytic pellets and geophyisical ﬂuid dynamics chemical reactions [1, 5]. In [3], the authors

have devised HODIE schemes for singularly perturbed convection-diﬀusion and
reaction-diﬀusion problems respectively.
For suﬃciently small ε , classical methods on uniform meshes only work
for very large number of mesh points. Nevertheless, if these methods are deﬁned on special ﬁtted meshes, the convergence to the exact solution is uniform
in ε. Shishkin meshes are simple piecewise uniform meshes of this kind, frequently used for singularly perturbed problems. For above mentioned problem,
The Shishkin mesh Ω is constructed as follows. The domain Ω is divided into
three subintervals as Ω = [0, σ] ∪ [σ, 1 − σ] ∪ [1 − σ, 1] for some σ such that
0 < σ ≤ 1/4. On the subintervals [0, σ], [1 − σ, 1] a uniform mesh with N/4
mesh–intervals is placed, where [σ, 1 − σ] has a uniform mesh with N/2 mesh
intervals. It is obvious that the mesh is uniform
√ when σ = 1/4, and it is ﬁtted to the problem by choosing σ = min 14 , σ0 ε ln N ,where σ0 is a constant
will be ﬁxed later. Further, we denote the mesh size in the regions[σ, 1 − σ] as
h(1) = 2(1 − 2σ)/N , and in [0, σ], [1 − σ, 1] by h(2) = 4σ/N . Here, we propose an
hybrid scheme which is a mixture of the cubic spline scheme with the classical
central diﬀerence scheme for the BVP (1-2) on above mentioned Shishkin mesh.
We apply the cubic spline diﬀerence scheme in the inner region(0, σ) ∪ (1 − σ, 1),
whereas in the outer region (σ, 1 − σ) we use the classical central diﬀerence
scheme. This is mainly because to retain the discrete maximum principle of the
diﬀerence scheme. The present method provides second–order uniform convergence throughout the domain of interest. A numerical experiment have been
carried out to show the eﬃciency of the method.

ε-Uniform Hybrid Scheme

The cubic spline based scheme is analyzed for stability and convergence and it is
observed that for the corresponding matrix to be a M-matrix, a very restrictive
condition is needed on the mesh size, specially in the outer region where a coarse
mesh is enough to reﬂect the behavior of the solution in that region . So, to
overcome this, The following hybrid scheme is proposed in which the well known
classical central diﬀerence scheme is taken in the outer region and the cubic
spline scheme in boundary layer region

Conclusions

In this paper, We have proposed a hybrid method for the numerical solution
of singularly perturbed reaction–diﬀusion problems. The underlying idea of the
method combines both the cubic spline and classical central diﬀerence scheme.
The method is of second–order convergent. One test example is studied to verify
the eﬃciency and accuracy of the theoretical error estimates, and they reﬂect
perfectly the same.
