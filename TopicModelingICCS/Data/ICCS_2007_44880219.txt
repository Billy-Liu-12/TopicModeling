Introduction

Water slides are one of the most popular facilities in water parks. They are
built all over the world. One of the most important problems associated with
them is safety. It is not well recognized, both mathematically and technically.
There are very few scientiﬁc papers concerning the problem. The most complete
publication [1] deals with the mathematical model of a water sliding process
using the assumption that the user has constant contact with the inner surface of
the chute. Actually, the most dangerous situations happen when the user looses
contact and cannot control the ride. The next problem is acceleration, often
called G-load. The human body, and especially brain and heart, is sensitive to
acceleration that signiﬁcantly exceeds gravity acceleration g. Several accidents,
in a variety of countries resulted in severe injuries and even death.
The contemporary practice, due to lack of design methodology, consists in
testing by a water slides expert after ﬁnishing the construction, however this
expert is described only as a ﬁt person, dressed in bathing suit [2]. It is not
acceptable from the point of view of modern engineering philosophy, which requires prior analysis based on mathematical model, which should be veriﬁed
experimentally.

Typical Geometry of Water Slides

Most of the water slides (especially those built high over the ground level) are
constructed of two basic types of elements: the straight ones, being just a simple
cylinder, and the curved ones, having the shape of a slice of a torus. All these
elements are equipped on both ends with ﬂanges that allow connecting the following parts of the slide with screws (see Fig. 1 and 2). Because the resulting
axis of the chute consists of straight lines and circular arcs, it can’t be described
by a simple equation, but some kind of an interval changing function is needed.

The best choice seems to be the IntepolatingFunction within the Mathematica system. To obtain a parametric equation of the axis, one must ﬁrst
calculate a set of coordinates of discrete points, lying on the axis at small intervals. It can be done using procedures described in [3] or with the aid of any
software for 3-D graphics. The next step is to build an IntepolatingFunction
for each of the coordinates separately and ﬁnally join them into one vector function axis[l]. Having this function one can get the parametric equation of the
surface of the slide surface[l,phi,radius] using the following Mathematica
code:

Safety of Recreational Water Slides

surface[l_, phi_, radius_] := axis[l] +
radius * Module[{vecda, lda13, lda12},
vecda = axis’[l];
lda13 = Sqrt[Sum[vecda[[i]]^2, {i, 3}]];
lda12 = Sqrt[Sum[vecda[[i]]^2, {i, 2}]];
{{vecda[[1]] / lda13, -vecda[[2]] / lda12,
-(vecda[[1]]*vecda[[3]])/(lda13*lda12)},
{vecda[[2]] / lda13, vecda[[1]] / lda12,
-(vecda[[2]] * vecda[[3]]) / (lda13 * lda12)},
{vecda[[3]] / lda13, 0, lda12 / lda13)}}
].{0, Cos[phi], Sin[phi]}] .
Within the above code l denotes the position of a current cross-section,
measured along the axis, phi and radius are cylindrical coordinates of points
creating the cross-section. Figure 2 has been created with this code and the
ParametricPlot3D command.

Model of a Sliding Person

The next task is to create a model of the human body. It’s obvious, that a
complete bio-mechanical model with all its degrees of freedom (DOF) and parameters would be the best, but unfortunately it’s almost impossible to predict
the values of dimensions, mass, moments of inertia and stiﬀness of all parts of
the users’ body, especially at the design stage of the construction process. That’s
why a simpler model is needed.
To create it, one can notice, that sliding people are quite stiﬀened and the
fastest users touch the surface of the chute only with their heels and bladebones. This allows us to replace the sliding person by a rigid body, constrained
by 3 unilateral supports located at the vicinity of the previous mentioned parts
of the body (spheres at the vertices of the triangle representing the body on
Fig. 3). Such a body has 6 DOFs - translations xi and rotations θi around 3
axes of the local (ξi ) or global (Xi ) coordinates system, and is subjected to the
inﬂuence of the following forces: gravity F G , normal contact forces F Ni and
friction forces F Ti , shown on Fig. 4. Vectors of these forces can be calculated
using the following formulae:
F Ni =

0 if (ui < 0) ∨ [(k ui + c ui u˙ i ) < 0]
,
(k ui + c ui u˙ i ) ni otherwise
F Ti = −μ |F Ni |

where:
i − number of the current zone of contact,
k, c − constants of the quasi viscous-elastic model of human body,
ui − “deﬂection” of the zone of contact,
ni − unit vector, normal to the surface of the slide,
μ − coeﬃcient of friction,
v Ti − tangent component of the velocity vector,
m − mass of the user,
g − vector of gravitational acceleration,
F Sum − summary force,
M Sum − summary moment of forces.
At this stage the main problem is calculating ui and ni . The best way to solve
it, is to ﬁnd on the axis of the slide these points, that are nearest to the current

positions of the centers of the contact spheres, because vectors ni must lie on
lines connecting these pairs of points. It can be easily done with the Mathematica
FindMinimum command.

where:
K(t) − vector of moment of momentum,
A(t) − matrix of transformation from local (rotating)
to global (ﬁxed) coordinates system,
J − tensor of main moments of inertia,
ω(t) − vector of angular velocity.
As one can see, the equations of motion are so complicated, that it is impossible to obtain an analytical solution. In fact, even NDSolve, the numerical
solution of diﬀerential equations in Mathematica, does not work due to the usage of the FindMinimum command within the equations of motion (see Sect. 3).
So a special code had to be written, and it follows an algorithm based on a
combination of the Taylor’s series and multi-step methods [5]:

Input -> totalTime, deltaT, initialcoordinates, initialvelocity,
function acceleration[coordinates, velocities];
steps = totalTime / deltaT;
coord[[1]] = initialcoordinates;
vel[[1]] = initialvelocity;
acc[[1]] = acceleration[coord[[1]],vel[[1]]];
coord[[2]] = coord[[1]] + vel[[1]] * deltaT
+ 0.5 acc[[1]] * deltaT^2;
vel[[2]] = vel[[1]] + acc[[1]] * deltaT;
Do[acc[[i]] = acceleration[coord[[i]],vel[[i]]];
coord[[i+1]] = 2 * coord[[i]] - coord[[i-1]]
+ acc[[i]] * deltaT^2;
vel[[i]] = 0.5 (coord[[i+1]] - coord[[i-1]]) / deltaT,
{i, 2, steps + 1}];
Output -> lists: coord[[i]], vel[[i]], acc[[i]].
Of course, each single element of the output lists coord[[i]], vel[[i]] and
acc[[i]] is a 6 dimensional vector. This code seems to be stable and a suﬃcient
precision is reached with deltaT = 0.002 [second].

Sample Results

Some sample results were obtained for the slide shown in Fig. 2. There is shown
the trajectory of the motion and the axis of the slide in Fig. 5. The beginning
is at the point (0,0), and then the body goes along the direction of the X2 axis,
next turns left and follows the curved axis of the slide, slightly swinging. More

value of velocity and ﬁrst and second angular coordinates (longitudinal and
transversal rotations around ξ1 and ξ2 axes - see Fig. 3), where on the horizontal
axes of these charts is marked the length of the chute.
The current design code [2] sets some limitations on the values of permissible
G-load for safety reasons. It says, that G ≤ 2.6 g is safe, and 2.6 g < G ≤ 4.0 g is
acceptable, but only for less then 0.1 second. Within the presented example these
limitations are kept, but sometimes it is hard to do so. Especially the second
condition can cause some problems when designing a very steep and fast water
slide, where the high speed generates huge centrifugal force at each bend.

Conclusions

Numerical modelling of motion is a good method of checking the geometry of
water slides during the design process. It allows to estimate the excitement level
of the ride, which is dependent on speed and acceleration, and points out the
dangerous parts of the slide, where the value of G-load is to high (exceeds 2.6 or
4.0 g). The applied algorithms are user-friendly, and the results of computations
can be presented in many forms, beginning from pure numbers and ending on
pictures like Fig. 7 and animations of the motion.
