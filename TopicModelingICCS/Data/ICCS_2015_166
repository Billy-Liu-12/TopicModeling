Abstract
This article presents a concept of decision support system for emergency Ô¨Çood embankment
stability. The proposed methodology is based on the analysis of data from both a Ô¨Çood embankment measurement network and generated through numerical modeling. Decisions about
the risk of embankment failure are made based on this analysis. The authors present both
the general concept of the system as well as a preliminary detailed description of the system
components.
Keywords: automatic data analysis, decision-making system, time series analysis

Introduction

Protection against Ô¨Çooding in built-up areas is especially important due to the increasing number of Ô¨Çoods in urban areas and the increasing scale of economic and social consequences caused
by Ô¨Çoods. Flood threat monitoring systems have been the subject of research in the framework
of two European projects: UrbanFlood and Ijkdijk [1, 3, 5, 7, 8]. These projects developed
experimental Ô¨Çood embankments with mounted sensor networks, which measure pore pressure,
temperature and inclination [7]. These three parameters make it possible to assess the stability
of Ô¨Çood embankments. The same necessity has been also recognized in Poland and in response
to these needs the strategic project, implemented by an academic-industrial consortium and
funded by the National Centre of Research and Development within the Applied Research Programme that has been launched. In order to create an automatic system to assess the state
of Ô¨Çood embankment in Poland the Computer System for Monitoring River Levees (ISMOP)
project was established [9, 6]. The main purpose of the project is to enable the development of
a complex system that can help the authorities protect civilians against Ô¨Çooding by providing
current information about the dynamics and intensity of processes within Ô¨Çood embankments.
An experimental Ô¨Çood embankment (a full-size Ô¨Çood embankment at Czernich¬¥ow near Krakow)
will be built as a part of the ISMOP project. This project is particularly important because
it will provide future monitoring network in the critical areas of the Ô¨Çood disaster. The constructed embankment is built n the test area, nonetheless in the case of success of the project,

network
these solution will be implemented across the country. The installed measurement network
involves more than 50 points sensors and two optical Ô¨Åber sensors stretched along the embankment. The point sensors are distributed at diÔ¨Äerent heights, so that the measurements can be
carried out in cross sections. Time step in measurements may be changed during the experiment from 1 to 60 minutes. The idea is to examine the varability of the temperature as well as
the pore pressure values on the embankment stability and capture the changes of parameters
in the moment of embankment failure. A cross-section of the experimental Ô¨Çood embankment

An outline of the system for the analysis of Ô¨Çood data

Evaluation of experimental Ô¨Çood embankments condition will be based on the analysis of data
retrieved from sensors located inside the Ô¨Çood embankment (Fig. 1), and measurements performed on and around its surface. The analysis will also involve the use of data retrieved from
numerical modelling, which depicts possible changes in Ô¨Çood embankment behavior due to various internal parameters and variable external conditions. The proposed work Ô¨Çow divides data
processing algorithms into modules (Fig. 2). Data measured with the use of real sensors will be
converted and interpreted automatically with methods suitable for the analysis of multivariate
time series. Synthetic data is processed and interpreted in model based modules, which use
method of comparison and evaluation of model scenarios of Ô¨Çood embankment behavior. Information about the current condition of the Ô¨Çood embankment (and the short-term forecast) is
obtained in the decision support module.

2.1

A data-driven module for anomaly detection

This data-driven module is used for detecting anomalies in a given time-frame of measurements
from the sensors placed in the experimental Ô¨Çood embankment. The anomaly is deÔ¨Åned as a
deviation from of the standard system behaviour [4]. Input data to the anomaly detection
module are time series of constant length. For each sensor we have a time series of 100 observations (25h window length) of two parameters: temperature and pore pressure, with information
of sensor type and sensor position. The output data contain an anomaly report. The report
contains information about the possibility of anomaly occurrence in time series for every sensor,
with graphical presentation of results. In ISMOP project the preprocessed data were analyzed
in the anomaly detection module based on algorithm: validated data were stored in a database;
incorrect or missing data were replaced; data transformation was performed, including standardization necessary for the proper performance of the Fourier transform; the decomposition
of the time series into a few systematic components was performed, it is particularly useful for
data from temperature sensors placed in the subsurface of the embankment, for which there
is a periodicity associated with daily and seasonal cyclicality; a fast Fourier transform (F F T )

Figure 2: A model of proposed solution for a system construction for the analysis of Ô¨Çood data
was performed on the n observations of time series and a periodogram was analyzed to detect
changes in amplitude for a particular harmonic; non-stationarity in a time series could also be
detected by a time-varying periodogram used for the analysis, thereby indicating the occurrence
of harmful changes in the structure of the embankment; detection of non-stationarity in the
periodogram is achieved by analysis of changes in the high frequency range (rapidly rising and
falling spectral density values). The value was calculated according to the determination of
the model residuals, which is the diÔ¨Äerence between time series and the constructed model. If
the calculated value of the coeÔ¨Écient of determination is higher than 0.5, the residuals of the
model are normally distributed, and the variance of the residuals is constant in time than in the
analyzed time window, there is no anomaly. There is an anomaly if any of the above conditions
are not fulÔ¨Ålled in the analyzed time window. Information about the presence or absence of
anomalies for a given time frame is measured by sensors in an experimental embankment and
forwarded to the decision-making system to be compared with synthetic data.

2.2

Application of model-driven method to determine the synthetic
scenarios of embankment behavior

The second module of the system is used to identify synthetic models of embankment behavior
and to reproduce the behavior of embankments at failure risk, by deÔ¨Åning a set of models
describing changes in the dynamic state of the embankment. There are two types of input
data for model driven module: time series from real data from sensors and time series from
corresponding for sensors nodes. In the Ô¨Årst iteration of comparison of real data with simulated
data we got time series of 100 samples. In each iteration time series length increases, until the
similarity measure exceeds the threshold. Output data contain information to which scenario
time series from sensor are the most similar with information, about the scenario result. Also
some graphical representation of results. This stage of dynamic modeling involves preparation of
many simulation scenarios. A scenario is referred to as one type of Ô¨Çood wave transition (freshetstabilization of the water level (plateau)-falling water level). Each simulation relates to sensor
values for three cross-sections of the embankment. Embankment stability is analyzed with
the use of parameters (computed density, pore pressure, water saturation, plastic deformation
rate, temperature, horizontal stress, vertical stress, shear stress, displacement and vertical and
horizontal Ô¨Çow) calculated during the simulation. The aim of the authors was also to read
simulated parameters at the moment of embankment rupture. In this way the rules deÔ¨Åning
the moment of disaster were generated. The detailed description of the method is avalible at
preview reasearch and publications [9, 6, 2, 7]. These rules were then used in the decision2959

making system. Simulations are created using 2D FLAC Itasca software v7.0.

2.3

A description of a decision making module for the analysis of
Ô¨Çood risk

The authors assume that the decision-making system is the Ô¨Ånal module in the proposed system
for the analysis of Ô¨Çood embankment conditions(Fig. 2). It is based on the following assumptions: the rule based system will contain information obtained from human experts and the
knowledge based systems will contain information obtained from self-study and automatic exploration of input knowledge. Input data comes initially from the real data anomaly detection
module as well as numerical models of the behavior of Ô¨Çood embankments. It will be feeded
with a set of scenarios from a model-driven method. The dynamic numerical models of the Ô¨Çood
embankment (with simultaneous determination of failure risk), and also the use of data analysis
in the time window (anomaly detecion module) will be compared in order to Ô¨Ånd the similarity
between the behavior of the embankment‚Äôs state. In this way, the method can determine a
set of models that match the measurements (RISKN ). Secondly, this interpretative system is
supported by historical data, i.e. information about previously conducted experiments (according to the assumptions of the ISMOP project). This data are the basis of analogies between
the current condition of an embankment (and previous scenarios, thereby driving the systems
conclusions of its behavior during deÔ¨Åning various experimental conÔ¨Ågurations of boundary conditions during the experiment, RISKN and knowledge from historical data (temporary called
HD) ‚Äì it evaluates a new state RISKN + HD). The next data source is the weather forecasts
of e.g. The National Institute of Meteorology and Water Management (IMGW). The role of
the IMGW is to provide weather forecasts so the system can deÔ¨Åne any possible dangers, which
may aÔ¨Äect the stability of a Ô¨Çood embankment, resulting from e.g. increased precipitation,
which may aÔ¨Äect the humidity of a Ô¨Çood embankment. It will be supplied by the forward
inference with the manual rules (ER depends on precise statements about general rules of Ô¨Çood
embankment maintenance (e.g. a sudden increase of pore pressure may cause instability) from,
for example, geotechnical experts e.g.:
IF embnk_dislocation = high AND weather_forecast = heavy_rainfall THEN flood_emergency;

The results (RISKN + HD + ER) will provide last information on the possible embankment‚Äôs
state. The Ô¨Ånal number of states will depend on the number of expert rules, which are not yet
fully deÔ¨Åned, due to the preliminary phase of the project. The idea of a self-training system
assumes that further rules are obtained during the systems lifetime (knowledge is obtained
all the time and used immediately). This involves automatic evaluation of recognized anomalies in accordance with available models of Ô¨Çood embankment behavior. Based on the above,
the system, in Author‚Äôs opinion, will be able to calculate possible behavior scenarios of the
embankment.

Conclusions

The system presented and described above is still under development and testing. Because of the
very interesting results of Projects Ijkdijk and UrbanFlood, the idea of the proposed ISMOP
system is also based on application of combination data driven methods and model driven
methods [1, 3, 5, 8]. Some components of the proposed system currently work using knowledge
taken from experiments performed on various hydro engineering objects [3, 1], or using the
results of numerical modelling. The numerical models used for the simulation of dynamical

processes, the adequacy of the assumed geomechanical parameters, as well as the correctness of
the mathematical model of dynamical processes inside the simulated embankments are currently
being tested. The essential novelty of the proposed method of embankment analysis is the
application of the results of numerical simulations, which are calculated in advance and stored
in a special database. The result of each numerical simulation is a real time rendering of the
real processes of water inÔ¨Åltration, temperature change and stability loss of the earthen dam.
Appropriate simulations can be identiÔ¨Åed in a database much quicker than individual numerical
modelling can be evaluated, therefore making real time identiÔ¨Åcation possible. The database
containing the results of simulations of possible models allows allows creating rules, on which the
decision support system relies on. It is also important that the applied rules are veriÔ¨Åed using
data and results from past and future experiments performed on experimental embankments.
