Abstract
Inference problems in dynamically data-driven application systems use physical measurements
along with a physical model to estimate the parameters or state of a physical system. Errors
in measurements and uncertainties in the model lead to inaccurate inference results. This work
develops a methodology to estimate the impact of various errors on the variational solution
of a DDDAS inference problem. The methodology is based on models described by ordinary
diﬀerential equations, and use ﬁrst-order and second-order adjoint methodologies. Numerical
experiments with the heat equation illustrate the use of the proposed error estimation machinery.
Keywords: Inverse problems, sensitivity analysis, DDDAS, data assimilation, a posteriori error

Introduction

Dynamically data-driven application systems (DDDAS [1]) is a paradigm whereby simulations
and measurements become a symbiotic feedback control system. An important application of
DDDAS is the solution of inference problems where information from physical measurements
is combined with a mathematical model to obtain estimates of the state or parameters of a
physical system. In practice both the data and the model are imperfect, and the corresponding
errors directly impact the inference solution. This work discusses an a posteriori error estimation methodology to quantify the impact of data and model errors on speciﬁc aspects of the
inference solution. A posteriori error estimates can give valuable insights about the stability
and robustness of a DDDAS system. Our methodology is based on the variational framework
and can have numerous applications in DDDAS. Examples include data assimilation, the dynamic steering of the measurement process to improve the overall forecasts [7], and dynamic
location of faulty sensors.
A posteriori error estimation is a well established methodology in the context of ﬁnite
element approximations of partial diﬀerential equations [4]. A posteriori error estimators for
ﬁnite element methods in the solution of inverse problems are developed in [5, 6]. Related work
has been done in the context of variational data assimilation problems to quantify the impact of

errors in the background, observations, and associated covariances [8, 9, 11]. Optimal solution
error covariances for optimal control problems to estimate parameters, such as distributed
model coeﬃcients and boundary conditions for convection-diﬀusion model has been determined
in [10].
While previous work has considered methodologies to estimate the impact of data errors,
no method is available to date to estimate the impact of model errors on the optimal solution.
Previously, the second order adjoint information has been used to solve PDE constrained optimization problems in [14]. This paper develops a coherent framework to estimate the impact of
both model and data errors on the optimal solution. The computational procedure makes use
of ﬁrst order and the second order adjoint information and builds upon our previous work [16].
The paper is organized as follows. The DDDAS inference problem is introduced in Section
2. Section 3 describes the computational procedure for performing a posteriori error estimates.
Numerical results in support of theoretical results are presented in Section 4. Concluding
remarks are given in Section 5.

2.1

DDDAS inference
Fusing information from data and models

Data assimilation (DA) is the fusion of information from imperfect model predictions and
noisy data, to obtain a consistent description of the state of a physical system [2, 3]. Two
main approaches are in use for solving DA: variational and ensemble-based. The variational
approach is based on optimal control theory, whereas the ensemble-based approached is rooted
in statistical estimation theory. In this paper we focus on the variational approach. To obtain an
estimate of the true state of a system xtrue three diﬀerent sources of information are combined:
the prior information, the model, and the observations. The best estimate that optimally fuses
all these sources of information is called the analysis xa . The following subsections brieﬂy
describe the sources of information.
Prior information. The prior information encapsulates our current knowledge of the system. The prior information is captured by the background estimate of the state xb and the
corresponding background error covariance matrix B.
The model. The model captures our knowledge about the physical and chemical laws that
govern the evolution of the system. The model evolves an initial state x0 ∈ Rn at the initial
time t0 to future states xi ∈ Rn at future times ti . A general model equation is represented as
follows:
(1)
xi = Mt0 →ti (x0 ) .
The observations. Observations represent the snapshots of reality available at discrete time
instances. Speciﬁcally, measurements yi ∈ Rm of the physical state are taken at times ti , i =
1, · · · , N
, i = 1, · · · , N.
yi = Ht xtrue (ti ) − εmeas

The measurement errors can be attributed to faulty equipments. The representativeness errors

2.2

Four dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var)

Variational methods solve the data assimilation problem in an optimal control framework. One
ﬁnds the control variable which minimizes the mismatch between the model forecasts and the
observations. In strong-constraint 4D-Var, the control parameters are the initial conditions x0 ;
they uniquely determine the state of the system at all future times via the model equation (1).
The background state is the prior knowledge of the initial conditions xb0 . Given the background
value of the initial state xb0 , the covariance of the initial background errors B0 , the observations
yi at ti and the corresponding observation error covariances Ri , i = 1, · · · , N , the 4D-Var
problem provides the estimate xa0 of the true initial conditions by minimizing the following cost
function:

In this paper, we consider a model (1) whose dynamics is described by a system of linear
ordinary diﬀerential equations (ODEs)
x = Ax + b(t),

t0 ≤ t ≤ tF ,

x(t0 ) = x0

where x0 , the vector of initial conditions, is not known accurately. The 4D-Var cost function

The DDDAS inference problem of interest is formulated as follows:

The optimal solution for the inverse problem (6) can be found by using the adjoint sensitivity
approach described extensively in [12] and [13].
We are interested in estimating the impact of observation and model errors on the inference
result xa0 . Speciﬁcally, we will quantify the eﬀect of errors on a certain aspect of the result.
This quantity of interest is deﬁned via a scalar error functional E (xa0 ). In our case xa0 ∈ Rn .

used in DDDAS inference problems (6) have on a given aspect of the inference solution E (xa0 ).

The optimality equations are obtained by setting the variations of the Lagrangian (8) to zero.
The equation ∇x L = 0 leads to the following adjoint ODE model:

Similarly, setting ∇λ L = 0 we obtain the forward ODE model (4)
− x + Ax + b (t) = 0,

x(t0 ) = x0 .

Furthermore, setting ∇x0 L = 0 we obtain the optimality equation

The super-Lagrangian

We follow the work done in [6, 16] to develop a posteriori error estimates which are applicable to
our problem of interest. We ﬁrst construct the Lagrangian associated with the error functional
(24) and the constraints posed by the ﬁrst order optimality conditions (9):

A posteriori error estimation methodology

In practice, it is not possible for a model to completely represent the physics of reality. Consequently, the forward model (1) is inaccurate and subject to model errors. To describe this
inaccuracy we consider a forward model (4) that is marred by a time dependent model error
x = Ax + b (t) + Δb (t) ,

x (t0 ) = x0 .

(14)

Moreover, the observation data yi in (2) is imperfect and marred by (additional) errors Δyi .
This results in an error-marred cost function (3)

In practice, instead of the ideal DDDAS inference problem (6) one solves the perturbed

subject to (14) .
Our goal is to estimate the error in the optimal solution xa0 − xa0 . Speciﬁcally, we seek to
estimate the errors in the quantity of interest E (xa0 )
ΔE = E (xa0 ) − E (xa0 ) .
The solution of the perturbed DDDAS inference (17) is subject to a perturbed set of optimality conditions (9). The error contributions to the optimal solution come from the errors
in the adjoint model (9a), forward model (9b) and optimality equation (9c). This leads to the
following change in error functional resulting from model and data errors
ΔE = ΔEadj + ΔEfwd + ΔEopt .

(18)

From equation (10), the contribution to the error from the adjoint model is given by:
N

ΔEadj =
i=1

μTi · R−1

(19)

The contribution to the error brought by the forward model only depends on model errors:
tF

ΔEfwd =

ν T · Δb(t) dt .

(20)

The contribution to the error from the optimality equation can be computed from equation
(10) as follows:
ΔEopt = ζ T ·

Note that the quantity under the sum in (21) can be computed by a single backward integration
of the adjoint ODE model (9a) using a forcing term
N

Jx =

HTi R−1

The ﬁnal formula for ΔE can be obtained from (19), (20) and (21). The super-Lagrange
multipliers required to perform the computations are obtained via Algorithm 1.

We discretize the PDE (23) in space using a central diﬀerence scheme to obtain an ODE
of the form (4), which is our forward model. The evolution of temperature with time is shown
in the Figure 1(a). Synthetic observations are obtained by numerically integrating the forward
model, started from the reference initial condition. Random observation errors are added to
the values obtained by numerical integration. The observation errors are normally distributed
with 0 mean and 10% standard deviation. Synthetic model errors are introduced by adding
constants to the actual model; the imperfect model has the form (14) with Δb(t) = 1.
We solve the inverse problem (6) to obtain xa0 which minimizes the cost function (5). The
quantity of interest, i.e., the error functional, is the mean value of the optimal initial condition
E (xa0 ) =

(24)

The procedure outlined in Algorithm 1 and Section 3 is followed to estimate the impact of the
data and model errors on the mean of the optimal solution (24). Solutions of the tangent linear,
ﬁrst order adjoint, and the second order adjoint models are shown in Figures 1(b), 1(c), and
1(d) respectively.

Results and discussion

We denote by xa0 the initial conditions obtained by solving the inverse problem (6), and by xa0
the initial conditions obtained by solving the inverse problem (6). The actual error in the mean
solution (24) is given by:
ΔEactual = E (xa0 ) − E (xa0 ) =

((xa0 )i − (xa0 )i ) .

(25)

A posteriori estimates of this error ΔEest are calculated using the methodology discussed in
Section 3. Table 1 compares the actual and the estimated errors in the mean initial values. We
observe that the estimates are fairly accurate. Figure 2(a) shows the errors in the individual
observations; they are randomly distributed. Figure 2(b) shows the contributions of diﬀerent
observation errors to the error in the quantity of interest (24). We observe that certain grid
points contribute to the error more than others. Since the physical process is diﬀusive, measurements errors occurring earlier in time contribute more to the a posteriori error estimate.
The data error contributions indicate the sensitive areas, where measurements need to be very

accurate. Gross inconsistencies in the data error contribution may also point towards faulty
sensors. Figure 2(c) shows the contributions of model errors at diﬀerent grid points to the error
in the quantity of interest (24). We observe that the contributions of model errors follows the
proﬁle of the second order adjoint model evolution shown in Figure 1(d). This is in agreement
with the theory in Section 2. Some grid points tend to be more sensitive than the others to the
errors in the model. This indicates the need for better physical representation, e.g., obtained
by increasing grid resolution in the sensitive regions.

Conclusions

DDDAS inference problems are solved in practice using imperfect models and imperfect data.
The errors in the model and data impact the result of the inference. This work develops a
methodology to estimate the impact of model and data errors on the inference result. The a
posteriori error estimation is applied after solving the inverse problem. The approach considers
a scalar quantity of interest that depends on the inference result, and that is formalized as an
error functional. The errors in the quantity of interest due to errors in the model and data are
estimated to ﬁrst order using an algorithm that involves tangent linear, ﬁrst, and second order
adjoint models. While the presentation here uses linear ODE models the theoretical framework
can be extended to any inverse problem. We illustrate the proposed approach using a data
assimilation test for the one dimensional heat equation. For this example the error estimates

are very close to the actual errors in the quantity of interest due to both the data as well as
the model inaccuracies.
The proposed methodology can prove useful in a general DDDAS context to quantify and
reduce uncertainties in the system. The error estimates can be used to locate faulty observations.
Moreover, the areas of maximum sensitivity highlighted via the error estimates indicate the
locations where greater accuracy in measurements is required (adaptive observations), or where
it is beneﬁcial to increase the model resolution (adaptive modeling).
