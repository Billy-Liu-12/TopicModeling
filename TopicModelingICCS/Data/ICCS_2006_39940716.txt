Abstract. The CPM{P, N } methods form a class of methods specially
devised for the propagation of the solution of the one-dimensional Schr¨
odinger equation. Using these CPM{P, N } methods in a shooting procedure, eigenvalues of the boundary value problem are obtained to very
high precision. Some recent advances allowed the generalization of the
CPM{P, N } methods to systems of coupled Schr¨
odinger equations. Also
for these generalised CPM{P, N } methods a shooting procedure can be
formulated, solving the multichannel bound state problem.

Introduction

There are many problems in quantum chemistry, theoretical physics, atomic
and molecular physics, and physical chemistry that can be transformed into the
solution of coupled diﬀerential equations of Schr¨
odinger type. Such a system of
coupled equations may be written in matrix notation
d2 y(x)
= [V(x) − EI] y(x) .
dx2

(1)

If there are n channels, y(x) is a column vector of order n, I is the n × n unity
matrix. The potential energy n × n matrix V(x) will be assumed throughout the
following to be symmetric, which is often the case in molecular scattering and
bound state applications.
There are various approaches to the solution of the coupled equations (1) (see
a.o. [1, 2, 5, 14, 15]). In the more early work approximate schemes were used which
attempt to reduce the coupled equations to a set of one-dimensional problems
(e.g. in [14]). A more modern approach is to propagate the solutions numerically,
without reducing them to one-dimensional form. A large number of numerical
methods have been suggested for carrying out the propagation. However when
bound state boundary conditions are applied, acceptable solutions of the coupled
equations exist only when E is an eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian and additional
techniques are needed to locate the eigenvalues. Early methods for doing this
were developed by Gordon [4] and Johnson [10].

Piecewise Constant Perturbation Methods

Recently it has been shown in [12] that higher order Piecewise Constant Perturbation (CP) methods can be constructed for the propagation of the solution
of Eq. (1). Here we will show how such a CP method can be used in a shooting procedure to solve the associated eigenvalue problem, that is to estimate
the values of E for which a solution of Eq. (1) exists satisfying some boundary
conditions in the endpoints of the integration interval.

The CP Algorithm for the Multichannel Case

The Piecewise Perturbation methods (PPM) have been successfully applied for
the propagation of the solution of a one-dimensional Schr¨
odinger problem (see
[6, 7]). The PPM idea is to replace (piecewisely) the given equation by another
diﬀerential equation, called the reference diﬀerential equation, which can be
solved exactly. The deviation of the solution of the reference equation from the
solution of the original equation is further estimated by means of the perturbation theory.
The CP methods form a subclass of the PPM where the potential function V
of the reference equation is a piecewise constant. In [7] and [11] some higher order
CP versions, the so-called CPM{P, N } methods were found to be well suited for
the solution of the one-dimensional Schr¨
odinger problem. More recently these
CPM{P, N } formulae were generalised to the coupled channel case (see [12]). In
this section the main elements of the CPM{P, N } algorithm are recapitulated
brieﬂy. In the following description bold type indicates a column vector or matrix.
Let [X, X+h] be the current one step interval of the partition of the integration
interval. The multichannel Schr¨
odinger problem
y = (V(x) − EI) y

(2)

is considered on this interval. The algorithm of the CP method links the values
of the solution at the two ends of the interval in the following two ways, to be
used for forwards and backwards propagation,
y(X + h)
y(X)
= Tf (h)
,
y (X + h)
y (X)

y(X + h)
y(X)
= Tb (h)
.
y (X + h)
y (X)

To construct Tf and Tb we use two particular solutions of the local problem
y = (V(X + δ) − EI) y, δ ∈ [0, h] .

(3)

Speciﬁcally, if u(δ) and v(δ) are the n × n solutions corresponding to the initial
conditions y(0) = I, y (0) = 0 and y(0) = 0, y (0) = I, respectively (0 is the n
by n zero matrix) then Tf and Tb have the form
Tf (δ) =

u(δ) v(δ)
v (δ) −v(δ)
, Tb (δ) =
,
u (δ) v (δ)
−u (δ) u(δ)

To determine u and v the potential matrix is approximated by a truncated series
over the shifted Legendre polynomials Pn∗ (δ/h). The used parametrization is

The symmetric matrix V0 is then diagonalized and let D be the diagonalization
matrix. In the D representation Eq. (3) becomes

is the perturbation.
First, the matrices of functions uD (δ) and vD (δ), denoted generically as p(δ),
are written as a perturbation series:
p(δ) = p0 (δ) + p1 (δ) + p2 (δ) + p3 (δ) + . . .

(9)

where the zeroth order term p0 (δ) is the solution of
p0 = V0D − E p0

(10)

with p0 (0) = I, p0 (0) = 0 for u0 and p0 (0) = 0, p0 (0) = I for v0 . Let the
functions ξ(Z) and η0 (Z) be deﬁned as follows:
ξ(Z) =
and

cos(|Z|1/2 ) if Z ≤ 0 ,
cosh(Z 1/2 ) if Z > 0 ,

while ηs (Z) with s > 0 are further generated by recurrence :
η1 (Z) = [ξ(Z) − η0 (Z)]/Z,
ηs (Z) = [ηs−2 (Z) − (2s − 1)ηs−1 (Z)]/Z ,

s = 2, 3, . . . .

(13)

The zeroth order propagators u0 (δ) and u0 (δ) are then diagonal matrices, deﬁned
as follows:
(14)
u0 = v0 = ξ(Z)
δu0 = Z(δ)η0 (Z)

(15)

v0 = δη0 (Z)

Z(δ) = (VD 0 − EI)δ 2

where
and ξ(Z), ηm (Z) two n × n diagonal matrices of functions with ξ(Zi ), resp.
ηm (Zi ) as ith diagonal element (with Zi (δ) = (V0Dii − E)δ 2 ).
The n × n ’correction’ matrix of functions pq is the solution of the system
pq = (V0D − EI)pq + ΔV(δ)pq−1 , pq (0) = pq (0) = 0 .

(18)

The following iteration procedure exists to construct the corrections.
Correction pq−1 (p = uD , vD ) is assumed to be known and of such a form
that the product ΔV(δ)pq−1 reads

To calculate successive corrections for uD , the starting functions in ΔV(δ)p0 (δ)
are Q(δ) = ΔV and R0 (δ) = R1 (δ) = ... = 0. For vD the starting functions
are Q(δ) = 0, R0 (δ) = ΔV(δ), R1 (δ) = R2 (δ) = ... = 0. We have thus all
ingredients necessary to evaluate the perturbative corrections.
Once the values at h of the uD , vD matrices and of their derivatives have
been evaluated, they are reconverted to the original representation to obtain the
desired Tf and Tb .
This theory was used to construct some CP versions which are identiﬁed as
CPM{P, N } methods. Such a CPM{P, N } algorithm is of maximum order P
at low energies and of order N in the asymptotic regime. As shown in [12] a
CPM{P, N } method can be used to eﬃciently propagate the solution of Eq. (2)
(forwards and backwards).

The Boundary Value Problem

We now consider the eigenvalue problem arising when boundary conditions are
introduced at both ends of the integration interval. Values of E have to be found
for which a solution of (1) exists satisfying the boundary conditions.
Before proceeding to the multichannel case, it is instructive to consider the
procedure used for the single-channel (one-dimensional) Schr¨
odinger equation.
In the one-dimensional case y(x) and V (x) are both scalar quantities
y (x) = [V (x) − E]y(x), x ∈ (a ≥ −∞, b ≤ +∞) .

(22)

In this simple case, the eigenvalue problem has been solved since the early work
of Cooley [3] based on the widely used shooting method. Such a shooting method
proceeds as follows: A trial value Etrial of E is chosen and the following steps are
used: (i) we start at the beginpoint of the integration interval a and propagate
the solution (e.g. using a CP method) towards the endpoint of the integration
interval b. We stop at an arbitrary point xmatch . (ii) We then start at b and we
propagate backwards until xmatch is reached. (iii) At xmatch the left-hand and
right-hand solutions are matched. The two solutions are arbitrarily normalised,
so their values can always made to agree at the matching point by renormalising
them. However, the criterion for Etrial to be an eigenvalue is that the derivatives
y should match, as well as the values. The matching condition is thus
yL
y
= R ,
yL
yR

(23)

or equivalently
det

yL yR
yL yR

=0,

(24)

where the subscripts L and R indicate outwards and inwards solutions originating at a and b respectively. The matching function yL yR −yR yL is thus a function
of the energy that is zero when Etrial is an eigenvalue. If Etrial is not found to be
an eigenvalue, steps (i)-(iii) are repeated with an adjusted value of Etrial . It is

Piecewise Constant Perturbation Methods

721

possible to obtain a new Etrial value simply by using one of the standard numerical procedures for ﬁnding a zero of a function. For the CP methods a NewtonRaphson iteration procedure can be formulated, because the CP algorithm allows
a direct evaluation of the ﬁrst derivatives of the solution with respect to the energy E (see [7]). The software packages SLCPM12 [8] and Matslise [13] use the
CP methods in combination with this Newton-Raphson process to obtain very
accurate eigenvalue estimations for the one-dimensional Schr¨
odinger problem.
For a system of n coupled equations, a procedure can be used which is largely
inspired from the method outlined above for the one-dimensional problem. In
the multichannel case, the desired wavefunction is a column vector y(x). In order
to start propagating a solution to the coupled equations, it is necessary to know
not only the initial values of the elements of y(x) at a and b (which are given
by the boundary conditions) but also their derivatives. In the single-channel
case, the initial derivatives are arbitrary, because their eﬀects are cancelled by
renormalising the function after the matching point was reached. However, in the
multichannel case the situation is more complicated: here the ratios of the initial
derivatives in the diﬀerent channels are signiﬁcant. In early methods, schemes
were devised for converging upon suitable initial derivatives as well as the eigenvalue. However, Gordon [4] has devised a method that avoids the problem of
searching for the correct values of the initial boundary derivatives. Instead of
propagating a single wavefunction vector, a complete set of n vectors is propagated, spanning the space of all possible initial derivatives. So the wavefunction
becomes an n×n matrix Y(x) instead of a column vector y(x). Since the columns
of Y(x) span the space of all possible initial derivatives, any wavefunction that
satisﬁes the boundary conditions can be expressed as a linear combination of
them. The true wavefunction vector y(x) can thus be expressed as
y(x) = YL (x)cL , x ≤ xmatch ,
y(x) = YR (x)cR , x ≥ xmatch ,

(25)
(26)

where YL and YR are the wavefunction matrices propagated from a and b and cL
and cR are x-independent column vectors that must be found. For an acceptable
wavefunction, both y and its derivative must match at x = xmatch ,
y(xmatch ) = YL (xmatch )cL = YR (xmatch )cR ,
y (xmatch ) = YL (xmatch )cL = YR (xmatch )cR .

(27)
(28)

These two equations can be combined into the single equation
YL YR
YL YR

cL
=0,
−cR

(29)

where the matrix on the left-hand side is evaluated at x = xmatch . It is a matrix
of order 2n × 2n and is a function of the energy at which the wavefunctions are
calculated. A non-trivial solution of Eq. (29) exists only if the determinant of the
matrix on the left is zero, and this is only true if the energy used is an eigenvalue
of the coupled equations. It is then straightforward to ﬁnd the vectors cL and cR .

722

V. Ledoux, M. Van Daele, and G. Vanden Berghe

As for the one-dimensional case it is possible to construct a Newton-Raphson
process to localise the eigenvalues by using the derivatives of the wavefunction
with respect to E. As shown in [9] and [12] these derivatives can be propagated
by the CP methods simultaneously with the wavefunction itself at a relatively
low extra cost.
The procedure described above requires that the wavefunction matrix and its
derivative be propagated explicitly. However there is one well known diﬃculty
in the theory of close-coupled equations. The propagation of the wavefunction
into the so-called classically forbidden region (where V (x) > E) is numerically
unstable. It is due to the fact that the exponentially growing component yj of the
wave function in the most strongly closed (Vjj (x) > E) channel soon dominates
the entire wave function matrix and destroys the required linear independence
of the solutions. One approach to overcoming the diﬃculty is to apply certain
stabilizing transformations during propagation (see [4]). In [9] a stabilizing transformation based on LU decomposition is described for the propagation by CP
methods. After some propagation steps this regularization procedure can be applied to re-establish the linear independence of the columns.
Another way to avoid the diﬃculty is to use a so-called ”invariant imbedding”
method, in which the propagated quantity is not the wave function matrix Y(x)
but rather its logarithmic derivative Y (x)Y(x)−1 (see e.g. [10]). For the CP
methods we can use the knowledge of the components of the matrix Tf and Tb
for the propagation of the log derivative of the solution Ψ = Y Y−1 :
Ψ(X + h) = [u (h) + v (h)Ψ(X)][u(h) + v(h)Ψ(X)]−1
Ψ(X) = [−u (h) + u(h)Ψ(X + h)][v (h) − v(h)Ψ(X + h)]−1 .

(30)

The matching condition can then also be expressed in terms of Ψ(x).

Example

As a test problem, we consider a multichannel Schr¨odinger problem of which the
exact eigenvalues are known
y =

x2 − E −1
y,
−1 x2 − E

y(0) = y(10) = 0 .

(31)

The CPM{10,8} method was used as the propagation method and at xmatch a
Newton-Raphson process was applied. Doing all calculations in standard precision (16 signiﬁcant ﬁgures), the results listed in Table 1 were generated. The table
shows the ﬁrst four eigenvalue estimations for diﬀerent values of the input tolerance
tol. The second column contains the number of meshpoints m in the corresponding
partition. For more details on the generation of the partition, we refer to [12].
Knowing that the ﬁrst four exact eigenvalues are 2, 4, 6 and 8, it is clear that
we were able to obtain very precise eigenvalue approximations. Also other (more
complicated) testcases show that the multichannel CPM{P, N } methods have
the power to estimate eigenvalues accurately. Moreover, the CPM{P, N } methods are very eﬃcient to use in a shooting process: the relatively time consuming
