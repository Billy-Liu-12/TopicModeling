Abstract. A high-resolution semi-discrete central-upwind scheme for
solving a two class Lighthill-Whitham-Richards (LWR) traﬃc ﬂow model
is investigated in this paper. This scheme is based on combining a fourthorder central weighted essentially nonoscillatory (CWENO) reconstruction with semi-discrete central-upwind numerical ﬂux. The CWENO
re construction is chosen to improve the accuracy and guarantee the
non-oscillatory behavior of the present method. The strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta method is used for time integration. The resulting
method is applied to simulating several tests such as mixture of the
two traﬃc ﬂows. The simulated results illustrate the eﬀectiveness of the
present method.
Keywords: Traﬃc ﬂow model, central-upwind scheme, CWENO reconstruction.

Introduction

Continuum traﬃc ﬂow models are of great practical importance in many applications such as traﬃc simulation, traﬃc control, and, etc. The Lighthill-WhithamRichards (LWR) model proposed independently by Lighthill and Whitham [1]
and Richards [2] is the forerunner for all other continuum traﬃc ﬂow models. In
recent years an amount of research was done in implementing and extending the
LWR model. Zhang [3] and Jiang et al. [4] proposed higher-order continuum models. Wong and Wong [5] presented a multi-class LWR traﬃc ﬂow model(MCLWR
model). For numerical method, the Lax-Friedrichs scheme was used to solve the
MCLWR model in [5]. The Lax-Friedrichs scheme is only ﬁrst-order accurate
and yields a relatively poor resolution due to the excessive numerical dissipation. Recently, the Godunov scheme was also employed to solve the LWR model
[6] and higher-order model [7]. However, the Godunov scheme needs to use exact or approximate Riemann solvers, which make the scheme complicated and
time-consuming. Zhang, et al. [8] pointed out that the scalar LWR model and
those higher-order continuum models proposed so far contain hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations. One important feature of this type equation is that it

admits both smooth and discontinuous solutions such as shocks. However, the
lower order numerical methods may produce smeared solutions near discontinuities due to excessive numerical viscosity. The high-order scheme can provide the
satisfactory resolution. Moreover, the problems in which solutions contain rich
smooth region structures can be resolved by the high-order scheme on a relatively
small number of grid points. To embody traﬃc phenomena described by traﬃc
ﬂow model completely and resolve discontinuities well, a high-resolution shockcapturing numerical method is required. A recent application of the weighted
essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) scheme can be found in [8,9].
In this paper we study another type shock-capturing scheme, the so-called
high-resolution semi-discrete central-upwind schemes originally introduced in
[10], which have attracted considerable attention more recently. These schemes
enjoy the advantages of high-resolution central schemes. They are free of Riemann solvers, require no characteristic decompositions and retain high resolution
similar to the upwind results. At the same time, they have an upwind nature.
These features make the semi-discrete central-upwind schemes a universal, efﬁcient and robust tool for a wide variety of applications. With regard to its
application to traﬃc ﬂow problems, we have not yet seen any research works. In
this work the semi-discrete central-upwind scheme combined with fourth-order
central WENO (CWENO) reconstruction [11] is applied to a two class LWR
traﬃc ﬂow model.
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the two class LWR
traﬃc ﬂow model. In section 3 we describe our numerical method. Numerical
simulations are carried out in section 4. The conclusions are given in section 5.

The Tow-Class Model

The MCLWR model [5] describes the characteristics of traﬃc ﬂow of M classes of
road users with diﬀerent speed choice behaviors in response to the same density
when traveling on a highway section. There are some diﬃculties to compute the
eigenvalues and prove the hyperbolicity of the model for M > 3. In this paper,
we consider the two-class(M = 2) LWR traﬃc ﬂow model, which can be written
in conservation form as
(1)
ut + f(u)x = 0 ,
where u is the vector of conserved variables and f (u) is the vector of ﬂuxes.
These are given respectively by
u=

ρ1
ρ2

, f(u) =

ρ1 u1 (ρ)
ρ2 u2 (ρ)

,

where ρ1 and ρ2 are the densities for Class 1 and Class 2 traﬃc, respectively,
ρ = ρ1 + ρ2 is the total density, and u1 (ρ) and u2 (ρ) are the velocity-density
relationships. The two eigenvalues of the Jacobian are
√
λ1,2 = (u1 (ρ) + ρ1 u1 (ρ) + u2 (ρ) + ρ2 u2 (ρ) ± Δ)/2 ,
(2)

Numerical Solution of a Two-Class LWR Traﬃc Flow Model

where
Δ = ((u1 (ρ) + ρ1 u1 (ρ)) − (u2 (ρ) + ρ2 u2 (ρ)))2 + 4ρ1 ρ2 u1 (ρ)u2 (ρ) .

(3)

Since Δ ≥ 0 and λ1,2 are real, the model is hyperbolic.

Numerical Scheme

For simplicity, let us consider a uniform grid, xα = αΔx, tn = nΔt, where
Δx and Δt are the uniform spatial and time step, respectively. The cell average in the spatial cell Ij = [xj−1/2 , xj+1/2 ] at time t = tn is denoted by

n

unj (t) = Δx
Ij u(x, t ) dx. Starting with the given cell averages {uj } , a piecewise polynomial interpolant is reconstructed

˜ (x) =
u

(4)

j

Here χj is the characteristic function of the interval Ij and pnj (x) is a polynomial of a suitable degree. Diﬀerent semi-discrete central-upwind schemes will
be characteristic of diﬀerent reconstructions. Given such a reconstruction, the
˜ at the interface points {xj+1/2 } are denoted by u+

speeds, which can be estimated by

Here λ1 , · · · , λN denote the N eigenvalues of ∂f/∂u. The semi-discrete centralupwind scheme for the spatial discretization of equation (1) can be given by(see

Note that diﬀerent semi-discrete central-upwind schemes are typical of diﬀerent reconstructions. The accuracy of the semi-discrete scheme (6)-(7) depends

on the accuracy of the reconstruction (4). One can use the second order piecewise linear reconstruction, the third-order piecewise quadratic reconstruction,
highly accurate essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) reconstruction, highly accurate WENO reconstruction or highly accurate CWENO reconstruction. In this
work, we have used an fourth-order CWENO reconstruction proposed in [11] to
compute the point values u±
j+1/2 . To simplify notations, the superscript n will be
omitted below. In each cell Ij , the reconstruction, pj (x), is a convex combination
of three quadratic polynomials, ql (x), l = j − 1, j, j + 1,

Numerical Examples

In this section, we choose several numerical examples presented in [9] as out test
case. The results demonstrate the performance of the present method for the
two-class LWR traﬃc ﬂow model. In all examples, the following velocity-density
relationships are chose:
u1 (ρ) = u1f (1 − ρ/ρm ), u2 (ρ) = u2f (1 − ρ/ρm ) ,

(12)

where ρm is maximal density and u1f and u2f are the free ﬂow velocity for Class
1 and Class 2 traﬃc, respectively. Moreover, the variables of space, time, density

and velocity are scaled by L, T , ρm and uf , where L is the length of the road, T is
computational time and uf = max(u1f , u2f ). A variable is also non-dimensional
if it is not followed by its unit.
Example 1: Mixture of the two traﬃc ﬂows.
The computational parameters are L = 6000m, T = 400s, Δx = 60m, Δt =
0.4s, u1f = 14m/s and u2f = 20m/s. The initial data is taken as the following
Riemann problem:
(0, 0.4) ,
(0.4, 0) ,

u(x, 0) =

x < 0.1 ,
x > 0.1 .

(13)

In this test Class 2 traﬃc will mix in Class 1 traﬃc, which causes the increase of
total density. Its solution contains a shock, a constant region and a rarefaction.
The total density computed by the presented method is shown in Fig. 1. To
illustrate the advantage of using high-order schemes, the Godunov scheme with
the Rusanov approximate Riemann solver [13,14] is also adopted to compute
the same problem using the same parameters. Here and below, this scheme is
abbreviated to GR. The scheme presented in this paper is abbreviated to CP4.
The result computed by GR scheme is presented in Fig. 2. This comparison
demonstrates the clear advantage of SD4 scheme over GR scheme. The SD4
scheme has the higher shock resolution and smaller numerical dissipation.

Note that u2 = 16m/s > u1f and thus Class 1 drivers can not keep up with
Class 2 drivers. A vacuum region is formed between Class 1 and Class 2 traﬃc.
This test has solution consisting of a right shock, a constant region and a left
rarefaction. Figs. 3 and 4 show the results obtained with CP4 and GR scheme,
respectively. It can be seen that discontinuities are well resolved by CP4 scheme.
Example 3: A close following of the two traﬃc ﬂows.
The parameters are L = 4000m, T = 240s, Δx = 80m, Δt = 0.4s, u1f = 14m/s

u(x, 0) =

(0.2, 0) , x < 0.1 ,
(0, 0.44) , x > 0.1 .

The high resolution properties of CP4 scheme are illustrated in Fig. 5.

Conclusions

As an attempt to simulate traﬃc ﬂow by high-resolution ﬁnite diﬀerence schemes,
we have applied the semi-discrete central-upwind scheme to a two class LWR
traﬃc ﬂow model in this paper. The numerical results demonstrate that the semidiscrete central-upwind scheme resolve the shock and rarefaction waves well. This
universal, eﬃcient and high-resolution scheme will be implemented and applied
to higher-order continuum models and multi-class models to simulate traﬃc ﬂow
in our future work.
