Abstract. We report results of unsteady, harmonic flow simulations with the lattice
BGK method in two-dimensional elastic tubes. The tubes are assumed to obey a
simple constitutive equation, linearly relating the diameter of the tube to the pressure
difference inside and outside the tube. First, as a benchmark, we present results of
steady flow in such elastic tubes, and compare the performance of three different
boundary conditions for the solid wall. Next, we present results of unsteady
(harmonic) flow in the elastic tube, and validate the results by comparing them with
theoretical expressions for the dispersion relation of the complex speed of traveling
waves in the tube. Within the range of Womersley numbers tested the agreement
between the simulations and the theory is good.

1 Introduction
We have a strong interest in simulating unsteady flow in complex geometry using the
Lattice Boltzmann BGK method (LBGK, for an introduction we refer to [1]). In
particular, we focus on modeling blood flow in the large arteries of the human body. We
recently showed that LBGK is in principle capable of simulating such flows within the
range of Reynolds - and Womersley numbers that exist in the large arteries [2]. As a proof
of concept we applied LBGK to simulate flow in the lower abdominal aorta, including the
bifurcation to the left and right illiac arteries (supplying the legs with blood) [3,4].
In those simulations we assume that 1) blood is a Newtonian fluid and 2) that the
arteries are rigid structures. The first assumption is generally acknowledged to be valid in
the large arteries [5-7]. This is because of the relative high shear stress in those arteries
that renders a constant viscosity of 4 centipoise for whole blood. Despite this a number of
groups do investigate the influence of the true non-Newtonian nature of blood on the flow
profiles and shear stresses in the arteries [see e.g. 8,9]. As to the second assumption,
arteries as rigid structures, it is well known that, due to the pulsatile nature of blood flow
and the elasticity of the arteries and surrounding tissue, during a systolic cycle the

diameter of the larger arteries may vary 5-10 % (for a discussion, see e.g [10]). However,
in typical hemodynamic simulations the computational grid is obtained from Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) of real arteries. Such images obtained through MRI typically
have errors in the position of the artery lumen (i.e. the artery wall) of 1-8 % [11].
Therefore, given this accuracy, the influence of elasticity of the wall can be considered a
secondary effect. However, simulations do suggest that the movement of the wall may
have influence on the resulting flow fields, and more important in vascular disease, on the
resulting shear stress distributions on the wall [e.g. 7,12]. As we are currently working on
developing a virtual operating theatre for vascular reconstruction [13,14] the issue of wall
elasticity may be of importance. We therefore aim to relax this rigid wall assumption and
include elasticity of the arteries into our LBGK simulations.
In this paper we set the first steps towards including elastic walls into the LBGK
model. We will study the case of two-dimensional harmonic flow in a long and slender
elastic tube. This was previously done by Fang et al. [15]. They developed a tailored solid
boundary condition to be used for moving walls, and studied the case of steady flow and
of a harmonic flow. By comparing with theoretical expressions for steady flow they could
demonstrate the validity of their approach. For the harmonic flow they solely presented
simulation results. In this paper we extend the results of Fang et al. in two ways. First, we
compare the performance of three different boundary conditions in the case of a steady
flow in an elastic tube. Next, we perform unsteady harmonic flow simulations and
compare the results with theory, especially with a dispersion relation for the complex
speed of sound of the travelling waves in the tube.

2 Theory
The topic of unsteady flow in elastic tubes has a long history (see e.g. [5]), with a first
complete theoretical description for long and slender tubes being formulated by
Womersley [16]. Since then, this theory has been refined and extended in many respects
(for an overview, see e.g. [17]). However, we will use Womersley’s theory to validate our
simulations.
We assume a linear pressure-radius relationship:

R = R0 + β p 2 ,

(1)

p is the transmural pressure (i.e. the difference between the inside and outside pressure),
R0 the radius for zero transmural pressure and β a compliance constant. This relationship
is a good representation for the large arteries. [5]
First consider a steady flow driven by a pressure gradient. Because of the pressure drop
the radius at the high-pressure end will be larger than at the low-pressure end. We assume
that the tube is long and slender, that the flow is laminar and one-dimensional, and that
the entry – and exit effects are neglected. In that case the local flow field can be assumed
to be the well-known parabolic Poiseuille profile. Using this assumption in combination

with Eq. 1 and the fact that the flow rate Q in every cross section of the tube must be
constant, immediately leads to the following expression1: [5]

3νβQz = [R (0)]4 − [R( z )]4 ,

(2)

with ν the viscosity of the fluid and R(z) the radius of the tube at a distance z from the
inlet. By substituting the tube length L in Eq. 2 we get an expression for 3νβQz in terms
of the inlet – and outlet radius. Substituting that expression back into Eq. 2 yields an
explicit expression for R(z) in terms of the inlet – and outlet radius:

R( z ) =

([R( L)]

− [R (0)]4

.

(3 )

Finally, by substituting Eq. 3 into Eq. 1 we obtain an expression for the pressure in the
tube. Using the expression for the Reynolds number for Poiseuille flow we can now
immediately derive

Re =

[R(0)]4 − [R( L)]4
2 βLν 2

(4 )

The analytical solution for time dependent flow in an elastic tube was first described by
Womersley [16]. Here we just provide an outline of his theory. For all details we refer to
the original paper. The theory assumes that the non-linear terms in the Navier-Stokes
equations may be ignored (i.e. small Reynolds number flows). The tube is assumed to be a
thin-walled elastic tube with radius R, wall thickness h, density of the tube wall ρ.
Moreover, the density of the fluid is ρ0. The equations for the displacement of the wall
and the fluid motion are coupled through a set a boundary conditions at the inner wall of
the tube. Introducing a speed of sound c and looking at the type of motion in which u/c,
v/c, and ωR/c are small (with u and v the longitudinal – and radial components of the fluid
velocity, and ω the angular frequency of the driving harmonic pressure gradient), we can
write

p = p1 exp[iω (t − z / c)] ,

u = u1 exp[iω (t − z / c)] ,
v = v1 exp[iω (t − z / c)] .

(5.a)
(5.b)
(5.c)

Next, the equations of motion can be solved and in combination with the boundary
conditions four homogeneous linear equations in four unknowns are obtained. A non
trivial solution is only possible by requiring that the determinant of this system of
equations is zero, thus resulting in a dispersion relation which will determine the wave

flows here.

3 Results

3.1 Description of the Simulations

For the fluid flow simulations we apply the D2Q9 Lattice BGK model [1]. For the solid
walls we have tested three different boundary conditions. The Velocity Boundary
Condition (VBC) by Zou and He [18], the recently proposed boundary condition by
Bouzidi et al. [19] and another recently proposed boundary condition by Fang et al. [15].
The last one was specifically developed with moving boundaries in mind. At the inlet and
outlet we use pressure boundary conditions. For steady flows a constant pressure
difference is prescribed. For the unsteady flow the density at the inlet was set to 1 +
0.001×cos(2πt/T) and at the outlet to 1. Here, t denotes time and T the period of oscillation
(both measured in units of ∆t = 1).
As the solid walls move during the simulation, it may happen that fluid nodes turn into
boundary nodes and boundary nodes into solid nodes, or the other way around. If a
boundary node turns into a fluid node we need some prescription to assign values to the
yet unknown distribution function on the new fluid nodes. For this we use the method
described by Fang et al. [15], where the unknown distribution functions are assigned
through second order extrapolation in the directions that pointed towards fluid nodes in
the previous time step.

the walls are released. Left panel: steady flow on a 20 × 100 lattice (Re=1); right panel: harmonic
flow on a10 × 100 lattice with T=100.

The coupling between the fluid and the elastic wall is through Eq. [1]. We first start a
simulation with a fixed wall and allow the flow field to reach a steady state. Next, the wall
is released. In every cross section of the tube the pressure is measured, and the radius is
instantaneously adapted to the value given by Eq. [1]. Next, a LBGK iteration is
performed, the pressure is again measured, etc. This cycle is iterated until the tube has
settled (in case of steady flow) or performs steady harmonic oscillations (in case of the

1002 A.G. Hoekstra et al.

harmonic flow). Figure 1 shows an example of this settling of the tube wall for both
steady and period flows. For harmonic flow in tubes with a smaller inlet diameter the
convergence is faster (data not shown). The reason for not starting the simulation
immediately with elastic walls is that the stability of the simulations enhances
significantly if the flow is first allowed to settle in the uniform rigid tube (data not
shown).
3.2 Steady Flow

We have performed a set of simulations where the length of the tube was 600, the inlet
diameter was set to 30 and the outlet diameter to 21. The Renolds number was set to 1 and
10 respectively. First we show, in Fig. 2, the resulting diameter as a function of position in
the tube for the three boundary conditions. The theoretical curve (Eq. 3) is shown as well.
For other choices of diameters the results are comparable. We calculate an average error
defined by

definition as in Eq. 11), as a function of the grid spacing. The results are presented in Fig.

3. The error behavior is first order in the grid spacing (to be precise, for Re = 1 the error
goes as ∆x1.4 for all three boundary conditions, and for Re = 10 as ∆x1.4 for the Bouzidi
boundary condition and as ∆x1.1 for the other two).

3.3 Unsteady Flow

For the unsteady flow simulations we only applied the Fang boundary. In Fig. 4 we show
the propagating pressure wave that is induced in the elastic tube. Comparing the results of
the simulations to the dispersion relation in Eq. 6 is done by analyzing these pressure
waves. The only parameter that was changed for different simulations is the radius of the
tube under zero transmural pressure. With the radius, the Womersley number also
changes. This has an effect on the attenuation of the amplitude of the pressure wave
(through the function F, see Eq. 7.a). For large α the amplitude decreases less per
wavelength than for small α.
If we put the Poisson ratio and the thickness of the wall to zero in Eq. 6, which is the
case for our simulations, we find for the attenuation constant γ the following theoretical
values: at α=3.07 an attenuation constant of 0.102; if we then increase the radius by a
factor 2, which increases α to 6.14, we find an attenuation constant of 0.409. This means
the amplitude of the pressure wave drops faster along the length of the tube for lower
Womersley number. The attenuation constant γ is obtained from the simulations by fitting
the simulated pressure waves with the theoretical expressions. The results, for a range of
Womersley parameters, are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2.

For larger Womersley numbers the agreement between simulation and theory is
perfect. However, for the small α values we observe a large difference. This discrepancy
may be attributed to discretization errors. For instance, for α = 2.46 the radius of the inlet
was only 5 grid points. We performed another simulation for the same α but now with a
radius of 20 grid points (and a tube length of 3500 and T = 2500, thus dramatically
increasing execution times to 80 hours on a 300 MHz Sun workstation). After fitting we
now obtained γ = 0.031. This result is much closer to the theory, but still the error is
relatively large.
The influence from the compliance constant (i.e. the elasticity) of the wall on the
pressure waves comes only through c0, the wave velocity for a non-viscous fluid.2 In other
words, we expect that the attenuation is not influenced by the compliance constant. To
check this we ran a simulation for α = 6.14 with a twice as large compliance constant. In
that case we found γ = 0.43.
We have also measured the wavelength of the pressure waves λ = c0T/X.
Unfortunately, because of our specific simulation setup a theoretical expression for c0 was
not immediately obvious. Therefore, we have looked at ratios of measured wavelengths at

And of course also through the Poisson’s ratio, but here we have taken σ = 0.

4 Discussion
We presented a first set of results of LBGK simulations with elastic walls. From our
steady flow benchmarks we observe that the Fang boundary and Zou boundary have
comparable error behavior. Notice that in combination with moving walls the error in the
velocity is first order in the grid spacing. The Bouzidi boundary also is first order, but has
a much larger value of the errors. For non-moving walls this boundary condition is very
good (see e.g. 2). However, in combination with elastic walls our results suggest that the
details of the interpolations result wrong a density (and therefore pressure) field close to
the wall. This has an immediate effect on the location of the walls, see Eq. 1 and the
resulting velocity fields.
In the simulations for unsteady flow we have used the Fang boundary. For a rigid tube
we were able to perfectly reproduce Womersley flow with this boundary condition (data
not shown). For the elastic wall the results are very promising. We reproduce the
attenuated pressure waves as predicted by theory. Moreover, over a range of Womersley
numbers we have demonstrated a good agreement between the theoretical dispersion
relation for the complex wave velocity and our simulations. The relative large errors for
small Womersley number need further investigation, but the suggested discretization
effect may play an important role.
The elastic wall in our simulations was highly simplified: it was mass-less and had a
zero thickness. This is not very realistic, and as a next step we will consider tubes with a
thin wall and nonzero mass. This means that we will also have to integrate the equations
of motion of the wall. We will consider other constitutive equations for the wall, such as a
linear material described by a Young’s modulus and a Poisson ratio. In this case the c0 is
given by the Moens-Korteweg formula [5]. This will allow a more extensive validation of
our simulations, by comparison with Eq. 6 over a large range of parameter values.
Moreover, we will also extend the simulations to three dimensions, and consider more
realistic non-symmetrical cases.
