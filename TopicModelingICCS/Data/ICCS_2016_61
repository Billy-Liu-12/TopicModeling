Abstract
The aim of this paper is to further develop the original method proposed by the authors in their
previous publications and submitted as a patent to shape frequency response of a vibrating plate
according to precisely deﬁned demands. The method is based on modeling the plate together
with additional masses and ribs, and applying a sophisticated optimization algorithm, which
issues arrangement of the masses and ribs. It has a very high practical potential. It can be used
to improve acoustic radiation of the plate for required frequencies or enhance acoustic isolation
of noise barriers and device casings. It can be utilized for both passive and active control. For
the latter case it allows at the same time to optimally arrange actuators and sensors.
In the paper there are presented, compared and discussed simulation results of the method
for a plate with diﬀerent boundary conditions: simply supported, fully-clamped and elastically
restrained against rotation (corresponding to a mounting in a real device casing). Proposed
optimization criteria are followed from practical scenarios, where precise modiﬁcation of a vibrating plate frequency response is desired. The application of the proposed method for active
control is also shown. The important additional outcome of the paper are guidelines on designing device casings in terms of rigidity in order to obtain their required vibration and noise
isolation features.

Introduction

Vibration control of plates has been gaining high interest of researchers and practitioners. Such
plates can be used as structural sound sources resistant to harsh environmental conditions, or as
eﬃcient noise barriers. Depending on the given application, the method to appropriately locate
resonances and anti-resonances could substantially increase a radiated sound power [1, 2, 3, 4],

enhance passive attenuation of noise passing through, or improve active structural control ability
[5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
This paper follows previous publications of the authors [10, 11], oﬀering a complete original
method for shaping frequency response of a plate in strict accordance with the requirements,
which has also been submitted as a patent application [12]. In the literature there are no
reported methods of similar capabilities. In the proposed method the frequency shaping is obtained by simultaneous optimization of arrangement (shape and location) of additional masses
and ribs on the plate surface. For active control purposes, arrangement of actuators and sensors is included in the optimization process to improve controllability and observability of the
structure.
Computer simulation based on a physical model of the vibrating plate together with all those
components was discussed in details in [10]. The model was validated by means of computer
simulations and laboratory experiments, and it was compared with other models. In paper [11]
optimization of arrangement of the additional elements was performed for a number of cases,
proving all capabilities of the method. In that case a fully clamped plate was only considered.
The idea has been appreciated by many experts and practitioners in the ﬁeld of structural
noise and vibration control. In this paper, the aim is to further develop the idea, and present,
compare and discuss results of the method for a plate with diﬀerent boundary conditions:
simply supported, fully-clamped and elastically restrained against rotation (corresponding to a
mounting in a real device casing). Such analysis will let answer a question about its suitability
for control of machinery vibration and noise propagating through their casings of any kind.
Utilized cost functions are thus followed from practical scenarios, where precise modiﬁcation
of a vibrating plate frequency response is desired. Constraints for the optimization are related
mainly to the maximum dimensions and mass of the created structure, as well as types of
actuators and sensors if active control is concerned.
Due to complexity of the search space, a memetic algorithm is employed for solving the
optimization problem. It has proven its eﬃciency for optimizing locations of inertial actuators used to control thin light-weight plates [13]. The actuators’ masses have been taken into
account. It is the research that inspired the method applied for the present work. However,
this optimization problem is substantially more complex. Firstly, because of ribs, which are
included additionally in these considerations. Secondly, because of generally higher number of
elements considered, which substantially modify the plate response, and due to simultaneous
optimization of their shape along with location and orientation. Moreover, the optimization
problem becomes multi-objective when the frequency response is shaped along with ensuring
suﬃcient controllability and observability for the active control system.
This paper is divided into three main sections. Section 2 describes the optimized structure
itself. Section 3 is devoted to computer modeling method and optimization process. Section 4
presents the results for several practical scenarios. Finally, other areas of applications of the
proposed method are shown.

Vibrating structure

The vibrating structure considered in this paper is a steel plate deﬁned by following parameters:
a = 500 mm,
E = 200 GPa,

b = 500 mm,
ρp = 7850 kg/m3 ,

h = 1.5 mm,
ν = 0.3,

(1)

where a and b are the lengths of plate edges (in this paper a square plate is used as an example;
this does not limit validity of the method); E is the Young modulus; ν is the Poisson ratio; ρp
is the plate mass density; and h is the plate thickness. Plate edges are generally assumed to

be elastically restrained against rotation, with uniform rotational spring constants deﬁned as
in [10]:
(2)
krx0 = krx1 = kry0 = kry1 = kr .
However, there are three boundary conditions, representing diﬀerent kinds of applications,
distinguished in this paper: simply supported, denoted by S (kr = 0), fully-clamped, denoted
by C (kr = ∞) and elastically restrained against rotation, denoted by E (kr = 2). The
latter case corresponds to a mounting in a most common kind of real device casing, measured
experimentally in the authors’ laboratory. The frequency bandwidth is considered up to 350
Hz, and initial 12 eigenmodes of the plate are compared for each case. For unloaded plate,
natural frequencies are given in Tab. 1.
Weights of additional masses are limited to the maximum value of 0.2 kg. The concentrated
masses are assumed to be placed directly at the place surface. The ribs are assumed to have a
constant cross-section of a square shape with dimensions 0.006 m × 0.006 m. All the parameters
meet criteria of acceptance in practical applications.

Shaping frequency response method

The shaping frequency method uses a mathematical model based on the Mindlin plate theory,
and it includes impact of additional masses and ribs bonded to the plate surface. Detailed
derivation of the model is given in [10].
Next step of the method is deﬁnition of a cost function, which reﬂects desired modiﬁcation
of plate frequency response. A representative set of exemplary cost functions is given and
discussed in [11], and used there for a fully-clamped plate. In this paper, selected cost functions
are used to present an impact of boundary conditions, i.e., diﬀerent kinds of applications, on
results of the method. In the general form the cost function J can be presented as [11]:
J = f (ωi , λc,i , λo,i , Θ) ,

(3)

where ωi represents natural frequencies describing the frequency response, and i stands for the
eigenmode number; λc,i and λo,i are measures of controllability and observability of the system
expressed in the form of diagonal elements of the controllability and observability Gramian
matrices, respectively; Θ is a vector representing parameters of the elements to be mounted to
the plate, including their shapes and locations.
When the cost function is deﬁned, an optimization algorithm can be employed to ﬁnd appropriate arrangement of the additional elements. The search space followed from the frequency
response shaping problem deﬁned above is very complicated. An eﬃcient algorithm should be
chosen to ﬁnd a solution satisfying deﬁned demands. Evolutionary algorithms have proven to be
an eﬀective and versatile method for solving nonlinear optimization problems with multiple optima [14]. However, they typically require evaluation of numerous solutions, what results in high
computational eﬀort. In this research, a memetic algorithm is employed, which is a hybrid form
of population-based approach coupled with separate individual learning. Memetic algorithms

combine advantages of a global search, like for evolutionary algorithms, and local reﬁnement
procedures, which enhance convergence to the local optima [15]. Because of complementary
properties, they are particularly useful in solving complex multi-parameter optimization problems, such as placement of actuators on a vibrating plate [16], or selection of valuable training
data for Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [17]. The memetic algorithm ﬂowchart is presented
in Fig. 1. The conﬁguration of the memetic algorithm is described in details in [11]. More
information about the algorithm itself can be found, e.g. in [15].

Optimization results

In this Section, three exemplary optimization scenarios are presented and discussed, i.e. (i) maximization of the fundamental frequency, (ii) setting natural frequencies away from the given
value, and (iii) setting natural frequencies near the given value for active control. Each of them
is validated for a set of three diﬀerent boundary conditions.
In presented frequency responses, the solid line corresponds to the plate with additional
elements, and the dashed line represents the unloaded plate. In visualization of additional
elements, circles and lines represent placements of additional masses and ribs, respectively.
And in the ﬁnal scenario where active control is considered, circles with an ”X” inside and
diamonds represent actuators and sensors, respectively.

4.1

Maximization of the fundamental frequency

In this Subsection maximization of the fundamental frequency is considered. Such goal implies
the following cost function [11]:
J = −ω1 .

(4)

Only passive elements are considered—arrangement of one additional mass and one rib is optimized. Results of the optimization are given in Tab. 2 and Figs. 2-4.
It follows from the optimization that the rib has been placed in accordance with intuition,
i.e. it splits the plate into two equal parts. However, it turns out that the exact arrangement
depends strongly on the boundary conditions. For simply supported and elastically restrained
plates the optimal solution is to locate the rib on the diagonal of the plate. On the other hand,
in case of fully-clamped plate, the best result is achieved when the rib is placed parallel to
a plate edge. Moreover, the additional mass is placed as the outcome of the algorithm at a
plate edge and with minimal value, indicating that its presence is not justiﬁed. An important
conclusion from this analysis is also that if control of low frequencies is concerned, the plates,
also as walls of an entire casing, should be made as much clamped as possible, and their frames
should preferably be rigid.

Setting natural frequencies away from the given value

In this Subsection, the goal is to keep natural frequencies as far as possible from the given
frequency. For instance, it corresponds to a practical application, where the frequency of the
disturbance is known and the aim is to avoid excitation of natural frequencies of the plate (or
generalizing—a casing), thereby increasing its passive isolation. Assuming that such frequency
is ωd = 190 Hz and the mode closest to this given frequency ωd is the i-th mode, the cost
function is expressed as [11]:
J = − |ωi − ωd | ,

i ∈ {1, 2, ...} .

(5)

Only passive elements are considered—arrangement of one additional mass and one rib is optimized. Results of the optimization are given in Tab. 3 and Figs. 5-7.
In this scenario, the intuitive solutions are no longer available. However, the optimization
algorithm managed to ﬁnd eﬃcient arrangement for all boundary conditions, achieving values

of the cost function always below -30. It means that the disturbance frequency ωd can ﬂuctuate
in the range of approximately 15% around its nominal value, without a risk of approaching the
natural frequencies. It follows from the analysis that for this particular purpose of generating
a valley in the response, technical solutions closer to simply supported mounting exhibit superiority over clamped solutions. Thus, extending the analysis to full casings, they should be
frameless or made of light frames.

4.3

Setting natural frequencies near the given value for active control

In this subsection, an active control scenario is considered. Among the additional masses and
ribs, actuators and sensors need to be arranged. Hence, the cost function should express not
only the frequency response of the plate, but also controllability and observability measures.
Therefore, the optimization process becomes a multi-objective problem, because control-related
goals are not necessarily in line with requirements imposed on the frequency response of the
plate. Masses of actuators and sensors are assumed constant, equal 0.115 kg and 0.010 kg,
respectively.
In the considered case, the goal is to keep one of the natural frequencies as close as possible
to the given value ωsp = 220 Hz. Moreover, it is required that this mode should be controllable
and observable well. It corresponds to a situation, where an eﬃcient structural sound source of
particular frequency is tried to be achieved. The number of additional masses, ribs, actuators
and sensors was set to 1, 1, 2, 2, respectively.
The cost function is expressed as:

The given objective is achieved in all cases—natural frequencies are concentrated near the
frequency of 220 Hz, and controllability and observability of these modes are ensured. However,
it is worth noting that diﬀerent modes are moved depending on boundary conditions—modes 79 for the simply supported and elastically restrained plates, and modes 5-7 for the fully-clamped
plate. It is worth mentioning here that even if the problem of active control for a full device
casing is concerned, which requires quite sophisticated multichannel structure, it is nowadays
manageable, because there are numerically stable, eﬃcient and fast adaptive signal processing
algorithms [18, 19].

Conclusions

This paper further develops and summarizes the proposed method for shaping the frequency
response of a vibrating plate according to precisely deﬁned demands for diﬀerent boundary
conditions—simply supported, fully-clamped and elastically restrained against rotation. The
latter kind is particularly important, because it represents the largest sort of casings used
for industrial devices and home appliances. It has been shown that the proposed method of
frequency response shaping has a high potential to be successfully utilized for both passive and
active structural control applications. The limits are mainly related to the physical constraints
imposed on the structure—dimensions, overall weight and selected type of elements.
It follows from the paper that the optimal arrangement obtained for diﬀerent boundary
conditions varies even if the optimization has been performed with the same cost functions.
However, what is very important, the given objectives is always achieved. Depending of the
initial frequency response of the plate, diﬀerent modes are moved to fulﬁll the requirements.
The analysis also gives clear guidelines on how to technically design the active casing in
order to achieve its desired properties. The proposed method can be applied for panels of
any shape, and any structures, provided an appropriate model is built. If physical modeling
becomes too complicated for complex structures, numerical modeling, like FEM/BEM can be
used.
