Abstract. Financial risks refer to risks associated with financing, such as credit
risk, business risk, debt risk and insurance risk, and these risks may put firms in
distress. Early detection of financial risks can help credit grantors to reduce risk
and losses, establish appropriate policies for different credit products and increase revenue. As the size of financial databases increases, large-scale data
mining techniques that can process and analyze massive amounts of electronic
data in a timely manner become a key component of many financial risk detection strategies and continue to be a subject of active research. However, the
knowledge gap between the results data mining methods can provide and actions can be taken based on them remains large in financial risk detection. The
goal of this research is to bring the concept of chance discovery into financial
risk detection to build the knowledge-rich data mining process and therefore increase the usefulness of data mining results in financial risk detection. Using six
financial risk related datasets, this research illustrates that the combination of
data mining techniques and chance discovery can provide knowledge-rich data
mining results to decision makers; promote the awareness of previously unnoticed chances; and increase the actionability of data mining results.
Keywords: knowledge-rich data mining, chance discovery, financial risk detection, classification, risk analysis.

1 Introduction
Financial risks refer to risks associated with financing, such as credit risk, business
risk, debt risk and insurance risk, and these risks may put firms in distress. Take
health insurance risk as an example. According to the National Health Care AntiFraud Association’s (NHCAA) estimation, at least 3% of the United States’ annual
health care expenditure, which in calendar-year 2003 alone amounted to $1.7 trillion,
is lost to outright fraud or erroneous payment [20]. Another example is credit card
debt risk. The total credit card debt at the end of the first quarter of 2002 in the U.S. is
about $660 billion [21] and the total credit card holders declared bankruptcy in 2003
are more than 1.6 million [14].

Knowledge-Rich Data Mining in Financial Risk Detection

535

As the size of financial databases increases, large-scale data mining techniques that
can process and analyze massive amounts of electronic data in a timely manner become a key component of many financial risk detection strategies and continue to be a
subject of active research [4, 11, 16, 17]. While most data mining research focus on
developing algorithms or applying data mining methods to detect financial risk, how
to better utilize data mining results to help decision makers identify financial risks and
integrate data mining results into decision-making routines have not been widely
studied in the data mining community. The lack of interaction between industry practitioners and academic researchers makes it hard to discover financial risks or opportunities in data mining projects and hence weaken the value that data mining methods
may bring to financial risk detection. The knowledge gap between the results data
mining methods can provide and taking actions based on them [26] remains large in
financial risk detection.
The goal of this paper is to bring the concept of chance discovery into financial
risk detection to build the knowledge-rich data mining process and therefore increase
the usefulness and actionability of data mining results in financial risk detection. The
rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the datasets
employed for this study; discusses the data mining techniques used in financial risk
detection; and proposes a knowledge-rich data mining process for financial risk detection. Section 3 presents an empirical study that examines the proposed process using
six financial risk datasets and Section 4 summarizes the paper.

2 Financial Risk Detection Problem
There is no one universally accepted definition for financial risk. Any risk that relates
to financing can be considered as financial risk. According to its sources, financial
risk can be broadly categorized as investment risk, credit risk, and business risk [24].
Investment risk is the probability that an investment may produce an undesirable
outcome. Credit risk is the probability that debtors will not pay their debts. Business
risk denotes the possibility that income is less than expected and/or expenditure is
larger than expected. The datasets used in this work are examples of credit and business risk: consumer credit card application and existing credit cardholders’ behavior
belong to credit related risk; corporation bankruptcy and disability income insurance
datasets are business related risks. Financial risk detection is the practice of identifying or predicting these financial risks in an attempt to control risk and minimize
losses. The following subsections describe the data sources and examine the major
data mining techniques that have been applied in this work.
2.1 Financial Risk Datasets
The datasets used in this study come from five countries and represent four aspects of
financial risk: credit approval (credit card application and loan approval), credit behavior, bankruptcy risk, and fraud risk.
German credit card application dataset [22]
The German credit card application dataset comes from UCI Machine Learning
databases. It contains 1000 instances with 24 predictor variables and 1 class variable.

536

Y. Peng, G. Kou, and Y. Shi

The 24 variables describe the status of existing checking account, credit history, education level, employment status, personal status, age, and so on. The class variable
indicates whether an application is Accepted or Declined. 70% of the instances are
accepted applications and 30% are declined instances.
Australian credit card application dataset [19]
This dataset was provided by a large bank and concerns consumer credit card applications. It has 690 instances with 15 predicator variables plus 1 class variable. The class
variable indicates whether an application is Accepted or Declined. 55.5% of the instances are accepted applications and 44.5% are declined instances.
Credit cardholders’ behavior dataset [1, 11, 16]
The dataset was from a major US bank and contains 6000 credit card data with 64
predictor variables plus 1 class variable. Each instance has a class label indicating its
credit status: either Good or Bad. 84% of the data are Good accounts and 16% are
Bad accounts. Good indicates good status accounts and Bad indicates accounts with
late payments, delinquency, or bankruptcy. The predictor variables describe account
balance, purchase, payment, cash advance, interest charges, date of last payment,
times of cash advance, and account open date.
Japanese bankruptcy dataset [12]
This set collects 37 bankrupt Japanese firms and 111 non-bankrupt Japanese firms
from various sources during the post-deregulation period of 1989 to 1999. Final sample firms are ones traded in the First Section of Tokyo Stock Exchange, and their
financial data are available from 2000 PACAP database for Japan compiled by the
Pacific-Basin Capital Market (PACAP) Research Center at the University of Rhode
Island. Each case has 13 predictor variables and 1 class variable (Bankrupt or Nonbankrupt). The predictor variables describe financial state and performance of firms.
Korean bankruptcy dataset [13]
This dataset collects bankrupt firms in Korea from 1997 to 2003 from public sources.
It consists of 65 bankrupt and 130 non-bankrupt firms whose data are available and
publicly trading firms in the Korean Stock Exchange. Each case has 13 predictor
variables with one class variable (Bankrupt or Non-bankrupt).
Disability income insurance dataset [17]
Disability insurance provides financial support when a disability leaves the policyholder unable to work. The data was provided by an anonymous U.S. corporation.
Each instance concerns a disability income insurance claim. The set has 18,875 instances with 103 variables. A binary class attribute indicates whether an instance is a
Normal claim or Abnormal claim. There are 353 abnormal claims and 18,522 normal
claims. The abnormal instances represent fraudulent or erroneous claims and were
manually collected and verified.
2.2 Data Mining Techniques
Current data mining research in financial risk detection concentrates on fraud detection and credit risk analysis. Major data mining functions used in these areas include
classification, prediction, cluster analysis and outlier analysis. The selection of data
mining functions depends on data mining tasks. Since the datasets employed in this

Knowledge-Rich Data Mining in Financial Risk Detection

study are examples of classification applications, the data mining function used in this
paper is classification. Eight classification methods: Bayesian network [23], naïve
Bayes [8], Support Vector Machine (SVM) [18], linear logistic regression [3],
K-nearest-neighbor [7], C4.5 [19], Repeated Incremental Pruning to Produce Error
Reduction (RIPPER) rule induction [6] and radial basis function (RBF) network [2],
are used in our empirical study and all of them are implemented in WEKA [25].
Bayesian network and naïve Bayes classifier both model probabilistic relationships
between predictor variables and the class variable. While naïve Bayes classifier estimates the class-conditional probability based on Bayes theorem and can only represent simple distributions, Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphic model and can
represent conditional independencies between variables. SVM classifier uses a
nonlinear mapping to transform the training data into a higher dimension and search
for the linear optimal separating hyperplane, which is then used to separate data from
different classes [10]. Linear logistic regression models the probability of occurrence
of an event as a linear function of a set of predictor variables. K-nearest-neighbor
classifies a given data instance based on learning by analogy, that is, assigns it to the
closest training examples in the feature space. C4.5 is a decision tree algorithm that
constructs decision trees in a top-down recursive divide-and-conquer manner.
RIPPER is a sequential covering algorithm that extracts classification rules directly
from the training data without generating a decision tree first [10]. RBF network is an
artificial neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. In
addition to the eight classification techniques, we also employ ensemble method,
which aggregates the predictions of the above mentioned eight classifiers.
2.3 Knowledge-Rich Data Mining in Financial Risk Detection
Even though data mining has become a crucial tool in financial risk detection, most
data mining research focus on developing learning algorithms or improving existing
algorithms that can identify suspicious patterns or predict future behaviors efficiently
from financial databases and have not paid enough attention to the involvement of end
users and the actionability of the final data mining results. This is mainly due to two
reasons: (1) the difficulty in accessing real-life financial risk data; (2) limited access
to domain experts and background information. The lack of interaction between industry practitioners and academic researchers makes it hard to discover financial risks
or opportunities in data mining projects and hence weaken the value that data mining
methods may bring to financial risk detection.
In an attempt to improve the usefulness of data mining results and increase the
probability of identifying unusual chances in financial risk analysis, this paper proposes
a chance discovery and data mining process for financial risk detection (Figure 1).
Chance discovery (CD) is defined as “the awareness of a chance and the explanation of
its significance” [15]. Ohsawa and Fukuda [15] suggested three keys to chance discovery: communicating the significance of an event; enhancing user’s awareness of
an event’s utility using mental imagery; revealing the causalities of rare events using
data mining methods. Users, communication and data mining are the main parts of
chance discovery. Figure 1 combines the KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Database)
process model [9], the chance discovery process [15] and the CRISP-DM process
model [5]. It emphasizes three keys to chance discovery and knowledge-rich data

538

mining: users, communication and data mining techniques. Users refer to domain
experts and decision makers. Domain experts are knowledgeable of the field information, data collection procedures and meaning of variables. With the assistance of data
miners, domain experts can gain insights of financial risk data from different aspects
and potentially observe new chances. To turn the identified knowledge into financial
or strategic advantages, decision makers, who understand the operational and strategic
goals of a company, are required to provide feedbacks on the importance of the potential new chances and determine what actions should be taken. Moving back and forth
between steps is always required. The cyclical nature of chance discovery is illustrated by the outer circle of the chance discovery process in Figure 1.

3 Empirical Study
In this section we apply the proposed process in Section 2 to the six financial risk
datasets. The datasets were collected from five countries and represent four aspects of
financial risk: credit approval, credit behavior, bankruptcy risk, and insurance fraud.
The experiment was carried out according to the following process:
Chance discovery process for financial risk detection
Input: a financial risk related dataset
Output: Decision function; Results of performance metrics; new chance(s)
Step 1. Understand business requirements, dataset structure and data mining task

Step 2. Prepare target datasets: select and transform relevant features; data cleaning; data integration. Communicate any findings during data preparation to domain
experts.
Step 3. Train and test multiple data mining models in randomly sampled partitions
(e.g. k-fold cross-validation) using WEKA 3.5.7 [25].
Step 4. Evaluate data mining models using a set of performance metrics. The best
model/s is the decision function.
Step 5. Discuss the data mining results with domain experts. Explore potential
chance(s) from data mining results. If identify new chance(s), communicate the
chance(s) with decision makers and determine the appropriate actions. Go back to
Step 1 if new business questions are raised during the process.
END
Because different performance metrics are appropriate in different settings, this paper
utilizes six performance metrics: True Positive rate, True Negative rate, False Positive
rate, False Negative rate, Overall Accuracy and Area Under ROC. TP (True Positive)
is the number of correctly classified Abnormal (Bankrupt, Bad, or Declined) instances. FP (False Positive) is the number of Normal (Non-bankrupt, Good, or Accepted) instances that is misclassified as Abnormal class. TN (True Negative) is the
number of correctly classified Normal instances. FN (False Negative) is the number
of Abnormal instances that is misclassified as Normal class. Accuracy is one the most
widely used classification performance metrics. It is the ratio of correctly predicted
instances to the entire instances or instances in a particular class.
Overall Accuracy =

TN + TP
TP + FP + FN + TN

True Positive rate =

TP ,True Negative rate =
TN
TP + FN
TN + FP

False Positive rate =

FP , False Negative rate =
FN
FP + TN
FN + TP

ROC curves stands for Receiver Operating Characteristic which detects and characterizes the tradeoff between TP rate and FP rate. The area under the curve represents the probability of the ranking by the classifier of a randomly sampled positive
instance over a randomly sampled negative one. It indicates a classifier’s performance; the larger the area, the better the classifier.
The classification results of eight data mining methods plus ensemble method for
the six datasets are summarized in Table 1. In the dataset column, Australian indicates
Australian credit card application data; Chase indicates credit cardholders’ behavior
data; DI indicates the disability income insurance data; German indicates German
credit card application data; Japan indicates Japanese bankruptcy data and Korea
indicates Korean bankruptcy data. The nine classification methods described in
Section 2 were applied to each dataset using 10-fold cross-validation.

Knowledge-Rich Data Mining in Financial Risk Detection

541

To summarize, the empirical study demonstrated that introducing chance discovery
into the KDD process can promote the awareness of previously unnoticed chances
and increase the usefulness of data mining results.

4 Conclusion Remarks
In financial risk detection, fail to recognize significant chances may cause credit grantors and companies serious financial losses. In order to capture significant chances in
financial risk detection, this paper proposed a knowledge-rich data mining process
model and tested the model using real-life financial risk related datasets. The empirical study indicated that the combination of data mining techniques and chance
discovery can provide human inspectors more information than data mining alone;
promotes the awareness of identified financial risks among decision makers; and
increases the usefulness of data mining results in the decision-making process. Due to
the space limitation, this paper only reported the application of the knowledge-rich
data mining process model to fraud detection in insurance data. In the future, we will
continue the study about the usability of the process in other areas of financial risk
detection, such as bankruptcy prediction and credit cardholders’ behavior analysis.
