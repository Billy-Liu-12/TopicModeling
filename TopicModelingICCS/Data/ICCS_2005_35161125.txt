Introduction

For detection and diagnosis of changepoint statistical analysis method has been
successfully applied to a variety of networked and distributed systems. The rapid
growth of networked and distributed systems throughout the workplace has given
rise to the problems diﬃcult to manage with the expertise of human operators
in modern information technology ﬁeld. There is an urgent need for automating
the management functions to reduce the operation and management cost. Early
detection of performance degradation can alleviate the last moment hassel of
network mangers.
A sudden jump in the behavior of a system is a changepoint which can be estimated from the input data using the maximum likelihood estimator [2]. We need
a formulation of changepoint for detecting even a slight change. In this paper the
main goal is fast detection that is an important requirement for reducing potential negative impact on the network services and users. The detection problem
is formulated as a changepoint problem using Bayes factor. The computation of
the Bayes factor, however, gets more complex as the number of nodes increases.

To overcome the computational diﬃculties, we explore the binary segmentation method proposed in [3]. Our approach for detecting changepoint is mainly
developing formulas by Bayesian viewpoint. The proposed detection method is
designed to be sensitive to slight changes in the operation characteristics of a
network, and predict the changepoint at the change point of the shape parameter values. Computer simulation veriﬁes the eﬀectiveness and correctness of the
proposed approach.

Preliminaries

In the non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), the interarrival time is neither
independent nor identically distributed. A random variable of special interest is
N (t), the number of failures in the time interval (0, t]. The intensity function of
a counting process {N (t), t ≥ 0} is deﬁned as λ(t) = m (t), where m(t) is the
mean number of failures in the time interval (0, t], often called the mean value
function. The power law process for the reliability growth of repairable systems
has the intensity function,
λ(t) = αβtβ−1 , α > 0, β > 0, t > 0,

(1)

where α is a scale parameter and β is a shape parameter [1].
The likelihood function for the data D(0,T ] with the model of λ(·) given in
(1) can be written as
n

T

λ(ti ) exp −

L(α, β|D(0,T ] ) =
i=1

λ(t)dt ,

(2)

0

where D(0,T ] = {t1 , · · · , tn+1 |0 < t1 ≤ · · · ≤ tn < T, T = tn+1 }. See [3].
For the data D(0,T ] of failure times, the intensity functions are given respectively by
M0 : λ(t) = α0 β0 tβ0 −1 , 0 < t ≤ T, vs. M1 : λ(t) =

α1 β1 tβ1 −1 , 0 < t < τ ,
α1 β2 tβ2 −1 , τ ≤ t < T,

where τ is a changepoint.

The Proposed Changepoint Detection Method

We use the Bayes factor for comparing and testing the no-changepoint model
and single changepoint model. The test is based on calculating the Bayes factor
B10 for the single changepoint model M1 against the no-changepoint model M0 .
The detection procedure of the changepoint consists of the following steps:
Step 1: For the complete data, compute the Bayes factor B10 .
Step 2: When B10 > 1, estimate a changepoint τˆ for the given data.

Step 3: After a changepoint, as new data are sequentially added, compute the
Bayes factor B10 .
Step 4: When B10 > 1, estimate a new changepoint τˆ for the given data.
The Bayes factor B10 for the changepoint model against the no-changepoint
model is
B10 (D(0,T ] ) = B1 /B0 ,

Simulation Results

Each simulation dataset consists of two parts for diﬀerent shape parameter values of the intensity function of the power law process. We expect to detect a
changepoint around the point where the shape parameter value changes. The
hyperparameters for the prior of the shape parameter are ﬁxed as (ξ, ν) = (1, 1).

Case 1. We ﬁx the scale parameter as α = 0.5. The datasets are generated with
β = 1.0 and β = 0.6, respectively. Each dataset size is 20. Since the maximum
likelihood estimates of (α, β) are (0.471, 0.951) and (0.507, 0.624) respectively, it
seems that the data are fairly well generated. The time interval of the entire data
is (0, 48.185]. We detect a changepoint using Bayes factor. For the complete data
in (0, 48.185], the Bayes factor is 1.902 by (3) and the estimated changepoint is
12.218 by (4), where it is located between the 23th and 24th observation. We
want to build a detection system for sequential data. Thus we assume to detect
a change at the 25th observation. From the ﬁrst to the 25th observation, Bayes
factor is 4.620, and a changepoint is 11.986 in (0, 15.734]. Note that the position
of the changepoint estimated with only the 25 incomplete observations is still
same as that with the complete data. This demonstrates that the proposed
approach can promptly and correctly detect the change.
Case 2. Scale parameter α = 1.0, shape parameter β = 0.6 and 2.0, complete
data size: 50, MLEs of (α, β): (1.160, 0.616), (1.103, 1.887), time interval of complete data: (0, 161.471], Bayes factor: 1.591×1021 , changepoint: 156.633 (between
the 24th and 25th observation), change detection: 30th observation, B10 and τˆ
with the ﬁrst to the 30th observation: 10.683 and 152.863 (between the 24th and
25th observation).

Conclusion

In this paper we have proposed a Bayesian approach for detecting changepoint
with the power law process of the NHPP. As new data added sequentially, we
immediately detect changepoint as soon as Bayes factor becomes greater than 1.

Computer simulation veriﬁed the eﬀectiveness and correctness of the proposed
approach. This procedure of changepoint detection is applicable when the complete data is unavailable.
