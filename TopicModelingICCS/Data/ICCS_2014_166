Abstract
Cacha¸ca is a type of distilled drink from sugarcane with great economic importance. Its classiﬁcation includes three types: aged, premium and extra premium. These three classiﬁcations are
related to the aging time of the drink in wooden casks. Besides the aging time, it is important
to know what the wood used in the barrel storage in order the properties of each drink are
properly informed consumer. This paper shows a method for automatic recognition of the type
of wood and the aging time using information from a computer vision system and chemical
information. Two algorithms for pattern recognition are used: artiﬁcial neural networks and
k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor). In the case study, 144 cacha¸ca samples were used. The results
showed 97% accuracy for the problem of the aging time classiﬁcation and 100% for the problem
of woods classiﬁcation.
Keywords: pattern recognition, drink analysis, computer vision

Introduction

Cacha¸ca is the distilled drink most consumed among alcoholic beverages in Brazil. It is a special
type of beverage produced from sugarcane (Saccharum sp) similar to rum. Its diﬀerential is the
use of diﬀerent types of wood in the aging process.
Aging consists of storing the cacha¸ca in barrels or wooden casks for a certain time. This
process produces changes in the chemical composition, aroma, ﬂavor and color of the drink
[2]. The legislation classiﬁes the cacha¸ca into three types: aged cacha¸ca, premium cacha¸ca and

extra premium cacha¸ca. The diﬀerence among types is related to the quantity of storage and
shelf life. A aged and premium cacha¸ca have aging period of at least 1 year. Aged cacha¸ca
may have up to 50% of non-aged cacha¸ca using blend process. The premium chaca¸ca has 100%
aged cacha¸ca. The extra premium cacha¸ca has a minimum aging period of at least 3 years and
cannot contain non-aged cacha¸ca.
As the most famous drinks in the world, whiskeys, brandies and even wines go for oak barrels. Cacha¸ca is the only one that uses diﬀerent woods for this process[2][8]. Each wood gives
the drink a sensory analysis involving the measurement, interpretation and understanding of
human responses to the properties perceived by the senses (taste - ﬂavor, smell - aroma, vision color). However, some woods only fortify the acidity of cacha¸ca and do not interfere with their
color or taste. The drink remains white and with its distinctive ﬂavor even after properly fortiﬁed in contact with the wood[2]. Detailed knowledge of the chemical and sensory composition
of cacha¸ca, as well as the maturation time, constitute important factors in controlling beverage
quality and evaluation of changes that may contribute to the improvement of production processes. This knowledge can contribute to the production process especially for small producers
and artisan industries.
De Souza[6] uses gas chromatography - olfactometry - to separate and characterize the odors
present in cacha¸ca and rum, these two products of sugarcane were compared and the patterns
identiﬁed from a descriptive sensory analysis. The disadvantage of this method is maintainability because it has high cost. [7] demonstrates the diﬀerentiation between cacha¸ca and rum by
using ionization mass spectrometry. The author used the principal component analysis (PCA),
statistical approach in which data are represented by a subset of its eigenvectors, noting the
type of wood (amburana -Amburana cearensis e jequitib´a - Cariniana legalis). His work contributes to further studies can use this technique for the identiﬁcation of artisanal and industrial
cacha¸ca as well as detection of adulteration by adding caramel and other substances such as
dyes.
Recent works use techniques of computer vision, neural networks, genetic algorithms and
statistical methods for food classiﬁcation. Wan[14] used the computer vision combined with
artiﬁcial neural networks. A structural and microscopic approach of wines to be classiﬁed was
used by analyzing the microstructure and texture, factor that inﬂuences the assignment of color
to the sample. Starting from the idea that diﬀerent wines have microstructural (microscopy)
and micrograph (particles) changes, the study aimed at extracting common features to deﬁne
a pattern. For such, neural networks were used for classifying samples. The presented results
conﬁrm that it is possible to classify the wine through its micrograph, allowing the use of the
features in other contexts. Boisier[3] uses ΔE based on the CIELab color space in the samples
and demonstrates the grouping according to the tones classiﬁed. The proposed goal was to represent the wines’ colors with limited number of colors that were called nuances. The application
of ΔE aimed at performing a comparison with the HVS model, observing the brightness, chromaticity and saturation, thus analyzing the color spectrum, sorting and grouping it according
to tone. The results are encouraging since they permit a precise characterization and reproduction of wine color. The RGB color model is an additive color system consisting of Red (Red)
Green (Green), and Blue (Blue). Additive colors are emitted or projected colors. The color
is generated by mixing various greetings light wave, causing a color sensation when it reaches
the eye. RGB formats, also known as true-color, use 8-bits per channel. The CIELab color
model is a subtractive color system. CIELab describes the basic colors in three qualities: L *
is lightness, a * and b * contain chroma information. L * is luminance, density measurement
of the intensity of a reﬂecting light in a given direction. The information a* and b* refers to
the amount of color [9].

Qiongshuai[12] in his analysis shows the gain from using genetic algorithms in lecture and
classiﬁcation of wines, combined with computer vision. Kruzlicova[10], evaluates data through
an artiﬁcial neural network and comparative method use the analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Cozzolino[5] proposed to investigate the relationship between sensory analysis, visibility (VIS)
and infrared spectroscopy (NIR) to evaluate the sensory properties of commercial varieties of
Australian wines by using the PCA (Principal Component Analysis).
The methods described in related articles do not address the variety of woods that can be
used, as well as aggregate usage of chemical data values obtained by the colorimeter and there
is no relation so far of digital photographs of samples using the RGB color model. Sometimes
works use only the chemical data, other use only data from colorimeter (CIELab color model)
and when using chemical data and data from the colorimeter, did not observe the RGB color
model. The colorimeter is generally described as any instrument that characterizes color samples to get an objective measure of color characteristics. In turn, such equipment is available in
research laboratories and industries. The relevant point is to make accessible this technology
regardless of the producer. Observing the instrumental methods, cost, maintainability and handling are performed by a specialist. With computer methods results can be achieved optimizing
time and resources.
Therefore, this paper proposes a method for classifying the aging process of cacha¸ca in order
to identify the wood and the aging time of a sample. Intersection of information obtained in
the chemical analysis with that extracted from colorimeters will be performed, as well as data
obtained by applying algorithms of images digital processing, digital photographs performed on
samples of cacha¸ca. It is used the technique of artiﬁcial neural networks to assess the inﬂuence
of types of wood and the time that cacha¸ca aging has in the color model obtained from digital
photographs (RGB) and colorimeter (CIELab). Two techniques of pattern recognition will be
used: neural networks and k-NN (K-Nearest Neighbor).

Materials and Methods

2.1

Samples

Cacha¸ca samples with up to 36 months of in casks aging of amburana (Amburana cearensis), oak
(Quercus spp) and nut (Bertholletia excelsa H.B.K) were evaluated. The aging time is described
every 4 months (4-8-12-16-20-24-28-32-36). All samples evaluated are from 4 barrels of each
timber. Thus, total number of samples to be analyzed are 36 samples per timber. Normative
Instruction No. 13 of MAPA (Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply)[11] deﬁnes on
the classiﬁcation of Brazilian cacha¸ca into three types: Aged cacha¸ca, premium cacha¸ca, extrapremium cacha¸ca. All types have alcohol content between 38% and 48% by volume at 20◦ C.
What diﬀers is the type of storage time in cask wood. Aged cacha¸ca has 50% of the sample
stored in wooden cask for at least one year. The premium chaca¸ca has in its entirety, aged in
wooden cask for at least one year and ﬁnally the extra-premium cacha¸ca, in its entirety, aged
in wooden cask for a period not less than three years.
The physical and chemical analyses were performed in the laboratories for beverage technology and physicochemical analysis of the School of Agronomy, Federal University of Goi´as.
The determination of pH, density, real alcohol content at 20 o C, volatile, ﬁxed and total acidity,
dry extract, phenolic compounds, color and antioxidant activity were performed on times 0, 2,
4, 6, 8, 10 and 12, i.e. 2 on 2 months of storage for observing changes during the aging period.
The analyses followed the following methodologies:
• pH (Features 4 and 5) - measured with digital potentiometer calibrated at 20◦ C;

Computer vision system

Subsequently, samples were photographed by digital camera Canon EOS REBEL XS with
setting ISO 100, aperture to 4.0mm and conﬁgured for RAW image that contains all of the
image data as captured by the camera sensor format. The ambient light to photograph the
samples was controlled by a device which allows the incidence of light in the opposite position
to the lens of the camera. A special ﬁlter will prevent reﬂections in the liquid and will allow
the capture of a digital image suitable for processing.

Figure 1: Computer Vision System
Figure 1 shows the project of the device designed to be used in this work, a technique inspired
by Sun[13] in his work for bovine meat classiﬁcation. The device measures were 50cm2 , with
translucent ﬁlter of 30cm2 , opening digital camera 10cm2 radius. The purpose of the device
is to control the environment of digital photography for better absorption of colors of the
target object, in this context the cacha¸ca, in order to observe a correlation between the color
characteristics obtained by the colorimeter (model CIELab L* a* b* - Lightness, redness and
yelowness) and the RGB model (Red, Green and Blue). Afterwards, assign white balance, a
process for removal of unreal colors, so that making white objects that appear being white
to our eyes. The color balance is previously made, both in photography and ﬁlm, to digital
photography. The color balance is related to neutrality and should not be confused with color
balance that painters and designers often apply for matching colors.

Pattern Recognition Algorithms

In this work is proposed the use of two algorithms for pattern recognition: artiﬁcial neural
network and k-NN. Both techniques use supervised learning type.
Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) are mathematical models for data analysis inspired in
neuronal structures of the brain. It is a connectionist model, with great power to solve complex
and non-linear problems, with application in several areas. A multilayer perceptron neural
network (MLP) with 11 neurons in the hidden layer will be used. The training algorithm used
was backpropagation.
Another method used is the k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor). Lazy type supervised learning
technique, introduced by Aha[1]. The general idea of this technique is to ﬁnd the k closest
labeled examples to that unlabeled; based on the labeling of the closest examples the decision
on the class of unlabeled example is made. The size of k in this work is 1 using the Euclidean
distance.
Due to the limited number of samples, the cross-validation technique was used to measure
the accuracy of classiﬁers. In this technique, samples are divided into n mutually exclusive
partitions. At each iteration a diﬀerent partition is used to test the classiﬁer and all the others
n-1 partitions are used to train the classiﬁer. The hit rate and error is the average of all rates
calculated for the n iterations. In this work we used the n equal to 10.

Results and discussion

The pool of colorimeter information, chemical analysis and digital photographs at the entrance
of the classiﬁers was carried out. Two pattern recognition algorithms were used: neural networks
and k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbor).
In the ﬁrst experiment is used as attributes only the chemical information, i.e. without
using the information from colorimeter and RGB model for identiﬁcation of the aging time and
wood. The results are shown in Table 4.

According to the results, both classiﬁers considered achieved high success rate using the
data of chemical analysis. The only caveat presented is that the result for the classiﬁcation of
the aging time using the k-NN obtained a relatively lower rate of accuracy (83.33%).

Besides chemical attributes, variables that make use of color information were measured
using the CIELab and RGB color model. Figure 2 shows the Fisher discriminative capacity for
chemical attributes, RGB and CIELab to the problem of classifying the type of wood and aging
time. As one can see, the attributes related to color information have more discriminability to
the problem of wood classiﬁcation. The attributes 16 and 20 have the highest discriminability.
For the problem of aging time classiﬁcation is possible to note from the Figure 2(b) that the
attributes of greatest discriminability are related to chemical data. Information related to
computer vision system has low discriminability to the problem. It is noteworthy that the
Fisher’s discriminability considers the attribute of univariate analysis, thus the use of the most
discriminative attributes does not imply a good classiﬁcation model.

features the chemical features has the major discriminability as showed in (b).
From the calculated discriminability, the two most discriminative variables for each problem considered for viewing a scatterplot of objects for the problems of wood and aging time
classiﬁcation were used. Figure 3(a) shows that the classiﬁcation of the wood type is a simpler
problem than the aging time classiﬁcation observed in Figure 3(b).

Satisfactory results for the problem of wood classiﬁcation can be obtained by using only the
attributes of the Computer Vision System (RGB and CIELab features) system. However, for
the problem of aging time classiﬁcation the results for both classiﬁers have a bad hit rate.
From the observation that the information related to colors may contain useful information
about the classiﬁcation problem considered in this paper, a new experiment was performed
using the chemical attributes from the CIELab color model.

From the results of Tables 8 and 9, one can see that the classiﬁer achieved high success rate
using chemical information associated with the CIELab attributes. Both classiﬁers considered
achieved high success rate compared to the classiﬁcation result of tables 4 and 5. There was
improvement in the success rate for the problem of wood classiﬁcation for both classiﬁers. In
the problem of aging type classiﬁcation, there was improvement only in the k-NN classiﬁer.
In the third experiment were used chemical attributes, the attributes of the RGB and

Conclusion

This paper proposed the use of pattern recognition algorithms to identify the type of wood and
aging time of cacha¸ca samples. From the results it was observed that for the wood classiﬁcation
problem was possible to obtain classiﬁers with 100% accuracy. Still to this problem, it was found
that the use of computer vision system only, without the use of chemical information is suﬃcient
to identify the wood type with high accuracy rate. For the problem of aging time classiﬁcation,
the best result (97%) was obtained by a neural network using the chemical information and the
information from the computer vision system.
