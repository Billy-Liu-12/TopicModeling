1 Introduction
Handoff is one of the key technologies in mobility management. To support session
mobility in the future ubiquitous and heterogeneous network environments, the research focus turns from horizontal handoff between homogeneous access technologies
to vertical handoff between heterogeneous access technologies.
According to the handoff direction, vertical handoff can be classified into upward
and downward handoff. Upward handoff is from the network with small coverage to
the network with large coverage, e.g. the handoff from WLAN to GPRS. The reverse
handoff is called downward. Different handoff directions bring notable asymmetry in
handoff scenarios, procedures and performance. There are two typical scenarios –
forced and unforced handoff. Forced handoffs are usually triggered by lower layer
events incurring the change of interface availability. Since only one interface is available, the handoff is obligatory to avoid communication interruption. Unforced handoffs are triggered by users actively according to user policies, preferences or
perceived QoS. And multiple interfaces are available simultaneously. Downward
handoff must be unforced, while upward handoff may be forced or unforced.
In order to ensure the independency of access technologies, vertical handoff is implemented at network layer or above. MIP (Mobile IP)[1][2] and mSCTP (mobile

Stream Control Transport Protocol)[3][4] are two typical vertical handoff protocols.
MIP operates at network layer and provides server-based handoff, while mSCTP
operates at transport layer and provides end-to-end based handoff. [5-10] propose the
vertical handoff schemes with simple performance analysis. Some handoff performance comparison of MIPv4 and mSCTP is made in [11]. But in all these works, the
asymmetry feature, forced handoff scenario and error-prone feature of wireless links
are not considered adequately. This paper analyzes the vertical handoff performance
of MIPv6 and mSCTP. Qualitative and quantitative results are given. The asymmetry
feature of vertical handoff and lossy feature of wireless links are considered. The rest
of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 gives the qualitative analysis based on
the unified analysis model. Section 3 gives quantitative results. Section 4 concludes
this paper, the main performance influencing factors are pointed out and possible
performance improvement schemes are discussed.

2 Vertical Handoff Performance Analysis
Generally, vertical handoff performance can be evaluated by handoff delay, handoff
packet loss and signaling overhead. Handoff delay refers to the connection interrupted
interval. Packet loss is often evaluated by the interval incurring loss. Signaling overhead is defined as the traffic caused by the signaling messages exchange during the
handoff. In wireline networks, it is denoted by the product of signaling message
packet size and transmission distance (hops). Considering the limited bandwidth on
wireless links, the product should be multiplied by a factor α , where α > 1 .
2.1 Unified Analysis Model
The handoff performance analysis is based on different subprocedure combinations
and sequences. The main subprocedures include: (1) L2 handoff: the link layer connection change procedure. (2) System discovery and movement detection: MN recognizes the change of network connectivity. (3) Access authentication: the necessary
procedure for handoff across heterogeneous access networks belonging to different
domains or operators. (4) Address configuration: the network assigns an IP address to
MN. (5) Handoff protocol signaling subprocedure: the signaling exchange for implementing the handoff, e.g. the location registration procedure in MIPv6, the setting
primary address procedure in mSCTP. (6) Assistant subprocedure: the handoff assistant operations, e.g. the unavailable IP address deletion in mSCTP.
2.2 Vertical Handoff Procedure and Qualitative Performance Analysis
A. Vertical Handoff Based on MIPv6
The forced vertical handoff procedure based on MIPv6 is illustrated in Fig.1, which
includes several serial subprocedures: L2 handoff, movement detection, access authentication, address configuration and MIPv6 location registration. The introduced
delay are denoted by TL 2 HO , TMoveDet , TAuth , TAddrCon and TRegis . We will analyze TMoveDet and TRegis ,
which are protocol-related. The others are determined by specific access technologies.

The movement detection adopts L3 detection [2]. MN continuously listens to the
RA (Router Advertisement) messages multicasted by the routers periodically with
interval Δ RA . If MN has not received any RA from the default router in Δ R A , it can
determine one RA miss. After several RA misses (here assumes three for a reasonable
tradeoff between efficiency and robustness), MN can confirm an IP connectivity
change. [12] defines the interval as 3-4s at least and 1350-1800s at most. In order to
support mobility efficiently, [2] decreases it to 30-70ms. Hence, the movement detection duration can be given by TMoveDet = 3iΔ RA .

The location registration procedure includes HA registration and CN registration.
[2] dictates that MN is permitted to send BU (Binding Update) to CN only after it
receives BA (Binding Acknowledgement) from HA, that is, HA registration and CN
registration are serial procedures.
In the unforced vertical handoff based on MIPv6, MN has multiple available networks simultaneously. As illustrated in Fig. 2, system discovery, authentication and
address configuration can be completed when MN continues communication through
the former network interface. Only after the handoff decision, the MIPv6 location
registration procedure is triggered for link switch.

The detailed performance for MIPv6-based forced and unforced handoff is summarized in Table 1. The packet loss is denoted by the duration incurring loss.
B. Vertical Handoff Based on mSCTP
mSCTP supports vertical handoff because of its multi-homing feature and DAR (Dynamic Address Reconfiguration) extension [13]. With the movement of MN, mSCTPbased handoff includes three DAR operations: adding new acquired IP address,
changing the primary IP address and deleting the unavailable IP address. All these
DAR operations are implemented through a couple of ASCONF and ASCONF_ACK
messages carrying different parameters. Fig. 3 illustrates the procedures of the downward unforced handoff and upward forced handoff.
The forced vertical handoff based on mSCTP includes three serial subprocedures:
movement detection, setting primary IP address and deleting unavailable IP address.

Because of the multi-homing feature, the new primary IP address is the existing and
authenticated address in the association. Hence, authentication and address configuration are not necessary.
mSCTP uses the path failure detection function [3] for movement detection. An error counter is maintained for the primary IP address. It will be incremented each time
the retransmission timer T3-rtx expires. When the error counter is incremented successively and exceeds the threshold PMR (Path Maximum Retransmissions), this
address is regarded as unreachable and the movement is detected. The initial value of
PMR i
T3

T3-rtx is RTOmSCTP
=1s. Hence, the movement detection duration is TMoveDet = ∑ i =0 2 RTOmSCTP .
The key signaling procedure for handoff based on mSCTP is changing the primary
IP address. The old IP deletion belongs to the assistant procedure. It incurs signaling
overhead but it should not be included in the handoff delay.
The unforced handoff includes several subprocedures: system discovery, authentication, address configuration, adding IP address, setting primary IP address. The former ones are completed when MN continues communication through the old interface. Only after handoff decision, the primary address is changed for path switch.
The detailed performance of mSCTP is summarized in Table 1. It is notable that
the packet loss in unforced handoff is 0 because mSCTP supports soft handoff.

2.3 Analysis of the Handoff Signaling Delay
Handoff signaling procedure is unaviodable in any scenario. In this part, we will
analyze the signaling delay ( TRegis in MIPv6 and TSetPrimAddr in mSCTP) in detail.
Considering the error-prone feature of wireless links, the delay incurred by the error

recovery mechanism should be taken into account. Refering to and extending the
analysis method in [14], the signaling delay analysis model is shown in Fig. 4. Here
the delay consists of five parts: TMN , TSAP and TCN (THA ) denote the average processing
delay at MN, SAP (Service Access Point, e.g. BS or AP), CN or HA,
Twireless and Twireline denote the average transmission delay over wireless and wireline links.

Fig. 4. The Handoff Signaling Delay Analysis Model

Assuming an M/M/1 queuing model for MN, SAP, HA and CN, according to the
queuing theory, the average processing delay at each entity is: TEntity = 1/( μEntity − λEntity ) ,
where λ and μ denote the signaling message arriving rate and processing rate. Assuming the distance between SAP and HA or CN is w (hops) and the average transmission delay per hop is t , we have Twireline = wi t . The average transmission delay over
wireless links will be discussed in the following parts.
A. Average Transmission Delay over Wireless Link in MIPv6
[2] defines timeout retransmission mechanism to ensure the reliable transmission of
BU and BA messages. The initial value and the threshold of the retransmission timer
are 1s and 32s [2], i.e., the max retransmission is N MIPv 6 = 5 .
Assuming the FER (Frame Error Rate) at link layer is p , the bandwidth of the
wireless link is B bps and the inter-frame time is τ s, for the IP packet with size L , the
frame numbers contained in it is k = L /( Biτ / 8) .
For the HA registration procedure, the transmission error of either BU or BA will
incur retransmission. Success registration implies both BU and BA are transmitted
successfully, the probability of which is pS = (1 − p) kBU + kBA . Therefore, with the maximum retransmission number N MIPv 6 , the success registration probability is given by:
P = p s + (1 − p s ) i p s + (1 − p s ) 2 i p s + ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ + (1 − p s ) N −1 i p s .Correspondingly, the average transmission delay over wireless link caused by HA registration is given by:

where T MtrIPa nv 6 = ( D + ( k B U − 1)τ ) + ( D + ( k B A − 1)τ ) is the transmission delay of BU and
BA over the wireless link and D is the end-to-end frame propagation delay.
Obviously, for CN registration, we have the similar result.
B. Average Transmission Delay Over Wireless Link in mSCTP
mSCTP forms packets from the ASCONF and ASCONF-ACK control chunks and
here we do not consider the bundling. mSCTP also uses retransmission mechanism
for reliable transmission [13]. The timer is T4-rtx with initial value 1s. Considering

MIPv6 and mSCTP Based Vertical Handoff

the multi-homing feature, the retransmission is implemented on the secondary path if
it exists. In addition, an individual retransmission timer is maintained for each path.
For the forced handoff, the secondary path does not exist and the retransmission
will be completed over the primary path. The maximum retransmission times should
be PMR=5 [3]. Therefore, assuming the same FER for primary and secondary paths,
we have similar conclusion to MIPv6.
For the unforced handoff, there exists the secondary path for retransmission and
the maximum retransmission times should be AMR (Association Maximum Retransmission) =10 [3]. Considering the individual retransmission timer for each path, the
average wireless transmission delay for unforced handoff can be given by:

whereas over the lower performance link in upward forced handoff. This causes the
difference in the signaling delay. Fig. 6 illustrates the components of the handoff delay
in each scenario. We can see the effects of the above two reasons apparently.
(2)Although authentication and address configuration are not necessary in mSCTPbased forced handoff, its handoff delay and packet loss is rather worse than MIPv6.
This is due to the long duration for movement detection. mSCTP is designed for wireline networks initially and many parameter values are not suitable for wireless and
mobile networks. E.g., the initial values of the retransmission timers are defined as 1s,
which incurs large delay for movement detection. Reversely, MIPv6 decreases the
interval between two successive RAs for better mobility supporting. This reduces the
movement detection delay efficiently. (3) In the unforced handoff, MIPv6 has larger
handoff delay. This is because MIPv6 requires the serial HA and CN registration. (4)
As for handoff packet loss, it is proportional to the handoff delay in most scenarios. In
mSCTP-based unforced handoff, the loss is 0 because mSCTP supports soft handoff.
3.2 Handoff Signaling Delay Comparison
Handoff signaling delay is the unavoidable component in any scenario. In unforced
handoff, it is the major part of handoff delay. The signaling delay with the variation of
FER is shown in Fig. 7, and Fig. 8 illustrates the detailed composition.

Fig. 8. Components of Signaling Delay

For both MIPv6 and mSCTP, the signaling delay of upward forced handoff is obviously lager than that of downward unforced handoff. We can see in Fig.8, the main
difference exists in the wireless part transmission delay. This is because the packet
loss rate at upper layer and the end-to-end frame propagation delay of lower bandwidth link are all larger than higher bandwidth link. In addition, the signaling delay of
MIPv6 is lager than mSCTP due to the serial HA and CN registrations.

4 Conclusions
Performance Analysis and comparison of the MIPv6 and mSCTP based vertical handoff in different scenarios are given in this paper, considering the asymmetry in handoff directions, scenarios, procedures. Numerical results show that the handoff
performances, especially the forced handoff performance based on standard protocols
are not satisfying. For the more and more delay-sensitive realtime services with maximum acceptable interruption about 200ms, such a performance will be unacceptable.
Therefore, it is stringent to improve the handoff performance.

MIPv6 and mSCTP Based Vertical Handoff

529

The main reasons include: (1) in forced handoff, the serial procedures such as
movement detection, authentication and address configuration incur considerable
delay; (2) the low bandwidth and error-prone feature of wireless link introduce high
message transmission delay for error recovery; (3) some parameters defined in the
standard protocols can not support handoff in wireless mobile networks efficiently.
The possible methods to improve the vertical handoff performance include: (1) In
forced handoff, cross-layer interaction should be introduced to provide lower layers
information to upper layer handoff protocols. This is helpful to avoid long movement
detection delay and realize proactive handoff control rather than reactive handoff. The
serial relationships can be changed, e.g. pre-authentication, pre-address-configuration,
pre-registration etc. MIH (Media Independent Handoff) [16] defined by IEEE 802.21
WG provides an efficient cross-layer interaction mechanism. (2) Some parameters
defined in the protocol standards should be modified for more efficient mobility supporting. (3) Special measures should be adopted to reduce the handoff packet loss.
Soft handoff is another issue in handoff performance optimization.
