Abstract. Computers are now extensively used throughout science, engineering, and medicine. Advances in computational geometric modeling, imaging, and
simulation allow researchers to build and test models of increasingly complex
phenomena and thus to generate unprecedented amounts of data. These advances
have created the need to make corresponding progress in our ability to understand
large amounts of data and information arising from multiple sources. In fact, to
effectively understand and make use of the vast amounts of information being
produced is one of the greatest scientific challenges of the 21st Century.
Visual computing, which relies on and takes advantage of, the interplay among
techniques of visualization, computer graphics, virtual reality, and imaging and
vision, is fundamental to understanding models of complex phenomena, which
are often multi-disciplinary in nature. In this talk, I will first provide several examples of ongoing visual computing research at the Scientific Computing and
Imaging (SCI) Institute as applied to problems in computational science, engineering, and medicine, then discuss future research opportunities and challenges.
