Abstract
The objective of traditional goal-oriented strategies is to construct an optimal mesh that minimizes the problem size needed to achieve a user prescribed tolerance error for a given quantity
of interest (QoI). Typical geophysical resistivity measurement acquisition systems can easily
record electromagnetic (EM) ﬁelds. However, depending upon the application, EM ﬁelds are
sometimes loosely related to the quantity that is to be inverted (conductivity or resistivity), and
therefore they become inadequate for inversion. In the present work, we study the impact of
the selection of the QoI in our inverse problem. We focus on two diﬀerent acquisition systems:
marine controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM), and magnetotellurics (MT). For both applications, numerical results illustrate the beneﬁts of employing adequate QoI. Speciﬁcally, the
use as QoI of the impedance matrix on MT measurements provides signiﬁcant computational
savings, since one can replace the existing absorbing boundary conditions (BCs) by a homogeneous Dirichlet BC to truncate the computational domain, something that is not possible when
considering EM ﬁelds as QoI.

Introduction

A map of the Earth’s subsurface is employed in multiple applications, including hydrocarbon
exploration, CO2 -sequestration, and oil prospection. To obtain such a map, multiple measurements can be recorded (such as EM, elasto-acoustics, and nuclear) both on the surface or using
logging instruments. These measurements are subsequently inverted to obtain the material
properties of the Earth’s subsurface, and hence, to image it.

In the present work, we consider two diﬀerent on surface resistivity acquisition systems:
marine controlled source electromagnetics (CSEM) [7] and magnetotellurics (MT) [15], both
governed by Maxwell’s equations. These two scenarios are depicted in Figure 1. In marine

Earth’s subsurface.

CSEM, a towed electric-dipole repeatedly generates electric ﬁelds at diﬀerent locations, and the
response after interacting with the geological formation is recorded by the seaﬂoor receivers.
Depending on the depth of the target area, the transmitter operating frequencies may range
from 0.1 to 10 Hz and the source-receiver oﬀsets can be up to 10 km (see, e.g., [7]). In MT,
natural sources located at the ionosphere are responsible for the MT signals. The receivers
in MT are equivalent to CSEM receivers; hence, it is possible to record both MT and CSEM
measurements in one survey and employ them together for an improved understanding of the
subsurface geology.
While the above measurement acquisition systems can easily record EM ﬁelds, these may be
of no interest for inversion. In particular, for MT, the intensity of the source is unknown, and
therefore it is impossible to invert for the electric and magnetic ﬁelds, which directly depend
on it. As a result, the inversion is often performed with data based on impedances (or a
postprocessed quantity from the impedance, e.g. the apparent resistivity [16]).
In marine CSEM, the recorded EM ﬁelds contain information both about the subsurface
and the wave traveling throughout the sea, and possibly the air in shallow waters. The wave
traveling through the water and air contains no valuable information for inversion. Thus, it
is convenient to remove it from our measurements. This can be achieved by considering a
secondary ﬁeld formulation [3].
The QoI for the adaptive process should ideally match with that employed for the inversion.
In the present work, we study various QoI that are suitable for inversion in MT and marine
CSEM. A proper selection of a QoI is essential to obtain optimal results when employing goaloriented adaptivity [13, 14].
The main contribution of this paper is to illustrate how some QoI are more related to the
material properties than others. Moreover, we show that discretization errors associated to the
EM ﬁelds and to the QoI used for inversion highly diﬀer, especially when the full formulation
is employed. One extreme example of this situation corresponds to the case of MT, where a
perfectly matched layer (PML) [2] is unnecessary when computing impedances rather than EM
ﬁelds. This provides further computational savings.
We solve the forward MT problem with an hp-Finite Element Method (FEM) [6, 8], employing a multigoal-oriented strategy (proposed in [10]) to build the hp-grid. The simulations

of 3D marine CSEM measurements are obtained with a domain decomposition method [4].
The present paper is organized as follows: we start with the formulation of the problem
in Section 2. Then, in Section 3 we describe which QoI are interesting for the considered
geophysical electromagnetic applications. Section 4 is devoted for numerical results and ﬁnally,
in Section 5 we provide some conclusions and point out to some future research directions.

Formulation

Assuming a time-harmonic dependence of the form ejωt , pre-multiplying both sides of Faraday’s
law by μ−1 , applying the curl, and using Amp`ere’s law, we obtain the reduced wave equation,
∇ × (μ−1 ∇ × E) − k2 E = −jωJ imp − ∇ × (μ−1 M imp ),

(1)

where k2 = ω 2 ε − jωσ. Here, E corresponds to the electric ﬁeld, driven by an impressed
prescribed electric and magnetic density current sources, J imp and M imp . j is the imaginary
unit, ω is the angular frequency, σ stands for the conductivity of the media, ε for the electrical
permitivity, and μ for the magnetic permeability. We assume that the material properties are
given by diagonal 3 × 3 matrices with σ, ε0 and μ0 in their diagonals, respectively, where ε0 and
μ0 are assumed to be these of vacuum.
Secondary Field Formulation: A possible approach for solving Maxwell’s equations consists of splitting the electric and magnetic ﬁelds into their primary and secondary components.
The ﬁrst one corresponds to the ﬁelds arisen from some reference conductivity model σ P while
the second one arises from the diﬀerence between the actual conductivity distribution σ, with
respect to the reference model, that is, σ S = σ − σ P . Then, being ΩS the domain where the
higher dimensional inhomogeneities are located, σ S is equal to zero outside ΩS .
Thus, the equation for the secondary electric ﬁeld (1) becomes:
∇ × μ−1 ∇ × E S

− k2 E S = −jωσ S E P ,

(2)

where E P corresponds to the primary ﬁeld and E S is the secondary ﬁeld, which equals to
ES = E − EP .

2.1

Variational Formulation

We deﬁne the L2 -inner product of two possibly complex and vector valued functions f1 and f2
as:
f1 , f2 L2 (Ω) =
f1 ∗ f2 dΩ,
(3)
Ω

where f ∗ denotes the adjoint (transpose of the complex conjugate) of f . We pre-multiply both
sides of equation (2) by the adjoint F ∗ of a vector-valued test function F ∈ V (Ω) = {F ∈
L2 (Ω) : (n × F )|ΓD = 0, ∇ × F ∈ L2 (Ω)}, integrate by parts over domain Ω, and incorporate
the perfect electrically conductive boundary condition (n × E)|ΓD = 0. Thus, the variational
formulation for the secondary ﬁeld is given by:

2D Case: Transverse Electric (TE) Mode. Our aim is to ﬁnd the y component of the
electric ﬁeld Ey (x, z) ∈ Ω, satisfying the homogeneous Dirichlet BCs and equation (1). The
corresponding variational formulation is analogously obtained, where now V (Ω) = {F ∈ L2 (Ω) :
F |ΓD = 0, ∇F ∈ L2 (Ω)} and ∂/∂y = 0.

2.2

Solution Method

We employ an hp-FEM [6] to solve the forward MT problem. Since we have more than one
receiver, we need to simultaneously compute several quantities of interest (one per receiver).
Therefore, for the 2D computations, we employ a multigoal-oriented strategy, proposed in [10]
and employed also in [1], where a new linear QoI that takes into account all receivers is used.
The simulations of 3D marine CSEM measurements are obtained with a domain decomposition
method [4]. It combines H(curl) ﬁnite elements with Fourier basis functions. The zones of
the computational domain where it is reasonable to represent geoelectric properties in 2D are
discretized by combining 2D FE with a Fourier series [12]. The remaining part is discretized
utilizing traditional H(curl) 3D FE methods. The resulting discretization delivers highly accurate simulations of marine CSEM problems with arbitrary 3D geometries while it considerably
reduces the computational complexity of full 3D FE simulations for typical marine CSEM
problems.

Quantities of Interest

In the scope of subsurface modelling, the choice of the QoI is important for both, direct and
inverse problems. In marine CSEM, the EM ﬁelds are typically employed for inversion. In MT,
due to the lack of knowledge of the source properties, the impedance tensor or a postprocessed
quantity from the impedance is employed.
The traditional theory of goal-oriented adaptivity employs as QoI a linear and continuous
functional [11] in u associated to the i-th receiver and deﬁned as
Li (u) =

1
|ΩRi |

ΩR i

u dΩ,

(5)

where ΩRi is the domain occupied by the i-th receiver and u corresponds to some component of
the electric or magnetic ﬁeld. Thus, for the secondary ﬁeld formulation, because of the linearity
of Li (omitting the i-th super script for the sake of simplicity from now on), we have that for
each receiver
L(u) = L(uP ) + L(uS ).
(6)
To only employ a linear QoI is a signiﬁcant restriction. Therefore, in addition to linear QoI,
we also study the performance of nonlinear ones. In MT, our aim is to obtain retry information
of the electric conductivity distribution of the subsurface. Since the MT source intensity is
unknown, it is then necessary to deﬁne a QoI independent of it. A good candidate for this
purpose is the impedance matrix Z, a nonlinear quantity that is given by the ratio between
the electric and magnetic ﬁelds. For the 2D MT problem, two uncoupled modes can be derived
from Maxwell’s equations, the so called transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM)
modes. Then, we deﬁne impedances related to each of them as:

To see the relation between the impedance matrix and the subsurface resistivity distribution,
we consider a simple one-dimensional case given by a stratiﬁed model over which a linearly
polarized plane wave incides. For this case, Cagniard [5] showed in 1953 that the solution in
each layer n of height hn is given by:
Eyn (z, ω) = An ejγn z + Bn e−jγn z ,

Hxn (z, ω) =

(An ejγn z − Bn e−jγn z ),

(9)

where coeﬃcients An and Bn are dependent of interface conditions. γn = jωμσn − ω 2 με and
σn are the wavenumber and conductivity associated to the n-th layer. The impedance at the
surface is then given by:
Zkl =

(10)

where k and l can be either x or y. The impedance is then independent of the source J imp . In
particular, for the half-space case, C = ±1 (depending upon the involved ﬁelds) in the above
deﬁnition and therefore,
Zkl =

which in the special case of the half-space corresponds to the actual one. For more complex
scenarios it is then an approximation which corresponds to an average of the subsurface resistivities, as illustrated in Figure 2. Thus, it is directly related with the actual subsurface
resistivity distribution.
We focus on the electric ﬁeld and compute it in two diﬀerent ways. First, we employ the
full ﬁeld formulation, and compute the total electric ﬁeld at the receivers, which we denote

as QF
E (σ). Second, we use the secondary ﬁeld formulation, consider the secondary ﬁeld as the
QoI, and compute it numerically. After that, we calculate the total ﬁeld at the receivers by
incorporating the primary ﬁeld solution obtained analytically (or semi-analytically in the case
of marine CSEM). We denote it by QSE (σ). The same approach is followed for the impedance,
S
and the resulting quantities are denoted as QF
Z (σ) and QZ (σ), respectively.

Thus, QE (σ) and QZ (σ) correspond to the quantities obtained with the full ﬁeld formulation,
while QSE (σ) and QSZ (σ) to the ones computed with the secondary ﬁeld formulation. In the next
section, we compare the performance of these quantities.

Numerical Results

In this section, we study how the selection of the QoI aﬀects to the accuracy of our forward
direct solver.

4.1

MT

The physical problem is illustrated in Figure 3a. The computational domain consists of air
(above) and a layered media containing some 2D inhomogeneities. To treat the incoming
electromagnetic ﬁelds as plane waves that propagate in the vertical direction towards the Earth’s
surface, we model the source (located at the ionosphere and represented with a dark blue
rectangle) as an inﬁnitely long (in x and y directions) rectangular surface. The receivers (red
crosses) are located at the Earth’s surface. Figure 3a illustrates the computational domain
when the secondary ﬁeld formulation is considered. The light area represents the new (smaller)
computational domain. In this case, the source is located at the 2D inhomogeneities, namely,
the box with conductivity ρ4 . In both cases, the physical domain is truncated with a PML.
The relative permittivity and permeability are the same for all materials, and equal to one.
The values for the conductivity are (ρ1 , ρ2 , ρ3 , ρ4 ) = (3, 2, 4, 200) Ohm.m, the frequency 0.05
Hz, and the forcing term Jyimp = 1.

In the following ﬁgures, we represent the relative error between the numerical and reference
solutions against the number of unknowns. In all of them, the increase in the unknowns comes
from global reﬁnements in h and/or p, while the reference solution always corresponds to an
overkill solution, computed with the multigoal-oriented algorithm [10]. This algorithm needs
linear QoI to perform the adaptivity, and since the impedance is nonlinear, we employ the

electric ﬁeld. In the particular case of the impedance, which up to a constant, it corresponds to
the electric ﬁeld divided by its derivative, we can ensure the goodness of the reference solutions.
The relative error is deﬁned between these two solutions at the center of the domain, which is
the region more inﬂuenced by the presence of the inhomogeneity.
In a ﬁrst step, we compare the electric ﬁeld and impedance as QoI for both, full and secondary ﬁeld formulations. In Figures 4a and 4c (left column) we display the relative error for
the electric ﬁeld and the impedance with the full ﬁeld formulation, while in Figures 4b and 4d
(right column) we employ the secondary ﬁeld formulation. In both cases, the impedance provides more accurate results than the electric ﬁeld itself, especially for the full ﬁeld formulation,
where the diﬀerence is by several orders of magnitude. For the secondary ﬁeld formulation, the
advantage of using the impedance as QoI diminishes, although it still exhibits a smaller error.

If we compare the errors given by both formulations, for the electric ﬁeld (QF

and for the impedance (QZ (σ) and QZ (σ)), it is clear that the secondary ﬁeld formulation
always provides smaller errors for both physical magnitudes, even more for the electric ﬁeld,
which shows a large error (up to a 30%), when a coarse mesh is employed.

ceivers, which we denote as QF
E (σ). Second, we use the secondary ﬁeld formulation, consider the
secondary ﬁeld as the QoI, and compute it numerically. After that, we calculate the total ﬁeld at
the receivers incorporating the primary ﬁeld solution obtained analytically (or semi-analytically
in the case of marine CSEM). We denote it by QSE (σ). The same approach is followed for the
S
impedance and the resulting quantities are denoted as QF
Z (σ) and QZ (σ), respectively.
We now compute the same QoI without considering a PML. Being the air a non dissipative
media, and since we employ Dirichlet homogeneous boundary conditions for truncation purposes, we expect to have numerical reﬂections from the boundary and hence inaccurate results.
We again compare in Figures 4c and 4d the electric ﬁeld and the impedance when employing
the full and the secondary ﬁeld formulation, respectively. In the ﬁrst case, the electric ﬁeld
solution contains 100% relative error even when the number of unknowns in large, as expected.
However, the impedance shows a superb accuracy. Now it is unnecessary any eﬀort in the
truncation of the domain, which in general procure savings in both, computational complexity
and implementation tasks. When the secondary ﬁeld is employed, we obtain acceptable results
for the electric ﬁeld due of the attenuation of the source, which is embedded in a lossy media.
However, we still observe that the relative error does not converge to zero when computing the
electric ﬁeld, while the impedance rapidly convergences.
We conclude that the impedance is not only more closely related to the formation conductivity, but it also provides dramatically smaller discretization errors, leading to large computational
savings. As a result, the impedance is a better choice as QoI in comparison with the electric
ﬁeld.

4.2

Marine CSEM

In this subsection, we compare the relative error for FFE method when applied to solve the full
vs secondary ﬁeld formulations. The frequency excited by the horizontal electric dipole is equal
to 0.25 Hz and the transmitter is located 50 m above the sea-ﬂoor with (x, y) coordinates equal
to (0, 0). There are ten equally spaced receivers located on the sea-ﬂoor at horizontal distances
varying from 1 km to 10 km.
The horizontally stratiﬁed geoelectric model (1D model) considered here to compute the
primary ﬁeld (EP ) consists of an air layer with resistivity 108 Ohm.m, a seawater layer with
thickness 1.5 km and resistivity 0.3 Ohm.m, a sea-bottom layer with thickness 1.1 km and
resistivity 1.0 Ohm.m, a layer with thickness 1.1 km and resistivity 2 Ohm.m, a layer with
thickness 500 m and resistivity 1.5 Ohm.m, and a more resistive basement layer with resistivity
5 Ohm.m.
The 3D model is derived from the 1D geoelectric one by including a 3D resistive target
(resistivity equals to 100 Ohm.m) with ﬁnite size in all axes directions. The geoelectric model
is illustrated in Fig. 5. The extension of the resistive target (black color) is 3 km, 6 km and
100 m in the x, y and z directions, respectively.
Figure 6a describes the relative error (integral equation (IE) method (see, e.g., [9]) versus
FFE method) in percent of the electric ﬁeld obtained with FFE method for the full ﬁeld formulation (solid line) and the secondary ﬁeld formulation (dashed line) when applied to the
model problem of Figure 5. The FFE method for the secondary ﬁeld formulation delivers very
accurate results with a signiﬁcantly lower number of unknowns. About 25% of the unknowns
is suﬃcient to provide a better accuracy when using the secondary ﬁeld formulation. An error
level below 10% is acceptable and corresponds to what it is considered an accurate solution in
the context of marine CSEM measurements, since the anomaly produced by the presence of
an oil box is considerably larger (between 10% and 80%, See Figure 6b). Figure 6b shows the

Conclusions

We have analyzed the selection of the QoI in the context of two resistivity geophysical applications: MT and marine CSEM. In both cases, we observe that the secondary ﬁeld formulation
provides higher accuracy, and it is more sensitive to variations in the subsurface conductivity
distribution. Therefore, one should refrain from using the total EM ﬁeld as QoI. Additionally,
for the particular case of MT, we show that discretization errors of EM ﬁelds and the impedance
matrix highly diﬀer. In particular, computing impedances rather than EM ﬁelds provides high
computational savings. Additionally, the use of impedances enable to accurately solve the problem even when employing simply homogeneous Dirichlet BCs to truncate the computational
