Abstract. In the first part of this article, we derive a New Isothermal
Quantum Euler model. Starting from the quantum Liouville equation,
the system of moments is closed by a density operator which minimizes
the quantum free energy. Several simplifications of the model are then
written for the special case of irrotational flows. The second part of the
paper is devoted to a formal analysis of the asymptotic behavior of the
quantum Euler system in two situations: at the semiclassical limit and at
the zero-temperature limit. The remarkable fact is that in each case we
recover a known model: respectively the isothermal Euler system and the
Madelung equations. Finally, we give in the third part some preliminary
numerical simulations.

Introduction

Various works have been devoted in the past decade to the derivation of quantum
hydrodynamic models for semiconductors in order to simulate nanoscale devices
such as tunneling diodes or lasers. The interest in such models comes from the
fact that they are supposed to describe quantum transport in highly collisional
situations and to be computationally less expensive than corresponding quantum
microscopic models, such as the Schrödinger equation or the Wigner equation.
To design quantum hydrodynamic models with temperature eﬀects, the route
which has been usually followed consists in incorporating to classical ﬂuid models
some “quantum” correction terms, based on the Bohm potential [5,6,7]. However,
such approaches are not obvious to justify from physical principles. Moreover,
quantum corrections involving the Bohm potential produce high order terms in
these systems and make their resolution diﬃcult, from the mathematical and
numerical points of view.
In 2003, Degond and Ringhofer proposed in [3] a diﬀerent manner to derive
quantum hydrodynamic models, by closing the systems of moments thanks to
a quantum entropy minimisation principle. This systematic approach, which
is an extension of Levermore’s moment method to the framework of quantum
mechanics, seems very fruitful, although it is still formal. Following this ﬁrst

paper, an entropic quantum drift-diﬀusion model has been derived, analyzed and
then discretized numerically in [4]. Numerical comparisons of this model with
existing quantum transport models in [2] showed that it is a good candidate
model for quantum device simulations in diﬀusive regimes.
It has been possible to rewrite recently in [1] the isothermal quantum hydrodynamic model in a simpler and diﬀerential way. In this article, we remind the
methodology used to derive this model.
We also investigate several asymptotic limits for this model: at the semiclassical limit and at the zero-temperature limit. The remarkable fact is that in each
case we recover a known model: respectively the isothermal Euler system and
the Madelung equations.
Some simpliﬁcations of the model for the special case of irrotational ﬂows
allow us to present some preliminary numerical results in one dimension.
We ﬁnish this introduction by giving some possible applications of the Quantum Euler model. We ﬁrst have in mind the semiconductor industry where engineers have ﬁrst introduced Hydrodynamics models with 2 quantum corrections
in order to simulate nanoscale devices such as the so-called Resonant Tunneling
Diode. The use of these models have permitted to exhibit interesting features of
RTD such as negative resistance or hysteresis. The Quantum Euler model could
be also used in quantum chemistry, or other areas of physics such as quantum
optics, the study of superﬂuidity, etc...

Derivation of the Model

2.1

The Underlying Quantum Microscopic Model

At the microscopic scale, a quantum system evolving in R3 and subject to a potential V (x, t) can be described by a time-dependent density operator satisfying
the quantum Liouville equation:
i ∂t = [H, ρ] + i Q( ),
where

(1)

is the scaled Planck constant and H is the Hamiltonian:
H=−

2

2

Δ + V (x, t),

(2)

and Q(ρ) is an unspeciﬁed collision operator which describes the interaction
of the particles with themselves and with their environment and accounts for
dissipation mechanisms. By a density operator, we shall always mean a positive, Hermitian, trace-class operator acting on L2 (R3 ). Let W [ ](x, p) denote
the Wigner transform of ρ:
W [ ](x, p) =

iη·p
1

dη,
x − η, x + η e
2
2

where (x, x ) is the distribution kernel of :
ψ=

(x, x )ψ(x ) dx .

(3)

The inverse Wigner transform (or Weyl quantization) is given by the following
formula:
ip(x−y)
x+y
dp dy
, p ψ(y)e
W −1 [w]ψ(x) = w
,
(4)
2
(2π )3
and deﬁnes W −1 [w] as an operator acting on the element ψ of L2 . The Wigner
transform W and its inverse W −1 are Isometries between L2 (the space of operators such that the product † is trace-class, where † is the Hermitian conjugate
of ) and L2 (R2d ):
Tr{ σ † } =

dx dp
.
(2π )3

W [ ](x, p)W [σ](x, p)

(5)

Taking the Wigner transform of (1), we get the following collisional Wigner
equation for w = W [ ]:
∂t w + p · ∇x w + Θ [V ]w = Q(w),

(6)

with
Θ [V ]w = −

(V (x +

η)) ×

×w(x, q) eiη·(p−q) dq dη.

(7)

and Q(w) is the Wigner transform of Q( ).
2.2

The Moment Method

If we suppose that the collision operator conserves the mass and momentum,
integrations with respect to the variable p ∈ R3 enable to obtain equations
for the ﬁrst two moments n(t, x) = w(t, x, p) (2πdp )3 (the mass density) and
n(t, x)u(t, x) =

p w(t, x, p) (2πdp )3 (the current density):
∂t n + ∇ · nu = 0,
∂t (nu) + ∇Π + n∇V = 0.

(8)
(9)

Of course, this system of equations is not closed, since the pressure tensor Π is
still expressed in terms of the microscopic Wigner function w(t, x, p):
Π=
Rd

p⊗pw

dp

(2π )3

(10)

The quantum Euler model is thus complete only as soon as the closure assumption is made precise. Hence, by analogy with Levermore’s methodology [9] and
according to [3], we close the system by replacing the expression (10) of Π by
another one in terms of n and nu:
dp

p ⊗ p wn,nu

(11)
Π=

where wn,nu
n,nu ] is the so-called quantum Maxwellian, depending only
on n and nu in a non local (and non explicit) way, as deﬁned in next subsection.

The Quantum Free Energy Minimization Principle

We intend to describe the eﬀect of the interaction of a quantum system, subject
to a potential V , with a thermal bath at temperature T . To this aim, it is
convenient to introduce the quantum free energy deﬁned by:
G( ) = Tr {T ( (log − 1)) + H } .

(12)

2

where H = − 2 Δ + V is the Hamiltonian.
The main assumption concerning the interaction between the system and the
thermal bath is that the ﬁrst two moments n and nu are conserved during these
interactions. According to this statement, we now claim the quantum free energy
minimization principle (the reader can refer to [3] for details). Let the functions
n and nu be given. Consider the following constrained minimization problem:
min G( ) such that

W[ ]

dp
= n and
(2π )3

pW[ ]

dp
= nu . (13)
(2π )3

The solution, if it exists, is called the local equilibrium density operator (or
quantum Maxwellian) associated to n and nu. Lagrange multiplier theory for
the constrained problem (13) (see [3]) shows that there exist a scalar function
A and a vector function B, both real valued and deﬁned on R3 , such that this
local equilibrium density operator takes necessarily the form:
= exp −

(14)

where H(A, B) is the following modiﬁed Hamiltonian:
H(A, B) = W −1

(p − B)2 + A = (i ∇ + B) + A.

The Quantum Euler Model

According to the deﬁnition of the quantum Maxwellian (14) and to commutation
properties with the Hamiltonian, it is possible to simplify the pressure tensor
and to express it with respect to n, nu, A and B (see [1]) and we obtain the
following system:
∂t n + ∇ · nu = 0,
∂t (nu) + ∇(nu ⊗ B) + n(∇B) · (u − B) + n∇(V − A) = 0,

(16)
(17)

where the extensive quantities n and nu and the associated intensive ones A and
B are linked by the following constitutive equations:
n = W[

and where (λp , ψp )p∈N denotes the complete set of eigenvalues and normalized
eigenvectors of the modiﬁed Hamiltonian deﬁned by
H(A, B) =

(i ∇ + B) + A.

(19)

Special Case of Irrotational Flows

We conclude this section by dealing with the special case of irrotational ﬂows.
Let n, nu, A, B be given according to the deﬁnition of the quantum Maxwellian.
Assume moreover that u is an irrotational vector ﬁeld, i.e. that there exists S(x)
such that u = ∇S. Then B is deﬁned by
B = u = ∇S

(20)

In this case, the quantum Euler system (16)–(19) can be rewritten as follows:
∂t n + ∇ · nu = 0,
∂t (nu) + ∇(nu ⊗ u) + n∇(V − A) = 0,

(21)
(22)

where n and A are coupled by the constitutive equation:
exp −

n=

(23)

and where (λp , ψp )p∈N denotes the complete set of eigenvalues and normalized
eigenvectors of the modiﬁed Hamiltonian deﬁned by
H(A, 0) = −

Δ + A.
(24)
2
As we can see, the system is much simpler in this case since it does not depend
on B anymore. The only non-local relation links the intensive variable A to the
extensive one n.

Formal Asymptotics

We investigate here various asymptotic approximations of the quantum Euler
system as dimensionless parameters go to zero. Our aim here is to draw some
connections between this model and several other existing models.
3.1

Semiclassical Asymptotics

It is possible to perform an expansion of the “quantum Maxwellian” eq
n,nu . By
keeping in this expansion the terms up to the order O( 2 ), one gets formally
some approximate constitutive equations linking (n, nu) and (A, B):

where we have denoted ω = ∇ × u and n0 is the eﬀective density of state
3/2
n0 = 2πT 2
.
Then, inserting these equations (25), (26) in (16), (17), one gets an approximate quantum Euler model:
∂t n + ∇ · nu = 0,
∂t (nu) + ∇(nu ⊗ u) + T ∇n + n∇V −

n∇(|ω|2 ) = O( 4 ).

(28)

It is readily seen from (27) and (28) that, as → 0, the quantum Euler system
converges formally to the isothermal Euler system. Moreover, if we drop the
terms O( 4 ) in (27), (28), the obtained model is the so-called quantum hydrodynamic model [7], up to additional terms depending only on ω = ∇ × u. For
irrotational ﬂows, we recover the quantum hydrodynamic model. These observations were already made in [8].
3.2

The Zero Temperature Limit

An opposite limit to the semiclassical asymptotics is the zero-temperature limit.
Assume that the solution (nT , nT uT , AT , B T ) of the quantum Euler system
(16)–(19) with temperature T , admits a non trivial limit (n, nu, A, B) as
the dimensionless temperature T goes to zero. Then these functions satisfy the
Madelung equations:
(29)
∂t n + ∇ · nu = 0,

∂t u + (u · ∇)u + ∇V −

where C is a constant and the system is described by a pure-state:
(x, x ) = ψ(x) ψ(x ),
with
ψ=

(32)

and ∇S = u.

This gives a clear link between the quantum Euler model and the ﬂuid dynamic
expression of the Schrödinger equation.

with α the scaled Debye length. We have chosen for the parameters 2 /2T = 0.1
and α2 = 0.1. We choose an initial density concentrated on the left of the device
and take the initial velocity equal to zero. The external potential V ext is chosen
to be a double barrier (in fact, the device here is a simpliﬁed Resonant Tunneling
Diode without doping) and Figure 1 shows the evolution of the electron density
n(x) on the left, and the velocity u(x) on the right for t = 0, t = 0.1 and t = 1.
We can see electrons going through the barriers by tunneling eﬀect.

Conclusion and Perspectives

In this paper, we have written in a simpler and diﬀerential way the isothermal
version of the quantum hydrodynamic model derived in [3]. We have then written some formal asymptotics of the model as dimensionless parameters tend to
zero. It appears formally that the semiclassical limit of the model is the Classical
isothermal Euler system while the zero temperature limit of the model gives the
Madelung equations. We have also written several simpliﬁcations of the model
when the velocity is irrotational which allows us to perform numerical simulations on a simple 1D device. These preliminary numerical simulations seem to
indicate that the model gives meaningful results in realistic situations. The study
of the numerical scheme together with comparisons with other models will be
presented in a future article.
