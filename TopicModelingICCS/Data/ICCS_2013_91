Abstract
High-fidelity electromagnetic (EM) simulation is a very accurate but computationally expensive way of evaluating the performance of
microwave structures. In many situations, it has to be done multiple times when conducting various design tasks, such as parametric
optimization or statistical analysis. Fast and accurate models, so-called surrogates, are therefore indispensable in contemporary
microwave engineering. The most popular way of creating such models is by approximation of sampled EM-simulation data using, for
example, low-order polynomials, support vector regression or neural networks. Unfortunately, initial cost of creating such models may
be extremely high because of a large number of samples necessary to ensure reasonable accuracy. An alternative approach is to use
physics-based models, where the surrogate is created by correcting an auxiliary low-fidelity model, e.g., equivalent circuit. In this paper,
we review several modeling techniques exploiting this idea, including some variations of space mapping as well as shape-preserving
response prediction. Our considerations are illustrated using examples of typical microwave components such as filters and antennas.
Keywords: Microwave engineering, surrogate modeling, electromagnetic simulation, space mapping, shape-preserving response prediction.

1. Introduction
Accurate evaluation of microwave components and structures can be obtained using full-wave electromagnetic
(EM) simulation which became one of the fundamental design tools of contemporary microwave engineering. For
certain structures (e.g., filters), there exist simple theoretical models that can be used to obtain initial designs, however,
in many situations, EM-simulation-driven design is actually a must (substrate-integrated circuits [1], ultrawideband
antennas [2], or dielectric resonator antennas [3]). Unfortunately, a high-fidelity EM simulation is computationally
expensive, which might be a serious bottleneck for EM-simulation-based design tasks that require numerous
evaluations of the structure of interest, such as parametric optimization or statistical analysis. Therefore, accurate
and computationally cheap models of microwave structures are indispensable.
One of the most popular ways of constructing computationally cheap models is by using approximation
techniques such as polynomial regression [4], radial basis functions [5], kriging [6], [7], support vector regression
[8]-[11], fuzzy systems [12], [13], rational approximation [14], or artificial neural networks [15]-[18].
Approximation models, once created, are fast, but a large number of training points obtained through massive EM
simulations is necessary for good accuracy over the entire design space. Moreover, contemporary approximation

models rely on uniform data sampling [6], which results in an exponential growth of the number of training points
with respect to the dimensionality of the design space known as the curse of dimensionality. As a result, the
aforementioned approximation techniques are suitable for creating multiple-use library models rather than ad-hoc
models for solving design tasks such as parametric optimization.
This difficulty can be alleviated by exploiting physics-based models. In this approach, the surrogate model is
created by a suitable correction of the underlying low-fidelity model. One of the most popular techniques of this
kind in microwave engineering is space mapping (SM) [19]-[23]. A space mapping surrogate is constructed using a
simplified representation (low-fidelity or coarse model) of the microwave structure in question (high-fidelity or fine
model), e.g., an equ
of the coarse model. The enhancement of the coarse model is typically realized through suitable analytical formulas,
which allows the surrogate model to be almost as computationally cheap as the coarse model. However, because the
coarse model is supposedly physics-based, the accuracy of the space mapping surrogate is considerably better than
the accuracy of possible function approximation models using a comparable amount of fine model data [24].
One of the problems of space mapping is that the low-fidelity model has to be substantially faster than the highfidelity model because each evaluation of the SM surrogate involves an evaluation of the coarse model. Therefore,
equivalent circuit or analytical coarse models are preferred. However, for many structures, such models are not
available (e.g., wideband antennas, substrate integrated circuits) and the only alternative is coarse-discretization EM
simulation. Simulation models are relatively expensive (typically, only 5 to 50 times faster than the corresponding
high-fidelity models). To extend the applicability of SM to these cases, a modification of the standard SM has been
proposed [25], where the coarse model to be used by the SM surrogate is constructed through an approximation of
the coarse-discretization EM simulation data. This approach gives a reasonable tradeoff between the computational
cost and the accuracy of the surrogate model.
Another technique exploiting physics-based low-fidelity models, shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP), has
been reported in [26]. Similarly as SM, SPRP utilizes a computationally cheap coarse model of the microwave
structure in question. However, in contrast to SM, no extractable parameters are necessary, which makes it easy to
implement. Also, SPRP is based on modeling of the so-called characteristic points describing the response (e.g., Sparameters versus frequency) of the structure of interest rather than the response itself. In many cases, the dependence
between the location of the characteristic points and the design variables is much simpler than the dependence of the
original response. As a result, SPRP usually ensures better accuracy than SM [26]. On the other hand, SPRP has certain
limitations; in particular, it requires that the sets of characteristic points for any two sets of design variables are in oneto-one correspondence throughout the region of surrogate model validity [27], which may not always be possible to
satisfy.
In this paper, we briefly review and illustrate, using examples of typical microwave devices, a few physics-based
surrogate modeling techniques, including standard space mapping, space mapping with kriging interpolation, as well as
shape-preserving response prediction. We also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the presented techniques.

3. Surrogate Modeling Using Space Mapping
Space mapping (SM) [23] is a simple way of constructing the surrogate of a microwave structure by correcting
the underlying coarse model. The coarse model should be computationally cheap and physically-based so that a
good alignment between the surrogate and the fine model can be obtained by using a limited number of fine model
evaluations [23]. For these reasons, a preferred choice for the coarse model is an equivalent circuit.

Space mapping typically ensures reasonable accuracy while using a limited amount of fine model data.
Moreover, as the parameter extraction process (2) is independent of the evaluation point x of the surrogate model,
the accuracy of the model (1)-(2) is barely dependent on the number of the base points NSM.
As an example, consider the fourth-order ring resonator bandpass filter [34] shown in Fig. 4(a). The filter is
simulated using electromagnetic solver FEKO [35]. The space mapping surrogate model is constructed by correcting
the low-fidelity model which is an equivalent circuits shown in Fig. 4(b). The low-fidelity model is implemented in
Agilent ADS [36]. The design variables and the region of interest for our filter are the following (all sizes in mm):
x = [L1 L2 L3 S1 S2 W1 W2]T, x0 = [24 20 26 0.1 0.1 1.2 0.8]T, = [2 2 2 0.05 0.05 0.1 0.1] T. The surrogate model was
set up using 20 base points allocated within the region of interest using Latin Hypercube Sampling [37]. The
average modeling error measured as indicated in Section 2 using 50 random test points is 3.1 percent. Figure 5
shows the high-fidelity and the SM surrogate model responses at selected test points.

4. Surrogate Modeling Using Space Mapping and Kriging
As mentioned in the introduction, space mapping requires that the underlying low-fidelity model to be
substantially faster than the high-fidelity one. In many situations, fast low-fidelity models, particularly equivalent
circuits, are not available. On the other hand, low-fidelity models can always be obtained through coarsediscretization EM simulation. Such models are relatively expensive and usually quite noisy (mostly in the sense of
the numerical noise present due to adaptive meshing techniques). In order to expand the applicability of space
mapping to these situations, one can use intermediate response surface approximation models as suggested in [25].
More specifically, we construct the coarse model for the space mapping surrogate using functional approximation of
the data obtained from the coarse-discretization EM simulation (referred to as Rcd). In this way, an EM simulation is
only performed while setting up the model; the subsequent evaluation of the SM surrogate will not invoke the EM
simulator again.
Here, we use kriging [7] as the approximation method but other techniques such as radial basis function
interpolation [7] or support vector regression [8] can also be utilized.
xN} denote a base set, such that the responses Rcd(xj) are known for j = 1, 2,
N. Let
Let XB = {x1, x2,
Rcd.m(x)]T. Components of the model response vector may correspond to certain parameters,
Rcd(x) = [Rcd.1(x)
e.g., |S21| evaluated at m frequency points.
We focus on ordinary kriging [7] that estimates a deterministic function f as fp(x) = μ + (x), where μ is the mean
of the response at the base points, and is the error with zero expected value, and with a correlation structure being
a function of a generalized distance between the base points. We use a Gaussian correlation function of the form

The mean j is given by j = (1TR 11) 11TR 1fj. The correlation parameters k are obtained by maximizing
[Nln( 2) + ln|R|]/2 [7] in which the variance j2 = (fj 1 j)TR 1(fj 1 j)/N and |R| are both functions of k.
Function-approximation-based coarse models have a few important advantages: (i) they are fast and smooth, (ii) it is
possible to build an SM model for problems where finding reliable and fast coarse models such as equivalent circuits is
problematic (e.g., wideband antennas), and (iii) the accuracy of the function-approximation coarse model created from

874

coarse-discretization EM simulations is comparable to the accuracy of other possible coarse models (e.g., equivalent
circuit). It should be emphasized that although the coarse model (3)-(8) uses function approximation, it retains the
features of the physically-based model if the number of base points is sufficiently large. On the other hand, the
computational cost of creating such models is low: assuming that the typical number of training points is N = 100 to
200, and the typical evaluation time ratio between Rf and Rcd varies between 20 to 50, the cost of creating Rc would be
2 to 10 high-fidelity model evaluations, which is much less than for any method based on a direct approximation of the
fine model data only.
Consider a planar dipole antenna shown in Fig. 6. The antenna consists of the main radiator element and two
parasitic strips [38]. The design variables are x = [l0 w0 a0 lp wp s0]T. Other variables are: a1 = 0.5 mm, w1 = 0.5 mm.
Rogers RT5880 laminate is used for the substrate dielectric (substrate height h = 1.58 mm). The high-fidelity
antenna model Rf is simulated using the CST MWS transient solver [39] with evaluation time 44 minutes. The
coarse-discretization model Rcd is also simulated in CST MWS (evaluation time 100 seconds). The region of interest
is defined by the reference point x0 = [18.0 12.0 0.6 13.0 7.0 1.5] T mm, and the region size = [0.5 0.5 0.2 0.5 0.5
0.5]T mm. The kriging coarse model is created using N = 100 Rcd samples allocated using LHS [37]. The CPU-cost
of establishing the coarse model corresponds to less than four evaluations of the fine model. The SM surrogate has
been established using model (1) enhanced by frequency SM. Again, we considered two cases: (i) single-point base
set XB.SM = {x0}, and (ii) a star distribution base set [23] with the center at x0. Modeling accuracy has been verified
using 50 test points (Table 1). Figure 7 shows the fine and surrogate model responses at the selected test points.
Note that the modeling accuracy is quite good even if only one base design is used to set up the surrogate model. A
comparison with conventional kriging interpolation of the high-fidelity model data indicates that space mapping is
much more efficient that direct kriging interpolation, i.e., similar level of modeling error is obtained for much
smaller number of training samples.

5. Surrogate Modeling Using Shape-Preserving Response Prediction
Similar to space mapping, the shape-preserving response prediction (SPRP) technique [27] exploits a low-fidelity
model to create the surrogate. Versions of SPRP not relying on a low-fidelity model are also available [40]. In the
SPRP technique, the surrogate is constructed by tracking the response of the low-fidelity model. The response change
of Rc is described by the translation vectors corresponding to a finite number of the so-called characteristic points.
These translation vectors are subsequently used to predict the change of the entire high-fidelity model response.
The SPRP concept is explained in Fig. 7(a) using the coarse model responses of a microstrip bandstop filter [27] at a
certain design xr as well as at some other design x. Characteristic points of Rc(xr) are selected to represent |S21| = 3 dB,
|S21| = 20 dB, and the local |S21| maximum (at about 13 GHz). The squares denote corresponding characteristic points
for Rc(x), while the small pieces of lines
characteristic points of Rc when changing the design variables from xr to x. Because of Rc being physically based, the
fine model response at x can be predicted using the same translation vectors and the corresponding characteristic points
of the fine model response at xr, Rf(xr) (Fig. 7(b)).
Rf(x, m)]T and
SPRP can be rigorously formulated as follows [27]. Let Rf = [Rf(x, 1)
T
Rc(x, m)] denote the response vectors of the fine and coarse models, respectively, where j,
Rc = [Rc(x, 1)
m, is the frequency sweep. Let pjf = [ jf rjf]T, pjc0 = [ jc0 rjc0]T, and pjc = [ jc rjc]T, j = 1,
K, denote the
j = 1,
sets of characteristic points of Rf(xr), Rc(xr) and Rc(x), respectively, where xr is a reference vector and x is a vector
and r denote the frequency and magnitude
at which we want to estimate the fine model response. Here,
components of the respective point. The selection of the characteristic points should be determined by the defining
features of the response shape (e.g., local minima/maxima) as well as some other points (e.g., points corresponding to
specific values like 3 dB, 20 dB, etc.). The translation vectors of the Rc response are defined as tj = [ jt rjt]T,
c0

r
rm = Rc(x, m) Rc(x , m). The function F translates the frequency components of the characteristic points of Rf(xr)
into the frequencies where they should be according to the translation vectors tj, while the function R adds the
necessary magnitude component. The interpolation onto [ 1, m] is necessary because the original frequency sweep
is a discrete set. All interpolations are implemented through cubic splines. Generalizations of SPRP that help
defining the surrogate model in case when one-to-one correspondence between the sets of characteristic points of the
model responses may not be easy to preserve (which is a fundamental prerequisite of SPRP) can be found in [27].
Constructing the SPRP surrogate model, valid in a certain region of interest, based on the set of training points
xN}, is then straightforward. We define

Although, as demonstrated in [26], this simple modeling approach proves to be more accurate than SM, it has
some drawbacks. The model (10) utilizes only one base point at a time. As shown in Fig. 9(a), the region of interest
points x located in a given region
r
) is determined using the same single base point as a reference design. Due to
this, the surrogate does not utilize all available Rf data at a time. Also, the surrogate model is discontinuous at the
t
) is not unique at these points. This may cause some
problems while using the surrogate for design optimization.
A modified SPRP modeling technique has been proposed in [26] that utilizes multiple reference designs and
solves the discontinuity problem described in the previous section. Here, the base set is assumed to be allocated
using star-distribution [23], however, the model can also be formulated for more general setups. The concept of the
SPRP model exploiting multiple reference designs is explained in Fig. 9(b). For an evaluation point x, we find a
subset XS of the base set XB that defines a rectangular area (hypercube) of the region of interest containing x. The
surrogate model is set up using all points from XS. The star-distribution base set contains N = 2n + 1 points as
xn}. We have
illustrated in Fig. 9(b) for n = 2. Without loss of generality, we can assume that XS = {x0, x1,

Consider the coupled half-wavelength stepped impedance resonator (SIR) bandpass filter [41] (Fig. 10(a)). The
design parameters are x = [L1 L2 L3 L4 S W1 W2]T mm. The fine model is simulated in FEKO [35]. The coarse model

using (i) space mapping (cf. Section 3), (ii) standard SPRP, and (iii) modified SPRP. The comparison of the model
accuracies is shown in Table 2 and Fig. 11.

hypercube defined by a subset XS of base points being the closest to an example evaluation design x. The surrogate at x is defined as a linear
combination of SPRP models using all base points from XS as reference designs. Coefficients of this linear combination are calculated by
representing x through all points from XS.

6. Conclusions
Several methods for modeling of microwave components and structures exploiting physics-based surrogates have
been discussed. Thanks to utilizing the knowledge embedded in the low-fidelity models, whether it is equivalent
circuit or coarse-discretization EM simulation, techniques such as space mapping or shape-preserving response
prediction can be used to create fast representations of the structures of interest at a low computational cost. The
presented methods have been illustrated using examples of typical microwave components, including filters and an
antenna. Modifications of both space mapping and shape-preserving response prediction that allows their application
to a larger class of modeling problems or better utilization of available high-fidelity model data have also been
discussed.
