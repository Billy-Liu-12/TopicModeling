Abstract. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization model to plan
IEEE 802.11 broadband access networks. From a formal point of view,
it is a mixed integer non-linear optimization model that considers both
co-channel and inter-channel interference in the same compact formulation. It may serve as a planning tool by itself or to provide a performance
bound to validate simpler planning models such as those in [3].
Keywords: IEEE 802.11, mesh networks, rooftop, planning.

Introduction

In this paper, we propose an optimization model to generate IEEE 802.11 resource-sharing broadband access meshes, which users themselves often manage
[1]. Resource-sharing wireless networks based on IEEE 802.11 are not new [2]. In
our model, a basic node is composed by a cable/xDSL router, an 802.11 access
point and two 802.11 cards for interworking purposes. Basic nodes may serve a
LAN (covering a building, for example). This model may represent user-managed
rooftop networks linking building LANs, to share a pool of cable/xDSL accesses.
Our proposal relies on a set of rules to generate topologies with low co-channel
and inter-channel interference. From them, in a previous paper [3] we derived two
mesh deployment algorithms: a distributed one, to be executed by infrastructure
nodes themselves, and a centralized one via a mixed integer linear optimization
model. In this paper we enrich the centralized version, by adding co-channel
and inter-channel interference estimates that yield a mixed integer non-linear
optimization model. The new model may serve as a planning tool or to provide
a performance bound to validate previous planning models.
Our study is based on IEEE 802.11b because it has been the most extended
legal 802.11 substandard in the EU for a long time. It is straightforward to extend
the results of this work to other substandards like IEEE 802.11a or 802.11g.
This paper is organized as follows: section 2 reviews the work in [3]. Section
3 describes the new proposal, a mixed integer non-linear optimization model
satisfying the deployment rules in [3]. Section 4 presents numerical tests on a
realistic scenario –a sector in Vigo, Spain–. Section 5 concludes.

Distributed IEEE 802.11 Deployment Algorithm

A single access point per basic node is a natural choice, since it can manage connections from several wireless cards. Multiple access points per basic node would
compromise cell planning, due to the few channels available. According to our
previous work, two wireless cards per basic node yield satisfactory performance
and ensure network diversity and survivability.
2.1

IEEE 802.11b Channel Assignment

IEEE 802.11b has 13 DSSS (Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum) overlapping
channels. We wish to minimize co-channel and inter-channel interference in wireless infrastructure deployment. There is co-channel interference when two access
points (AP) employ the same channel, and inter-channel interference when APs
or wireless cards (WLCs) with overlapping channels transmit simultaneously.
We adopt the classic cellular planning algorithm in [4] to generate a channel
grid (Figure 1). We assign AP channels according to the cells they belong to.
The maximum legal range (without boosting equipment) of card-to-access point
connections is 170 meters (using a D-Link DWL-1000 AP and D-Link DWL-650
WLCs). IEEE 802.11b co-channel interference is negligible at distances over 50
m [5]. To mitigate co-channel and inter-channel interference, we allow a single
fully active basic node per cell (the rest become partially active, by disabling the
AP and one of the WLCs) and set cell edge length to 50 meters.

Fig. 1. Frequency pattern and cell grid

If there are several basic nodes in a cell, we need to decide which one is active.
We achieved the lowest interference level when the active node is close to the
cell center. Note that all basic nodes in a cell but the active one could be WLCs
to reduce costs. However, this solution restricts network evolution (basic nodes
can appear and disappear). Also, note that the cost per user is very low if the
basic node serves a LAN.
2.2

Setting Wireless Links

As soon as a basic node is active, its WLCs look for the closest AP (in signal
strength), i.e. the local one. The basic nodes ﬁlter the MAC addresses of their

468

E. Costa-Montenegro et al.

own WLCs. However, once a WLC in basic node A is connected to the AP in
basic node B, the latter must block the second card in A, since (i) overall capacity
is the same due to AP sharing and (ii) there would be less diversity otherwise.
It is possible to detect and avoid this one-way dual connection establishment
problem because both WLCs in A belong to the same addressing range.
When a WLC wants to join the AP in a remote basic node, the latter must
check if any of its WLCs have previously set a link in the opposite direction. The
requesting WLC must notify its IP range, and the remote basic node can check
if any of its own WLCs already belongs to that range (two-way dual connection
establishment problem). If so, it will deny the connection.
In zones with many basic nodes, another connection establishment problem
arises when some of them handle many connections. However, it is possible
to limit the number of connections per AP at IEEE 802.11b MAC level by
blocking association request frames from WLCs once the connection counter
reaches the limit, keeping a reasonable throughput per connection. This has a
second beneﬁcial eﬀect, because it favors network expansion at its edges.
We now consider co-channel and inter-channel interference. The former is
presumably low due to cellular planning and cell size, specially if inter-cell links
are short. Regarding inter-channel interference, if two physically adjacent IEEE
802.11b sources transmit with a two-channel separation, throughput drops to
50%, whereas a three-channel separation is practically enough to avoid interchannel interference. It may be quite common in our case. Thus, we consider an
inter-channel interference mitigation rule. If implemented, all elements in a basic
node (WLCs and AP) only set connections with mutual frequency separation of
at least three channels. This drastically reduces inter-channel interference.
2.3

Performance of the Distributed Deployment Algorithm

In [3], we simulated the distributed deployment algorithm on a realistic scenario
with a signiﬁcant number of basic nodes (≈ 50), corresponding to Vigo, Spain.
We observed that most WLCs got connected and the resulting mesh had link
diversity. Figure 2(a) shows the resulting network: black icons represent fully
active basic nodes, and “×” icons denote partially active ones (6 out of 46).
Access point degree is low: 2.11. At the solution, there are some unconnected
APs and WLCs. This is not evident in ﬁgure 2(a), because the corresponding
basic nodes are not isolated. This does not imply a waste of network resources,
since those cases are mainly located at mesh edges, and thus they allow future
growth. Also, over 50% APs have at most two connections, which implies a high
throughput per connection. Practically all WLCs set connections (97.8%). The
percentage of highest-rate links (11 Mbps) is close to 90%.

Improved IEEE 802.11 Deployment Algorithm

In [3], we proposed a centralized deployment algorithm based on a mixed integer
linear program. Now we present a new mesh planning model that adds explicit
counter-interference constraints, which is a mixed integer non-linear program.

Due to the complexity of this nonlinear model, our solver could not handle
it on a Pentium IV desktop. So we decided to break it to solve it iteratively, as
explained in section 4. In the next subsections we describe our model.
3.1

Sets and Constants

The main set BN contains N basic nodes bi , i = 0, . . . , N − 1. This set is divided
into two disjoint subsets, BNf (fully active basic nodes) and BNp (partially active basic nodes). Thus, BNp ∩BNf = ∅ and BN = BNp ∪BNf . Let dij indicate
the distance between bi and bj , kij the capacity of the corresponding link, and
ch api the channel of the AP in node bi . If it is partially active, ch api =0. If it
is fully active, ch api is the channel index of bi plus two. Consequently, ch api
is 0 or an integer in [3, 15].
3.2

Variables

Let i, j = 0, . . . , N − 1. The variables in the model are:
– c1ij , c2ij : Boolean variables. They equal 1 if WLCs #1 or #2 in bi are connected
to the AP in bj , respectively. They equal 0 otherwise.
– ch w1i , ch w2i : real variables indicating the channels that WLCs #1 and #2 in bi
acquire once connected. The optimization model ensures that they will take integer
values (see condition C6 and remark 1).
– δi : Boolean variable. If WLC #1 in bi is not connected, it equals 1 to set ch w1i
to dummy channel 18. Dummy channel 18 allows to set constraints (7)-(9) representing the inter-channel interference rule (remark 2).
– ei , fi : Boolean variables, to deﬁne linear constraints (8) and (9) that enforce the
inter-channel interference mitigation rule in a fully active node bi (remark 2).
– conex api : real variable, number of connections received by bi . Values in [0,4].
– capi : real variable, aggregated capacity of the connections received by basic node i.
– cap poni : real variable, average capacity of the connections bond to the AP in bi .
– degrki : real variable, degradation in bi due to links transmitting in channels with
mutual distance k.
– perc dki : real variable, indicating the percentage of capacity waste due to interference in basic node i by channels with mutual distance k.

Conditions

From mesh design speciﬁcations, we impose a series of conditions on model
variables. The optimization tools take advantage of these conditions to reduce
model size and execution time drastically. Let bi , bj be basic nodes in BN . Let
bp be a basic node in BNp . Then:
c1ip , c2ip = 0, since partially active nodes do not have APs.
c2pi = 0, since WLC #2 is disabled in partially active nodes.
kij = 0 ⇒ c1ij , c2ij = 0: no connections between nodes that are far apart.
c1ii , c2ii = 0, connections are forbidden within the same basic node.
| ch api − ch apj | < 3 ⇒ c1ij , c2ij = 0, due to the inter-channel interference mitigation rule. To understand this, suppose that | ch api − ch apj | < 3 and c1ij = 1
or c2ij = 1 . If so, one of the WLCs in bi is connected to the AP in bj . Consequently, at least one WLC transmitting in channel ch apj is physically adjacent to
bi , whose AP transmits in ch api . Thus, there are overlapping transmissions.
C6 ch w2p = conex app = capp = degrkp = cap ponp = 0 & perc dkp = 1: partially
active nodes have no AP (so no degradation) and no WLC #2.

Remark 1. Although ch w1i and ch w2i are declared as continuous real variables, their feasible values are integer due to constraints (5) and (6).
Remark 2: Constraints (7)-(9) are extremely important because they are equivalent to the reverse convex constraint | ch w2i − ch w1i | ≥ 3, which induces a
disjoint feasible region. Note that ei = 1 implies ch w2i − ch w1i ≥ 3 and inequality (9) holds trivially. On the other hand, ei = 0 implies ch w1i −ch w2i > 3
and inequality (8) holds trivially. Note the importance of dummy channel 18 for
WLC #1: if we represented the disconnected state of both WLCs by dummy
channel 0, constraints (8) and (9) could not be jointly feasible. The interested
reader can obtain more information on modeling disjoint regions in [6] (chapters
9 and 10).
Remark 3: Due the complexity of variable degr0i , bi ∈ BNf , we decided to
split it in three parts (12.1 to 12.3).
Part 12.1 considers the elements causing co-channel interference at the AP in
basic node i (less than 50 m away). The ﬁrst term considers interfering WLCs #1.
If WLC #1 in j joins the AP in i, factor (1−c1ji ) will be zero (the constraints avoid
interference). Note that 1 + 1000(ch api − ch w1j )10 will be 1 if ch api = ch w1j
(co-channel interference) and it grows exponentially with channel distance. As a
denominator, this expression penalizes the ﬁrst term, which is only signiﬁcant in
case of co-channel interference. Alternative (clearer) formulations were possible,
using the absolute value, sign or scalar functions, but the solver considers them
non-smooth or discontinuous functions. The second term counts interfering WLCs
#2. Finally, the third term simply counts interfering APs.
Part 12.2 considers the co-channel interference events aﬀecting WLC #1 in
basic node i (less than 50 m away). The ﬁrst term represents interfering APs, and
it is similar to the second term in (12.1). The second term considers interfering
WLCs #1. Note that, if both WLCs #1 in i and j join the same access point,
factor k (c1ik − c1jk )2 will be zero (the constraints avoid interference). However, if the WLCs join diﬀerent APs, the sum of their contributions multiplied by
1
will be two (which explains the 2 in
the common factor 2(1+1000(ch w1
10
j −ch w1i ) )

472

E. Costa-Montenegro et al.

the denominator of the second term). Finally, the third term counts interfering
WLCs #2. If a single WLC is connected, the denominators in the second and
third terms are so large that they do not contribute to interference.
Part 12.3 considers the co-channel interference events aﬀecting WLC #2 in
basic node i (less than 50 m away). The ﬁrst term counts interfering APs, like
the third term in (12.1). The second term counts interfering WLCs #1, like the
third term in (12.2). Finally, the third term counts interfering WLCs #2.

Numerical Tests

We tested the new model in the Vigo scenario in [3] (Figure 2(a)). The complexity
of the full MINLP (Mixed Integer Non-Linear Programming model) problem is
enormous. We tried to solve its GAMS 21.4 model. The solver did not succeed on
a Pentium IV at 2.4 GHz with 512 MB RAM. Even after GAMS compilation, the
size of the full MINLP is 2804 rows, 4840 columns, and 32874 non-zeroes. Thus, we
developed an iterative approach that considered the three interference distances
(0,1,2). First we solve the linear model in [3] to get an initial value for the second
step. In it, the model only considers co-channel interference (perc d0i contributions). Then, we freeze a subset of connections without inter-channel interference,
to deﬁne a new starting point for the third step, which considers interference between adjacent channels (distance one). The fourth step is deﬁned accordingly,
by considering distance-two interference. From the resulting point we start again
by only taking co-channel interference into account. The algorithm should stop
when most connections are ﬁxed, yielding as a ﬁnal result the intermediate solution with maximum objective function value (comprising co-channel and interchannel interferences at distances one and two). However, we obtained results of
practical interest with a single run of the ﬁrst two steps. The size of the resulting
compiled MINLP is 2524 rows, 4554 columns, and 25326 non-zeroes. Apparently
the size is the same, but we mainly eliminate non-linear constraints.
Table 1 shows objective function (14) values at algorithm termination. We
observe an improvement over [3] in all cases studied. The results are very similar when we freeze connections. This is possibly because we consider co-channel
interference in ﬁrst place and, since it is the most troublesome, the best connections are frozen early at the beginning. However, as we could expect beforehand, elapsed time drops drastically with the number of frozen connections.
Table 1 also shows interference events associated to the objective function values
(x − y − z: x distance 0 interference events, y distance 1 ones, z distance 2 ones).
We observe an improvement in all instances of the new mathematical model. In
some cases, we completely eliminate co-channel interference. In Figure 2(b) we
plot the resulting network for the instance with 25% frozen connections. It is
still fully connected. The average node degree is 2.74.

Conclusions

We have presented a new wireless mesh planning algorithm (a mixed integer nonlinear programming optimization model comprising interference constraints),
which we compare with the simpler deployment algorithms in [3]. Although
the new approach clearly produces better results in terms of interference minimization, it also allows us to validate the faster methods in [3]. Our algorithms
do not completely eliminate interference (there is a trade-oﬀ between interference and connectivity). However, according to our results, both co-channel and
inter-channel interference are extremely low at the solution.
