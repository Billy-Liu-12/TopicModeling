Abstract. IEEE 802.15.3 high-rate Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)
is a short range communication technology, in which devices (DEVs) of a piconet
communicate with a Piconet Coordinator (PNC). An extension of the communication area in WPAN via formation of a multi-piconet is one of the most challenging issues. Although a concept of multi-piconet has been defined in the IEEE
802.15.3 WPAN standard, a detailed formation mechanism of multi-piconet is
not presented. In this paper, we propose efficient multi-piconet formation algorithms, Piconet Coordinator To Device (PCTD) and Device To Piconet Coordinator (DTPC). We evaluate the performance of the algorithms via simulations.
The proposed algorithms are shown to extend the communication area with one
to three levels and to provide sufficient Channel Time Allocations (CTAs) for
subsidiary piconets in IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN.

1 Introduction
Recently, we have witnessed a noticeable increase of personal devices. The devices are
often required to interact wirelessly to make information accessible and to exchange
data without physical cables. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) can connect various personal devices within a Personal Operating Space (POS). IEEE 802.15.1
(Bluetooth) [1] and IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) [3] supports the transmission rate of less
than 1Mbps, which is not appropriate for high-rate WPAN applications. IEEE 802.15.3
[2] [4] is an emerging high-rate WPAN technology, which enables portable multimedia devices to connect and communicate wirelessly. IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN operates in
the unlicensed 2.4GHz ISM band with the data rate of up to 55Mbps and supports the
ad-hoc mode allowing a number of devices to communicate with one another in a peerto-peer mode. A piconet in IEEE 802.15.3 consists of one Piconet Coordinator (PNC)
and more than one device (DEV). In IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN, a multi-piconet can be
formed to extend a single piconet. A multi-piconet consists of a parent piconet and its
child piconets. The child PNC is a member of the parent piconet and also plays a role
of the PNC in the child piconet. A child piconet is dependent on the parent piconet [5].

In the Bluetooth specification, a piconet consists of one master device and up to
seven slave devices. A piconet can be extended in the form of a scatternet. A scatternet
is a collection of multiple piconets and each piconet includes bridge devices to interconnect piconets. The formation of scatternets is essential to break the limit of a small
piconet and allows interaction among Bluetooth piconets. There have been algorithms
for scatternet formation, i.e., a distributed scatternet formation protocol [6], a formation
mechanism to support device mobility [7], a Tree Scatternet Formation (TSF) algorithm
[8], and the scatternet-route structure [9].
In the IEEE 802.15.3 specification, efficient multi-piconet formation protocols and
Channel Time Allocation (CTA) mechanisms are not defined although basic frame
structure for the multi-piconet extension is defined. A multi-piconet can extend the
communication area of a single piconet. It is very important to form an interconnected
network combining separate piconets and to provide new services to users. Therefore, in
this paper, we propose an efficient multi-piconet formation scheme and evaluate its performance. In this paper, we present two multi-piconet formation algorithms, Piconet
Coordinator-To-Device (PCTD) and Device-To-Piconet Coordinator (DTPC). In the
PCTD multi-piconet formation algorithm, the formation of a multi-piconet is initiated
by a PNC. The PNC allocates private CTAs to DEVs and the DEVs create child piconets
to communicate one another in the allocated private CTAs. In the DTPC multi-piconet
formation algorithm, the formation of a multi-piconet is initiated by some DEVs of a
piconet and the PNC of the piconet allocates private CTAs to the DEVs. The initiating
DEVs report the remote scan information to the PNC. The DEVs then create child piconts and communicate one another in the allocated private CTAs. An efficient private
CTA allocation algorithm for PCTD and DTPC is also proposed. We conduct simulations to evaluate its performance. Simulation results validate the desired features of the
PCTD and DTPC algorithms.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the IEEE
802.15.3 High-rate WPAN. In Section 3, we describe our proposed PCTD and DTPC
multi-piconet formation algorithms. Section 4 provides the performance analysis of the
proposed algorithms. Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper.

2 IEEE 802.15.3 High-Rate WPAN Overview
In IEEE 802.15.3, a piconet consists of a PNC and more than one DEV. The PNC provides the basic timing for the piconet with beacons and it allows independent devices to
communicate one another. The standard utilizes the 2.4GHz ISM unlicensed frequency
band and two sets of channels are assigned for operation. The first set is the high-density
mode which allocates 4 channels while the second one is the IEEE 802.11b co-existence
mode which allocates 3 channels. Since the two outer channels of the sets overlap, there
are total of five channels.
In IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN, the channel time is divided into superframes, and each
superframe begins with a beacon. Fig. 1 illustrates the MAC superframe structure. A
superframe has three parts, i.e., beacon, Contention Access Period (CAP), and Channel
Time Allocation Period (CTAP). The beacon is used to carry control and channel time
allocation information to the entire piconet, and it is generated and broadcast by the

PNC. The CAP is used to exchange association request and response command, channel
time request and response command, and asynchronous data. Carrier Sense Multiple
Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is used for medium access control in the CAP.
The CTAP is composed of channel time allocations (CTAs) and management CTAs
(MCTAs), which makes TDMA-like medium access.
IEEE 802.15.3 WPAN allows a DEV to request the formation of a subsidiary piconet.
There are subsidiary piconets of two types. One is the child piconet and the other one
is the neighbor piconet. The original piconet is referred to as the parent piconet. The
neighbor piconet can not communicate with the parent piconet, but the child piconet
can communicate with the parent piconet. We call a multi-piconet as a larger piconet
consisting of a parent piconet and its child piconets. Fig. 2 shows a single piconet and a
multi-piconet. A parent piconet and its child piconets operate under the same channel.
A child PNC requests private CTAs to the parent PNC and the parent PNC allocates
private CTAs to the child PNC. A child piconet can then communicate in the private
CTA period.

3 Proposed Multi-piconet Formation Algorithms
In this section, we present our proposed two multi-piconet formation algorithms to extend limited piconet communication area. One is the PCTD multi-piconet formation
algorithm and the other one is the DTPC multi-piconet formation algorithm.
3.1 PCTD Multi-piconet Formation Algorithm
In this section, we describe the PCTD multi-piconet formation algorithm. In the PCTD
algorithm, a PNC starts to form a multi-piconet, empowers some DEVs to be child piconet PNCs and allocates private CTAs to the DEVs. The DEVs which are assigned the
private CTAs have the PNC capability. The PCTD multi-piconet formation procedure
is shown in Fig. 3.
If a parent PNC has its available capacity to distribute and there exist DEVs in the
current piconet, the PNC selects some DEVs as child PNCs by the child PNCs selection (CPS) algorithm shown in Fig. 4. Then, the PNC allocates private CTAs to the
selected DEVs by Eqs. (1)∼(5). The selected DEVs make piconets, i.e., child piconets.
Child piconets can now communicate in the allocated private CTAs. The mechanism of
selecting some DEVs as child PNCs works as follows. If the number of DEVs in a piconet is less than the minimum number of DEVs (min DEVs), we select all the DEVs.

Otherwise, we randomly select some DEVs among the DEVs with the probability of p
while providing the minimum number of DEVs.
Allocation of private CTAs is done as follows based on the basic capacity for level i,
Cicapacity and the allocation CTA remainder to one piconet for level i, RiCTA1 . To explain
the private CTA allocation algorithm for the PCTD multi-piconet formation algorithm,
we define the following notations:
–

–

–
–
–

TB : Beacon time
TCAP : Channel access period
TCTA : Channel time allocation
S : Maximum superframe size
N : Number of DEVs in the parent piconet
L : Number of levels
i = 1, 2, · · · , L
ni : Number of DEVs in level i,
i = 1, 2, · · · , L
mi : Number of child piconets in level i,
RiCTA1 : CTA allocation remainder to one piconet in level i,

C0capacity : Basic capacity for level 0 (parent piconet)
Cimax : Maximum capacity for level i,

i = 1, 2, · · · , L

The C0capacity consists of a beacon time and a CAP, and the basic CTAs for the parent
piconet DEVs and is computed as Eq. (1). We can calculate the basic capacity for level
i, Cicapacity by Eq. (2).
C0capacity = (TB + TCAP ) + (TCTA × N)
Cicapacity = (TB + TCAP ) × mi + (TCTA × ni ),

since mi child piconets require beacons and CAPs and ni DEVs in level i are assigned
TCTA . The remaining capacity has to be allocated for the parent piconet and its child
piconets. It the PCTD algorithm, the information on the next level is not known, the
CTA allocation remainder to one child piconet for level 1 is found as follows:
R1CTA1 =

S − C0capacity
m1 + 1

(3)

since S − C0capacity is the remaining capacity for level 1 and m1 is number of child piconets in level 1. Note that C0capacity does not contain n1 , which is the information on the
next level. The 1 in (m1 + 1) denotes the parent piconet. Similarly, we can find the CTA
allocation remainder in level i, RiCTA1 as follows.
RiCTA1 =

i-1
Ri-1
CTA1 × mi-1 − Ccapacity
,
mi + mi-1

i = 2, 3, · · · , L.

(4)

Thus, the private CTAs for each child piconet is equal to RiCTA1 in the PCTD multipiconet formation algorithm. The maximum capacity at level i, Cimax is given by
Cimax = RiCTA1 × mi ,

i = 1, 2, · · · , L

(5)

from the fact that each child piconet of level i is assigned RiCTA1 and there are mi child
piconets.
3.2 DTPC Multi-piconet Formation Algorithm
In this section, we describe the DTPC multi-piconet formation algorithm. In the DTPC
algorithm, a PNC requests remote scan to some selected DEVs. The selected DEVs
respond remote scan information to the PNC. The PNC then allocates private CTAs
to the DEVs. The DTPC multi-piconet formation procedure is shown in Fig. 5. First,
DEVs make their own piconets or join already formed piconets. The PNC of a piconet
requests remote scan to some selected DEVs and the selection is done by the CPS
algorithm, and the DEVs respond remote scan information with the near piconets to
the PNC. The DEVs then request private CTAs to the PNC to form child piconets. The
PNC allocates private CTAs to the requesting DEVs by Eqs. (1), (2), (6), (7), (8) and
the requesting DEVs make child piconets.

DEVs), (a) superframe allocation to child piconets (b) a multi-piconet topology

The basic capacity at level 0 (parent piconet) C0capacity and the basic capacity at level
i Cicapacity are the same as in Eqs. (1) and (2). The CTA allocation remainder at level 1,
R1CTA1 and the CTA allocation remainder at level i, RiCTA1 are calculated as follows:
R1CTA1 =

S − (C1capacity + C0capacity )
m1 + 1

RiCTA1 =

i
Ri-1
CTA1 × mi-1 − Ccapacity
,
mi + mi-1

(6)
i = 2, 3, · · · , L

(7)

since S - (C1capacity + C0capacity ) is the remaining capacity for level 1 and m1 is the number
of child piconets in level 1. The 1 in (m1 + 1) denotes the parent piconet. In the PCTD
algorithm the information on the next level is not known, we find RiCTA1 by Eqs. (3) and
(4). However, in the DTPC algorithm, we can know the information on the next level.
Therefore, R1CTA1 and RiCTA1 in DTPC algorithm is found as Eqs. (6) and (7).
The maximum capacity of level i, Cimax is given by
Cimax = RiCTA1 × mi + Cicapacity ,

i = 1, 2, · · · , L

(8)

from the fact that each child piconet of level i is assigned RiCTA1 and there are mi child
piconet, and Cicapacity is the basic capacity of level i.
Fig. 6 (b) shows a multi-piconet with level L=1 and the number of child piconets
m1 =2. Fig. 6 (a) shows the relationship of superframes for the topology. The superframe
of a parent piconet consists of the beacon, CAP, the communication period for the child
piconets, the local communication period for the parent piconet DEVs (a, b, c, d, e) and
the CTA allocation remainder R1CTA1 . The communication period of child piconet 1 is 4,
5, 6, 7 and the communication period of child piconet 2 is 1, 2, 3. The CTA allocation
remainder (R1CTA1 ) is required to reserve communications between the parent piconet
and child piconets, and to make child piconets of the next level.

4 Performance Evaluation
We evaluate the performance of the proposed two multi-piconet formation algorithms
via simulations. The simulation parameters are summarized in Table 1. The DEVs are
assumed to be located uniformly in a square area of 50m × 50m and 60m × 60m. And

the number of DEVs ranges from 10 to 150 in the area. The number of simulation runs
is 500. The length of a MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) is set to 2048 bytes, which
equals to the unit CTA size 1 . We analyze the performance of the PCDT and the DTPC
multi-piconet formation algorithm with respect to the number of formed multi-piconet
levels and the remaining capacity.
We then analyze the performance for random networks. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 present the
formed multi-piconet levels by the proposed algorithms. The PCTD algorithm is shown
to form multi-piconets with two to three levels, and the DTPC algorithm is shown to
form multi-piconets with one to two levels. The proposed algorithms form more levels
of a multi-piconet if the density of DEVs is high and the PCTD algorithm generates
more levels than the DTPC algorithm does. With the proposed algorithms, one can
extend the communication range two to three times. In particular, the communication
range of a formed multi-piconet by the PCTD algorithm is extended up to 50m assuming
the transmission range of a DEV is 10m. The PCTD algorithm exhibits higher efficiency
than the DTPC algorithm. We define the efficiency as the ratio between the allocated
capacity and the original total capacity. For example, in Fig. 7, if the number of DEVs
is 70, the PCDT algorithm is 130% better than the DTPC algorithm in terms of the
formation efficiency. And, if the number of DEVs is 110, the PCDT algorithm is 114 %
better than the DTPC algorithm.
We also analyze the remaining capacity at the final level. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 present
the remaining multi-piconet capacity as the number of DEVs varies. If the number
of DEVs increases, the remaining capacity decreases. Since the maximum superframe
size is 65.535ms, multi-piconet formation is possible up to level 3. Thus, the more
the number of DEVs, the higher the level of a multi-piconet becomes and the less the
remaining capacity of the last level becomes.
In the PCTD algorithm, if the capacity remains to make child piconets, it can directly
form new child piconets. However, in the DTPC algorithm, although the capacity remains to make child piconets, if the near piconet information as a result of remote scan
does not exist, it can not make new child piconets. Thus, the remaining capacity at the
last level in PCTD is smaller than that in DTPC as in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10. And the level
of the PCTD algorithm is higher than that of the DTPC algorithm.

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed the multi-piconet formation mechanisms with efficient
private CTA allocation schemes to extend the piconet communication area of IEEE
802.15.3 WPAN. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms via simulations. The results show the relationships of the level, the capacity and the number
of DEVs for multi-piconet formation. The PCTD algorithm is shown to form multipiconets with two to three levels, but the available capacity at the last level for child
piconets is limited. The DTPC algorithm can form multi-piconets with one to two levels, and the available capacity at the last level for child piconets is sufficient. The proposed algorithms are able to extend the communication area and to generate large-scale
WPAN service.
