Abstract
Batteries are highly complex electrochemical systems, with performance and safety governed by
coupled nonlinear electrochemical-electrical-thermal-mechanical processes over a range of
spatiotemporal scales. We describe a new, open source computational environment for battery
simulation known as VIBE - the Virtual Integrated Battery Environment. VIBE includes homogenized
and pseudo-2D electrochemistry models such as those by Newman-Tiedemann-Gu (NTG) and DoyleFuller-Newman (DFN, a.k.a. DualFoil) as well as a new advanced capability known as AMPERES
(Advanced MultiPhysics for Electrochemical and Renewable Energy Storage). AMPERES provides a
3D model for electrochemistry and full coupling with 3D electrical and thermal models on the same
grid. VIBE/AMPERES has been used to create three-dimensional battery cell and pack models that
explicitly simulate all the battery components (current collectors, electrodes, and separator). The
models are used to predict battery performance under normal operations and to study thermal and
mechanical response under adverse conditions.

1 Introduction
Most high-capacity rechargeable Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in mobile power applications
(vehicles, tools, phones, etc.) are based on intercalation reactions in which the mobile cations are
inserted into a host structure of electrodes. A typical Li-ion cell sandwich consists of positive (cathode
during discharge) and negative (anode during discharge) porous composite insertion electrodes, a
porous separator, negative (copper) and positive (aluminum) current collectors. The amount of energy
stored in a battery is directly proportional to the amount of active material that moves back and forth
between the electrodes. Battery power is limited by (1) the rate of diffusion of Li cations into cathode
or anode particles, (2) the electrical conductivity of cathode materials, and (3) the rate and distance of
ionic transport in the electrolyte and between the electrode particles. Any mismatch in the transport
across the scales can cause local temperature excursions and heterogeneities of the chemical species

that can result in catastrophic failure, such as explosion of this hazardous mix of fuel and oxidizer
(analogous to solid propellants).
Repeated charging and discharging degrades a Li-ion battery, affecting its chemical and structural
stability, capacity, voltage, power, and safety. Further improvements in the battery performance will
require addressing both materials science and chemistry challenges [1]. At the device level, scale-up
and integration of LIB unit cells into battery packs for vehicle powertrains [2] involve system power
and thermal management, abuse tolerance, and safety. Temperature imbalance can lead to shortened
life; and in the extreme case, temperatures in excess of 90oC can trigger exothermic chemical reactions
initiated by metastable SEI layers that can lead to cell thermal runaway [3-5]. Thermal excursion can
be especially severe when a cell is unintentionally shorted or otherwise abused.
Mechanical deformation [6] of batteries can trigger thermal runaway events by causing
rearrangement of electrode material, transfer of normal and shear stresses to the separator, and
eventually rupture of the separator and short circuits [7]. The electrical contacts and the subsequent
thermal runaway event will depend on the contact area, contact resistance, cell capacity, and the ability
of the current flow through the short to generate sufficient heat to cause the local temperature to rise
above ~90oC to trigger the thermal runaway events.
Given these complex options for chemistry and materials, it is important to have a simulation
capability and models that can predict performance, design and support experiments, optimize material
components and geometries, and estimate safety and durability in an integrated fashion [8].

processes occurring at different scales, along with corresponding characterization techniques.

Figure 1 shows the computational methods available for modeling and simulation of batteries,
electrochemical systems and materials at various length and time-scales, which can be summarized as:
x Electronic structure methods for modeling the atomistic structures and properties [8] that provide
fundamental insight into the atomistic and electronic processes governing energy and power
densities, as well as structural integrity;
x Classical force-field methods for the dynamics and structure of materials [9,10], which are used
to study defect formations and evolution;
1169

x Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) for modeling electrochemical reactions [11] in interfacial chemistry
x Phase field method [12-14] for modeling mesoscopic transport of ions and species in order to
understand the various resistances at the secondary particle level and optimize the chemistry;
x Coupled micro-macroscopic models to simulate spatiotemporally varying fields, such as ions and
species [15-17] at the cell/electrode levels to optimize safety and performance;
x Macroscopic and/or system-level models [18-29] for simulation of full cells and battery packs,
including life prediction and abuse scenarios.
To date, battery simulations have relied heavily on simplified unit cell models (e.g., 1-D and
pseudo-2D) and equivalent circuit models to account for cell performance variations [4,30,31] thereby
ignoring the underlying cell-to-cell electrochemical and thermal coupling. Following a description of
the underlying physics models for electrochemical systems in Section 2, we describe the new
simulation system VIBE - the Virtual Integrated Battery Environment [32]. While VIBE is targeted at
time and length-scales at the mesoscale and above, integration of components with a range of fidelity
provides researchers with a tool to accurately and efficiently explore problems ranging from the
effects of crystallographic texture in electrodes on cell performance to simulation of deformation and
internal short circuits.

2 Physics Models
In this section we describe models for the four major physical phenomena in Li-ion batteries: (a)
electro-chemistry, (b) electronic transport, (c) heat transport, and (d) mechanics. The electro-chemistry
model acting over the electro-active components provides heat source and electrical resistance but
requires temperature, geometry, stress, current, etc. from other components. The electrical component
acting over the entire device needs resistance and geometry but provides current, heat source, etc. The
thermal component acting over the entire domain needs heat sources, geometry but provides
temperature. The mechanical component takes temperature and provides deformed geometry/stress
etc. If the processes are separated in spatiotemporal scales, one can perform loose coupling and obtain
accurate solutions. However, in reality the scales overlap and one needs the ability to couple these
models to accurately predict response.

2.1 Electrochemistry
Several models applicable to redox-based energy storage systems have been developed with
different degrees of complexity and idealization. In the most general form, the mass and charge
conservation in 3D can be described with four differential equations applicable to host material
(subscript s) and electrolyte (subscript e) phases [15,33].

Effective solid and electrolyte transport properties, i.e., diffusivities ( Dseff

correspondingly) and conductivities ( V eff and k eff ) are described in terms of corresponding volume
fractions H s and H e as exponential relationships of a general form 4 eff H p 4 . Exponent p could be
taken as Bruggeman coefficient of 1.5 or used as an adjustable parameter to fit the discharge curve
data [34]. The diffusional conductivity N Deff is determined following the concentrated solution theory
[35] as

where f r is the mean molar activity coefficient of the electrolyte.
Equations 1 and 2 describe the mass and charge balances in electrode and electrolyte domains of a
redox cell in three dimensions. Several simplifications to this general model have been proposed. One
of the more well-known approaches is the pseudo-2D model developed by Doyle, Fuller, and Newman
[34-36]. The model, sometimes referred to as the DFN model, is based on porous electrode theory and
casts the equations of diffusion and charge transfer onto a simplified geometry. This geometry is
described by two coordinates – one through the electrode thickness and the other being radial
coordinate of an electrode particle idealized as a sphere. Transport through the electrolyte is modeled
by using the concentrated solution theory and the pore-wall flux of lithium ions across the electrodeelectrolyte interface is naturally set to zero in the separator region of the cell sandwich while at the
active material interface it follows the Butler-Volmer equation. With such a simplification, solid state
diffusion reduces to a 1D equation in the radial coordinate r of a particle with radius Rs

In order to reduce compute time, Eq. 6 can be solved either by the Duhamel superposition method
[35] or by using approximations for the surface lithium concentration that come from the diffusion
length formulas derived by C.Y. Wang et al. [15]. In the latter case the approximation for surface
concentration can be expressed as [37]

such a description, the initial surface concentration is equal to the average concentration of lithium in

The second category of electrochemical models is based on a description of cell behavior from
experimentally measured impedance characteristics. The model was developed by Newman,
Tiedemann [38] and Gu [39] and accordingly is commonly referred as the NTG model. The cell
current density (J) is linearly related to the cell potential (V) as
J

respectively. They are expressed as polynomial functions of state of charge variable T

(9)

The degree of polynomial (N) and the values of constants ai and bi are determined from the cell
discharge curves for a number of C-rates. When the cell potentials are plotted versus applied current
density, the cell voltages at zero current represent the OCPs of the cell and the slopes of potentials
represent the cell impedance 1 Y . Linear dependence of the latter on the current density is assumed,
resulting in Y being a function of state of charge only. While the NTG model allows rapid simulation
of large systems (modules or packs), it provides only overall cell response, and hence cannot be used
in situations where local variations in species or effects are of interest.
We are also developing an advanced electrochemistry capability known as AMPERES [5,32,40]
(Advanced MultiPhysics for Electrochemical and Renewable Energy Storage). AMPERES uses a
volume-averaged formulation that preserves the full 3D treatment of equations (1) and (2) and fully
couples electrochemistry with electrical and thermal models on the same grid.

2.2 Electronic transport
The conservation of charge within the cell (or module or pack) is expressed by the Laplace
equation:
V V

(10)

over the entire union of cell sandwich, current collector, and electrical interconnect component
domains. A non-singularity of electric field and conservation of charge is imposed on a single 3D
domain with appropriate boundary conditions applied to the current collector tabs. The values of
conductivity V of the cell sandwich are determined as a result of the solution of the corresponding
electrochemical set of equations.

where U is the density, C p is the specific heat capacity, k ^k x , k y , k z ` is the anisotropic thermal
conductivity, and T is local temperature. In Li-ion battery cells, thermal properties are highly
anisotropic due to their layered cell structure. Equation 11 is solved for the entire cell, module, and
pack. In electrical interconnect components and current collectors heat source is represented by a
simple ohmic heating model. The heat generation model within the electrochemical dual-electrode
cells was derived by Bernardi et al. [41]. In its simplified form commonly employed in battery
simulations, the heat generation consists of irreversible energy loss due to cell polarization, reversible
entropy change due to particular half-cell reaction and ohmic heating within cell sandwich.

where the summation in general occurs over all reactions j 1...M which in case of Li-ion

on the cell level and the local solid and electrolyte potentials are not known. Thus in this case Eq. 12 is
applied in its integral form as

2.4 Mechanics
We are primarily concerned with mechanical response of the batteries to external loading, which is
one of the major safety concerns. Large deformations of the battery pack that may arise due to crash
loads can create internal short circuit that may result in thermal runaway.
Mechanical behavior of the foil materials can be described by the elastic-plastic formulation:

composite coatings on the current collectors is not well understood, so effective properties of the
composite electrode layers are estimated by experiments on cells and inverse modeling to match
experimental response.

3 Virtual Integrated Battery Environment (VIBE)
VIBE [32] is a new computational environment designed to allow both traditional electrochemistry
models such as NTG and DFN and advanced models such as AMPERES to be coupled with thermal
and electrical in a fully three-dimensional system so as to more realistically investigate the behavior of
complex electrochemical systems. Figure 2 shows the UML package diagram for VIBE, and indicates
models currently available. Note that the Python-based Open Architecture Software (OAS) framework
is used when loosely coupling components, but tight coupling is also possible within AMPERES,
which leverages nonlinear solvers and preconditioners in Trilinos [42], PETSc [43], and SunDials
[44]. Two of the combinations of physics models that have been used in analysis include DualFoil +
1174

Safer Batteries Through Coupled Multiscale Modeling

AMPERES-TH and AMPERES-EC + AMPERES-E + AMPERES-TH. Each combination is
controlled by a coupled driver routine, and optimization or parametric studies can be performed using
the DAKOTA toolkit [45].
Mechanics is a recent addition to VIBE, necessary for analysis of crush scenarios such as vehicle
crashes. This is currently a one-way coupling. A mechanics simulation is performed until separator
failure and an internal short circuit is detected. A coupled electrochemistry-electrical-thermal
simulation is then performed on the deformed mesh to determine whether thermal runaway occurs.

4 Results and Next Steps
To demonstrate the unique capability of VIBE/AMPERES to simulate a scenario requiring threedimensional effects, we repeat an earlier simulation [32] with an internal short circuit. Lithium
manganese oxide was used as an active cathode material with petroleum derived carbon coke as the
anode. The electrolyte consisted of LiPF6 salt in non-aqueous mixture of ethylene carbonate (EC) and
dimethyl carbonate (DMC) in a poly(vinyl difluoride)-hexafluoropropylene (PVDF-HFP) polymer
matrix. Table 1 gives the physical parameters used in the simulation, and Figure 3 shows the solid
phase potential for an unrolled cell as described in [37], using a contact resistance converted to a
conductance of 10-3 S/cm. Since this is a single unrolled cell it is a small problem, with only about
70,000 degrees of freedom, so it requires only a few minutes to complete. This demonstrates that
AMPERES is robust enough to handle the high discharge rates (100C or more) needed for these
scenarios. Note that AMPERES can be used for arbitrarily complex geometries (limited only by ability
to generate meshes) and for other chemistries simply by changing model parameters.
Although we have not presented deformation results here, those simulations are underway.
However, there are significant challenges with respect to the mechanics of electrodes when crushed
and for separator failure models. Both simulations and experiments are under way to develop and
validate models for those phenomena.
