Abstract. We propose a new computational method of input selection for stock
market forecasting with neural networks. The method results from synthetically
considering the special feature of input variables of neural networks and the
special feature of stock market time series. We conduct the experiments to
compare the prediction performance of the neural networks based on the different input variables by using the different input selection methods for forecasting
S&P 500 and NIKKEI 225. The experiment results show that our method performs best in selecting the appropriate input variables of neural networks.

1 Introduction
The time series forecasting in stock market is characterized by data intensity, noise,
non-stationary, unstructured nature, high degree of uncertainty, and hidden relationships[1]. Neural networks (NN) are particularly well suited to finding accurate solutions in an environment characterized by complex, noisy, irrelevant or partial information[2]. Some researchers have conducted work on the stock market time series
forecasting by using past value or transformations of them as input variables of neural
networks[3]. Neeraj et al studied the efficacy of neural networks in modeling the
Bombay Stock Exchange SENSEX weekly closing values. They develop the two
neural networks, which are denoted as NN1 and NN2. NN1 takes as its inputs the
weekly closing value, 52-week Moving Average of the weekly closing SENSEX
values, 5-week Moving Average of the same, and the 10-week Oscillator for the past
200 weeks. NN2 takes as its inputs the weekly closing value, 52-week Moving Average of the weekly closing SENSEX values, 5-week Moving Average of the same, and
the 5-week volatility for the past 200 weeks[4]. Yim predicted Brazilian daily index
returns. He mapped lagged returns to current returns by using the following three
neural networks with backpropagation algorithm. The first neural network has nine
lagged returns in the input layer (lags 1 to 9). The second one has only four neurons in
the input layer (lags 1, 2, 5 and 9). The third one consists of two neurons (lags 1 and
9) in the input layer. The third neural network produced the best overall results[5]. Yu
used the six input which use past prices or transformations of them. The inputs to the

neural networks are as follows: (1) the basis lagged six periods, (2) the RSI differential of the futures price and the index, (3) the MACD differential of the futures price
and the index, (4) the change of the basis, (5) the RSI of the basis, (6) the MACD of
the basis. His results for out of sample show that the neural network forecast performance is better than that of the ARIMA model[6]. Qi and Zhang use Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as well as several
extensions to select input of neural networks for S&P 500 index. The results indicate
that the information-based in-sample model selection criteria are not able to provide a
reliable guide to out-of-sample performance and there is no apparent connection between in-sample model fit and out-of-sample forecasting performance[7]. Chaos
analysis is a good method to analyze nonlinear dynamics in the time series. Nonlinear
dynamics and chaos theory can provide information about the lag structures for the
design of forecasting models using neural networks. Chaos analysis criterion (CAC)
was applied to determine the lag structure for the input of neural networks based on
the embedding dimensions of stock index[8, 9]. However, CAC neglect the special
feature of input variables of neural networks that the input variables should not be
much correlated.
Our contribution of the paper is to propose a new computational method of selecting input variables for stock market forecasting with neural networks. The computational method results from the synthetically considering the special feature of input
variables of neural networks and the special feature of stock market time series. The
remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the new computational method. In Section 3, we conduct the experiments to compare the prediction
performance of the neural networks based on the different input variables by using the
different input selection methods. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 4.

2 Our Input Selection Method
In fact, neural networks for time series forecasting is a kind of nonlinear autoregressive (AR) model as follows:

yË† t + n = F ( y t âˆ’ s1 , y t âˆ’ s2 , â€¦, y t âˆ’ si )

(1)

where yË† t + n is the output of the neural network, namely the predicted value when we
make a prediction of n periods ahead from the present period t ; yt âˆ’ s1 , y t âˆ’ s2 , â€¦,

y t âˆ’ si are the inputs of the neural network, namely the actual value at the corresponding period; si is the lag period from the present period t ; F (â€¢) is a nonlinear function determined by the neural networks. The problem is to select the appropriate input
variables ( y t âˆ’ s1 , y t âˆ’ s2 , â€¦, y t âˆ’ si ) of neural networks.
Usually, the rule of input variable selection is that the input variables should be as
predictive as possible. As is well known, autocorrelation coefficient is a popular indicator to measure the correlation of time series. The autocorrelation coefficient of a
series { y t } at lag k is estimated in the following way:

W. Huang et al.

rk =

âˆ‘ ( y t âˆ’ y )( y t âˆ’ k âˆ’ y )

t = k +1

(2)

âˆ‘ ( yt âˆ’ y )

t =1

where y is the sample mean of { y t } . Table 1 shows the autocorrelation coefficients
of daily observations of S&P 500 and NIKKEI 225. It indicates that the absolute
value of autocorrelation coefficients of stock index prices become smaller when the
lag period becomes longer.

The special feature of input variables of neural networks is that the input variables
should not be much correlated, because the correlated input variables may degrade the
prediction performance by interacting with each other as well as other elements and
producing a biased effect[10]. Actually, the correlated input variables contribute the
similar information for the output variable of neural networks. Therefore, the neural
networks get confused and do not know to use which one. In other words, the neural
networks may alternate back and forth, and over-fit.
There is a dilemma to select the input variables of neural networks. In order to let
the input variables correlated to the output variable, we should choose the input variable with less lags like { y t , y t âˆ’1 , y t âˆ’ 2 , y t âˆ’3 , â€¦}. However, the above input variables
are too correlated to each other. In order to get a trade-off of the two conflicted requirements of input variables selection, we propose a new computational method of
input selection for stock market forecasting with neural networks (see Figure 1). It is a

3 Experiments Analysis
In order to demonstrate our method, we conduct the experiments to compare the prediction performance of the neural networks based on the different input variables by
using the different input selection methods.
3.1 Neural Network Models

In order to reduce the degrees of freedom in the developed neural network models and
to maintain consistency with previous research efforts, we focus on the following two
popular feedforward neural network models: (1)3-layers back-propagation networks
with adaptive learning rate and momentum(BPN); (2)radial basis function networks(RBFN).

3.2 NaÃ¯ve Prediction Hypothesis

The naÃ¯ve prediction hypothesis asserts today's stock price as the best estimate of
tomorrow's price. It can expressed as follows:
yË† t +1 = y t

(3)

where yË† t +1 is the predicted value of the next period; y t is the actual values of current
period.
3.3 Performance Measure

Normalized mean squared error (NMSE) is used to evaluate the prediction performance of neural networks. Given a set P comprising pairs of the actual value x k and
predicted value xË† k , the NMSE can be defined as follows:
NMSE =

2
âˆ‘ kâˆˆP ( x k âˆ’ xË† k )
2
âˆ‘ kâˆˆP ( x k âˆ’ x k )

(4)

where x k is the mean of actual values.
3.4 Data Preparation

We obtain the daily observation of two stock indices, S&P500 and NIKKEI225, from
the finance section of Yahoo. The entire data set covers the period from January 2001
to November 2005. The data sets are divided into two periods: the first period covers
from January 2001 to December 2004 while the second period is from January 2005
to November 2005. The first period is used to estimate the models parameters. We
select the appropriate size of training set by using the method in[11]. The second
period is reserved for out-of-sample evaluation and comparison.
3.5 Results

Table 2 shows the prediction performances of the naÃ¯ve prediction, which are used as
benchmarks of prediction performance of S&P500 and NIKKEI225. In order to investigate the effects of the maximum lag period size on the prediction performance of
neural networks, we let the maximum lag period N = 8,10,12 respectively for one
forecasting period ahead, namely n = 1. Table 3 shows the input variables of the
neural networks for forecasting S&P 500 and NIKKEI 225 by using our method,
Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and Chaos
analysis criterion (CAC).

Table 4 shows the prediction performance of 3-layers back-propagation networks
with adaptive learning rate and momentum(BPN) with the different input variables
determined by using the different input selection methods. Table 5 shows the prediction performance of radial basis function networks(RBFN) with the different input
variables determined by using the different input selection methods. The value of
NMSE by using our method is the smallest among the different input selection methods, when the initial parameter maximum lag period N = 8,10,12 respectively. It
shows that our method performs best in selecting the appropriate input variable of the
neural networks for forecasting S&P 500 and NIKKEI 225. Because our method balance the two conflicted need of input variables of neural networks: (1) the input variables should be more correlated to the output variable; (2) the input variables should
be less correlated to each other. The chaos analysis criterion (CAC) performs worst in
selecting the appropriate input variable of the neural networks for forecasting S&P
500 and NIKKEI 225. Compared with the naÃ¯ve prediction, the neural networks perform better except when using the input variable determined by the chaos analysis
criterion (CAC). Because CAC doesnâ€™t consider the special feature of input variable
of neural networks, and the selected input variables are too correlated to each other.
Our method doesnâ€™t require any assumptions, completely independent of particular
class of model. The method makes full uses of information among sample observations even if the underlying relationships are unknown or hard to describe. Therefore,
it is a very practical way to select the input variable of the neural networks when the
financial time series is hard to model.
