Abstract. This paper presents a two-dimensional numerical simulation of fluid
flow around a couple of identical circular cylinders aligned, respectively, along
and orthogonal to the main-flow direction, at several distances. A latticeBoltzmann method (LB) is used. The forces resulting from fluid-solid
interaction are calculated by considering the momentum exchanged between the
fluid and the solid surfaces. Bluff body wake interference and its effect on drag
and lift forces is studied in detail. The drag and the lift coefficients are obtained
and compared with others existing results. A transition regime is obtained when
the cylinders are aligned orthogonal to the main flow direction and separated by
distances smaller than about 2D.

Introduction

The study of the flow pattern around bluff bodies is a subject of permanent interest
and has, for a long time, attracted the attention of researchers, considering its
increasing complexity with the Reynolds number, Re, and its great technological
importance in engineering design.
For a single cylinder, fluid flow induces the appearance of vortex just behind any
solid obstacle that is placed against it. When Re is greater than ~45, this flow pattern
becomes mechanically unstable and vortices are shed off by the main flow, forming
the von Karmann vortex street, [1].
In this way, after vortex street formation, the obstacle is subjected to a fluctuating
drag that induces vibrations with frequencies that are related to the frequencies these
vortices are formed and released to the wake.
A Fourier analysis of the lifting force shows that the vortex is formed with a single
frequency when Re is near its mechanical stability limit (Re~45). When Re increases
far from this limit, flow pattern changes to a transition pattern, [2,3], and its vortex
formation frequency spectrum becomes broader.
Present paper deals with the vortex street interference process and its dynamic
effects on the forces that two solid objects are subjected when placed at near
locations, against the flow, [4-6].
Vortex street interference is a very interesting subject of growing scientific interest,
since interference can lower the Reynolds limits to transition. In addition, flow
interference between two circular cylinders is important in several applications. In

petroleum engineering, interference can raise damage in bundles of risers in the
offshore platforms of oil exploitation.
We restrict ourselves to two-dimensional incompressible flow around cylindrical
shaped obstacles.
Flow is simulated using lattice Boltzmann equation, with a BGK, single relaxation
time, collision model, [7-10].
The use of lattice-Boltzmann as a working-method in this class of problems has
some important, well-known, advantages: i) programming is very easy and ii) the
method is intrinsically parallel. Nevertheless, it appears that the most important
advantage of the LB method with respect to classical CFD methods is related to the
needless of velocity field numerical derivatives in calculating the drag force. In fact,
due to its mesoscale nature, drag force can be directly calculated in LB methods by,
simply, considering the momentum exchanged between the lattice-particles and the
solid body.

Lattice-Boltzmann Simulation

As usually, let ci indicate the lattice unitary-velocity along direction i of a D2Q9
lattice, i.e., a two dimensional 9-velocity lattice, which unitary cell is a square formed
by the four, ci = 1, principal directions, by the four, ci = 2 , diagonals and by one
ci = 0 . Let N i ( X ,T ) designate the particles distribution in the i-direction of site X ,

at time T. Lattice-Boltzmann equation with BGK collision model is written as
N i ( X + c i ,T + 1 ) − N i ( X ,T ) =

N ieq ( X ,T ) − N i ( X ,T )

τ

,

where τ is a relaxation time, related to fluid kinematics viscosity and N ieq ( X ,T ) is an
equilibrium distribution that can be considered as a D2Q9 gaussian quadrature of the
Maxwell-Boltzmann continuous distribution function, [8],and is given by
N ieq = wi ρ { 1 +

(ci .u ) (ci .u ) 2 u 2

− 2
cs2
2cs4

where is wi = 1/ 9 for the principal directions, i = 1,2,3,4; wi = 1 / 36 for the
diagonals, i = 5,6,7,8; and w0 = 4 / 9 . cs2 = 1 / 3 is the square of LB sound velocity in
a D2Q9 lattice.
At each simulation time-step, velocity field u( X ,T ) and pressure P( X ,T ) are,
respectively, calculated by using

Boundary conditions were taken as the following: u x = U , u y = 0 at the left (x=0)
and the right ( x = Lx ) and at the upper and lower boundaries of the simulation
domain. U is the main-flow velocity.

is the LB kinematic viscosity in a

D2Q9 lattice.
Flow adherence at solid boundaries is simulated by using the bounce-back
condition, i.e., by requiring that N i ( X b ,T +1 ) = N −i ( X b ,T ) for all the b-sites at the
fluid domain closest to the solid-boundary sites and for all the directions i, related to
these sites, pointing outward the solid surface.
Considering that discrete circles have a discreteness-produced rough surface, the
use of bounce-back conditions at this rough surface, requires the enlargement of the
simulation domain until simulation results become insensible to discreteness effects.
This is an important question in CFD simulation, considering computational costs.
Generalized coordinates are used in association with finite-volumes method, but mesh
generation is computationally expensive and the method is highly subjected to
stability problems.
Since He and Luo, [4], has demonstrated that LB equation is a special discrete
form of the Boltzmann continuous equation, some effort has been undertaken in LB
simulation, for the implementation of non-regular lattices and/or varying-size mesh,
[11]. For varying size mesh, interpolation is required and interpolation has been
shown to increase stability problems, [12].
The strong development of computers is, presently, pulling-back some classical
CFD practitioners to Cartesian mesh, with larger resolution. An important
contribution in this field was given by Lima e Silva et al. (2002), [4], with the
immersed boundary method.
In this sense, present work is limited to the regular D2Q9 lattice.
The total force that the flow exerts on a solid body which boundary surface is Γ is
calculated by

F=
Γ

i

[N

−i

]

( X Γ ,T + ) + N i ( X Γ ,T − ) ci ,

(5)

i.e., by calculating the momentum variation of each site X Γ in the fluid domain
contiguous to the boundary surface, considering the particles N i ( X Γ ,T − ) in the
i=direction pointing to the surface, before propagation, that were bounced back to the
direction -i, after propagation, N −i ( X Γ ,T + ) .
The drag and the lift forces are, respectively, the x and y components of F , when x
is the main-flow direction.

When the flow pattern is symmetric with respect to the main-flow direction x, the
lift-force is zero. This is what happens with immersed cylinders at very small
Reynolds number. When Re is increased, vortex shedding behind the cylinder
produces an oscillating lift with the same frequency of the vortices that are formed.
An average drag coefficient C D was calculated as the time average of

Lift coefficient C L is calculated in the same way, but using the main-flow
orthogonal component Fy . C L is also a function of time and, frequently, C L = 0 .

the lift, calculated as,

Results

3.1 Single Circular Cylinder
Preliminary tests were performed for the single cylinder problem, with the purpose of
validating the present LB simulation sheme, in what it concerns drag force (Eq. 5) and
Strouhal number calculations. Diferent lattice sizes were tested from 334x200 to
3000x1800 lattice units, considering a cylinder with 40 lattice units along ist
diameter. A 1000x600 lattice was considered to give enough accurate results.
Comparisons with some others authors, [13-18], are presented in Fig. 1 showing a
very good agreement for both the drag and the Strouhal number.

between the centers of the two cylinders was varied from 1.5D to 4D

Fig. 3 shows the vorticity patterns for several L. When L is smaller than ~3.5D,
vortices that were formed in the intermediate region between the upstream and the
downstream cylinders are not shed off until those vortices reach the downstream
cylinder. A low pressure are formed between the two cylinders. Therefore, this low
pressure region induces a negative drag on the downstream cylinder. This cylinder is
attracted to the upstream body, [5,6].
This can be better seen in Fig. 4, which presents the simulation results for the drag,
C D and lift, C Lrms , coefficients, for the two cylinders. Drag results were compared
with Meneghini et al.'s results, [5], who have used a fractional step method.
Agreement between the two methods can be considered as good, although Meneghini
and co-authors did not report any data for L = 2.5D or 3.5D. Although results are very
dissimilar for L = 4.0D, there is a good agreement between both works for the
transition point, when the drag becomes positive for the downstream cylinder. For the
upstream cylinder, drag forces appear to be overestimated in Lattice Boltzmann
simulations that have been performed with 1320x600 lattice.

appears, showing a growing frequency at St = 0,13 (which is the unique dominant
frequency for L = 3D).

Fig. 7 shows the vorticity patterns for several L. When L is smaller than ~3 D, the
wake interference becomes increasingly important and the two cylinders have
opposed lifts that try to separate one from another. This can be seen in Fig. 8, which
presents the simulation results for the drag, C D and lift, C L , coefficients, for the two
cylinders. Drag and lift results were compared with Meneghini et al., [5]. Agreement
between the two methods can be considered as very good, for the lift coefficient,
although present LB simulation has overestimated the drag coefficient with respect to
Meneghini and co-authors' results. For this Lattice Boltzmann simulation, a single
1200x820 lattice size was used and Lattice Boltzmann results have to be considered
as preliminary.
Figs. 4 and 8 show some overestimation of LB simulation for the drag force when
compared to Meneghini et al.’s results, [5], indicating that more extensive LB
simulation is still to be carried out, for clarifying this disagreement. Boundary
conditions can be, further, improved beyond the presently used bounce-back
condition to reduce discretization effects in the geometrical representation of the
circular cylinder surface.

Fig. 9 shows a time-sequence of vorticity images showing when wake interference
begins and flow pattern changes to a transition pattern. This is clearly seen in Fig. 10,
where the Strouhal spectrum for L=3D and for L=1.5D, are compared. When the two
cylinders are located at a distance L larger than 2D, vortices are formed with a single
dominant frequency. When these bodies are neared, flow interference enlarges the
spectrum frequency with which the vortices are formed and released to the main flow,
driving a transition regime to turbulence. The frequency spectrum that was obtained
for the case L=2D was similar to the one for L=1.5D, but less broad and with a more
clear predominance of St = 0.21.

Conclusions

In present paper, a lattice-Boltzmann method was used for studying the flow
interference, when two solid bodies are immersed in the flow, at near locations.
Simulation results were compared with the results obtained with the Fraction Step
Method.
The results for a single circular cylinder placed in the flow sugests that this method
can be applied to simulate complex flows in the range of Re from 50 to 200.
Main conclusion are: i) when the cylinders are aligned along the main-flow
direction, vortices are formed with a single frequency for Re ≤ 200; ii) transition to
turbulence appear in two-dimensional flow, when the cylinders are aligned orthogonal
to the main flow direction and separated by distances smaller than ~2D.
It is well known, [2,3], that for a single circular cylinder, three-dimensional
vortices appear above Re=200. This is the main reason, present work was limited to
Re=200. Nevertheless, flow interference produced by two or more solid bodies can
give rise to the development of three-dimensional vortices at lower Reynolds number.
In this way, further work must consider three-dimensional LB simulations.
