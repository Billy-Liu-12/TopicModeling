patients have an increased BMI value, the following conditions will place them at greater risk of
coronary disease and other serious conditions: Fasting blood sugar over 100 mg/dl; Fasting triglyceride
(TG) level over 150 mg/dl; Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) over 130/85 mmHg; fasting high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level less than 40 mg/dl (men) or 50 mg/dl (women); fasting low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level over 100 mg/dl; homeostatic model assessment–insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) over 2.5; smoking, family history and lack of physical activity (NHLBI, n.d.; Chaudhari,
Usmani, Baghel, & Jain, 2012; van der Sande, et al., 2001). It is evident that all of the risk factors are
changeable, apart from family history. Resultantly, many of these risk factors can be reduced by
changing people’s lifestyles. We can control the increase in BMI levels in society by controlling the
changeable risk factors with various lifestyle changes. The aim of this study was to determine the most
effective ANFIS model by applying the minimum number of variables, which could define the
association between the best-fitting and biologically reasonable dependent variable (BMI and the
independent variables by determining the associated risk factors in the study population.

2 Related Studies
(Kazemipoor, Hajifaraji, Shamshirband, Petković, & Kiah, 2015) used Carum carvi herbal
traditional medicine as a clinical dietary intervention method on women who are obese. They examined
and proved the developed ANFIS model’s estimation accuracy and acceptability by comparing the
results of the Support Vector Regression mode based on the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and
coefficient of determination (R2) outcomes. A novel estimation model was established and examined
by (Sharifi, Vosolipour, Sh, & Teshnehlab, 2008) which was called ANFIS-GMDH, in order to predict
diabetes mellitus based on the this model. This new method consisted of two main parts, namely the
new group method of data handling (GMDH) and the ANFIS structure. The proposed system was used
to forecast diabetes mellitus. Backpropagation and ANFIS were chosen as the training methods for the
network. The experimental results of the study revealed that the developed method could diagnose the
diabetes diseases accurately and fast. Another similar study (Übeyli, 2010) used ANFIS to diagnose
diabetes based on eight independent variables as inputs. The developed model classified and diagnosed
with a 98.14% accuracy rate. Additionally, (Kalaiselvi & Nasira, 2014) emphasised that to diagnose and
classify both diabetes and cancer, ANFIS is an accurate and efficient method. A Fast Adaptive NeuroFuzzy Inference System (FANFIS) was developed by (AnandaKumar & Punithavalli, 2011) as a novel
method in order to classify and diagnose cancer based on the Modified Levenberg-Marquardt learning
algorithm. The novel method provided faster and accurate classification then the conventional ANFIS.
The image processing technique based on bounding box and thresholding methods with ANFIS were
used in this model. (Khameneh, Arabalibeik, Salehian, & Setayeshi, 2012) study was conducted to
diagnose abnormalities in red blood cells by using microscopic blood cell images. The developed ANFIS
classified normal and abnormal type of blood red cells with 96.6% accuracy. Another similar
classification (abnormal and normal) study was presented by (Sengur, 2008) to determine and classify
heart Doppler sound abnormalities based on ANFIS and Linear Discriminant Analysis. The developed
model sensitivity was 95.9% and the specificity was 94%. (Uçar, Karahoca, & Karahoca, 2013)
developed ANFIS based on Sugeno-type in order to diagnose and make decisions in the case of
suspected mycobacterium tuberculosis accurately and rapidly (less than 45 days clinical conditions).
The experimental results revealed that the developed system had 97% accuracy.
The literature review has shown that recent studies into BMI estimation have not considered the other
risk factors and Neuro-Fuzzy applications. Based on this deficiency in the literature, the present study
will focus on the correlated risk factors in order to estimate BMI values.

3 Materials and Methods
Data collection and statistical analysis were used for preparing the input (independent, predictor or
explanatory) variables; ANFIS structure and implementation are all discussed in this section. Figure 1
shows the block diagram of the current study.

Figure 1: The study block diagram

3.1 Data Collection
As seen in Figure 1, the crisp data from Near East University Hospital was used in this study. The
data has been collected and obtained from the health check-up results of 324 adult individuals (163
males and 161 females) who had been constantly treated by the Internal Medicine Department of Near
East University. BMI, WC (Waist circumference) in cm, SBP (Systolic blood pressure), DBP (Diastolic
blood pressure), FG (Fasting glucose), TCL (Total cholesterol level), HDL (High-density lipoprotein),
LDL (Low density lipoprotein), TG (Triglycerides), UA (uric acid), hs-CRP (High sensitivity C-reactive
protein), age and HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment–Insulin Resistance) were evaluated for
all adults. All the variables were considered as continuous variables.

3.2 ANFIS Training and Testing
When modelling the neural networks in order to obtain accurate results, the first step is determining
the testing data and training data sets (Tabrizi & Cavus, 2016). In this study the randomly selected
training data set consists of 70% of all the data and the remaining data is used for the testing phase. The
Fuzzy c-Mean (FCM) clustering technique was applied after taking the correlated explanatory variables
with the response variable BMI. Therefore, the developed model Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) structure
was generated in MATLAB® based on the Gaussian membership function “Gengis3”. The trial and
error method was used to find the numbers of clusters. Five clusters provided better results with a lower
error rate. The generated FIS is capable of establishing the rules and converting crispy input data to the
appropriate fuzzy input variables. In order to establish the ANFIS, the generated FIS was applied in the
next step. It should be mentioned that the fuzzy rules number is equal to the membership functions (5
MF) number.

4 Implementation
All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS ver.20 (SPSS for Windows, Chicago, IL, USA).
The normality of distribution was tested by Shapiro-Wilk test. Since no variable was normally
distributed in the study, descriptive statistics of the clinical characteristics were expressed as a median.
The Mann-Whitney U test was used for group comparisons. A p value of less than 0.01 was considered

statistically significant. Using Spearman’s correlation (rs), each of the independent variables was tested
individually for association with the dependent variable. The MATLAB ® R2016a Neuro-Fuzzy
Designer toolbox was applied to develop the ANFIS model for estimating the BMI. Table 1 describes
the developed model details.

5 Results and Performance Evaluation
Since the risk factors HDL and WC have different limits for men and women, separate models for
BMI estimation were developed for the two genders. Table 2 represents the descriptive statistics of the
clinical characteristics and correlation coefficients between the BMI and each of the independent
variables of the male and female adults. The median of all the clinical characteristics (except LDL and
TCL) was statistically significantly different between men and women. Since a correlation, less than 0.5
is generally described as weak, all explanatory variables except LDL TCL with a correlation with BMI
of less than 0.5 were not included in the ANFIS model. Therefore, WC, FG, HDL, TG, and HOMA-IR
were included for the ANFIS model, since they have an acceptable correlation with BMI. The details of
the ANFIS model are described in Table 3. The proposed model was performed for both gender groups
by using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) methods. In the formula below, 𝒚𝒚𝟏𝟏 𝒕𝒕𝒕𝒕 𝒏𝒏 are observed

Table 3: Comparisons result of the sample adult individuals BMI value and the model predicted value

For instance, the ANFIS model predicts a BMI value of 30.50 for a female individual having HOMAIR(2.93), WC(102), TG(123), FG(118) and HDL(37). Moreover, the developed model predicts a BMI
value of 37 for a male individual having HOMA-IR (4.20), WC(119), TG(195), FG(126) and HDL(36).
The comparison results of the estimated model with observed BMI for females (30.90) and for males
(37.20) revealed that the implemented models provide highly reliable results for estimating the BMI.

6 Conclusion
A low RMSE value between the observed and estimated values demonstrates that this model is
biologically acceptable and suggests that this method for predicting BMI based on five factors that have
an acceptably strong correlation with BMI values, is effective. If we control the changeable risk factors
in our model with various lifestyle modifications, the authors expect that this will have an impact on the
increase in BMI levels, which means that obesity may be prevented. This is achieved by evaluating the
results of all input variables together. Furthermore, the ANFIS model can be used for appropriately
modelling uncertain fuzzy variables and, at the same time, the implementation of this model is easier
than other neural models. These are the principal reasons why the ANFIS model was selected for this
study.
