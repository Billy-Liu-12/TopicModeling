Abstract
A Small-World network is one of complex networks which could be used for analysis of human networks in SNS (social
networking service) and an eﬃcient design of logistics, etc. We have developed a new Small-World network (called n-Star
network) inspired by Ant-Colony Optimization (ACO), and applied it to reorganizing a next generation airline network. In this
study, the network is extended to several hierarchical architectures that will be more useful for real-world applications. Such
architectures include six kinds of hierarchical networks. We analyze the features of the hierarchical networks using several
network parameters. As one of real-world applications, we propose a more realistic and eﬃcient hierarchical global airline
network using one of the hierarchical n-Star networks.

1. Introduction
Complex networks have been studied mainly focusing on random graphs, scale-free networks [1] and smallworld networks [2]. We have reconsidered several features of complex networks from a viewpoint of small-world,
and found that the Watts-Strogatz (WS) model becomes a “locally” small-world network when a few links are
exchanged with a small rewiring probability ρ (0 < ρ
1), but it isn’t unnecessarily a small-world network as
a whole (i.e., in terms of average path length L), and its average path length L is as long as that of a random
graph. Also, the average path length L for a Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model has a small-world property in terms of
L ∝ O(logN) (N: the number of total nodes), not as the “absolutely” minimum average path length L. On the other
hand, a new class of small-world network (n-Star network) was generated by an Ant-Colony Optimization[4]inspired method in a self-organizing manner. The average path length L for the n-Star network is the “absolutely”
minimum value among known complex networks [5]. As one of real-world applications, we have proposed a next
generation global airline network using the n-Star network by assigning the star nodes to the selected star airports
in the world [6]. Furthermore, the n-Star network is more robust [7] compared to the bimodal distribution network
[3] and scale-free network [1]. This robust feature will be applicable to a robust communication network as well
as to a robust design for the global airline network. Furthermore, we have proposed a resilient algorithm for the

n-Star network even if the network architecture is completely destroyed by a cyber attack and natural disasters
such as earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, eruptions of volcanoes, etc. [8]
In this study, we will extend the architecture of n-Star network to several hierarchical architectures, and analyze
the network structures using several network parameters. Based on these results, a new hierarchical architecture
for a more realistic and eﬃcient global airline network will be proposed.
2. Hierarchical Structure of Complex Networks
It is well known that real-world networks such as the world-wide web, the Internet, biological and social
networks contain a hierarchical and/or fractal (self-similarity) property which is referred to as “scale-free” characteristics in terms of degree distribution [13] [14] [15]. Some conventional hierarchical complex networks which
are deterministically constructed have been proposed [9][10][11][12] to model the hierarchy. Generally speaking,
the above scale-free networks have a Small-World property with average path length L ∝ O(logN), however, we
will discuss several hierarchical Small-World network architectures with an absolutely short average path length
L.
The author has proposed a new Small-World network called n-Star network [5] inspiring from ACO (AntColony Optimization) [4], by comparing the characteristics of several complex networks from the viewpoint of
Small-World [2]. This network has n star nodes and many peripheral nodes, as shown in Fig. 1 (left). The n star
nodes are completely connected with each other (forming a ”clique”) and with all peripheral nodes. Accordingly,
a remarkable feature of the n-Star network is that the average path length L is always less than 2, independent
of the number of stars n and the total number of nodes N (hence, the number of peripheral nodes N0 ≡ N-n)
which shows the absolutely minimum value of L among known complex networks including a Watts-Stragatz
(WS) model, Barab´asi-Albert (BA) model, random graph, etc. on the condition of the same value of k .
In this study, we will construct several hierarchical structures based on the n-Star network, and analyze the
structures theoretically using several network parameters such as the number of star nodes n, the number of
peripheral nodes N0 , the number of total nodes N, the average degree k , average path length L, and clustering
coeﬃcients C. By deﬁning a new network index R ≡ L + p = L + k /(N − 1) (p: link probability), we showed
that the degree of Small-World can be evaluated based on the R values for several complex networks [5].
The concept of hierarchical structure for the n-Star network is shown in Fig.1 (right). The star nodes as shown
in red are located at the center in each layer l, and the peripheral nodes as shown in blue are located on the
periphery of the star nodes in each layer l. A part of the peripheral nodes in the l-th layer become the star nodes
in the next (l + 1)-th layer. This shows a kind of fractal (self-similar) structure. Based on the structure, six kinds

2412

of hierarchical n-Star networks can be constructed in the following sections, and analyzed using several network
parameters mentioned above.
2.1. Hierarchial type

Fig. 2. Hierarchical type of n-Star networks and its analysis on network parameters

A hierarchical type of n-Star network is shown in Fig.2 (upper-left) for the case of the number of star nodes
n=3, the number of peripheral nodes N0 =10, and the number of layers l=10. Its adjacency matrix and the degree
distribution are shown in upper-middle. In this case, the number of total nodes becomes N=103, the average degree
is k =6.408, the average path length is L=4.82, the Small-World index is R=4.88, and the clustering coeﬃcient
is C=0.801. According to the adjacency matrix and the network structure, we can ﬁnd a fractal structure of the
nework. The analytical results of N, k , L and C as a function of (n, N0 , l) are shown in Fig.2 (bottom-left), and
the 3D viewgraphs for k , L and C as a function of (n, l) are shown in Fig. 2 (right). The average degree k
monotonically increases proportional to the increase in n, and L also monotonically increases proportional to the
increase in l.
2.2. Torus type
A torus type of n-Star network is shown in Fig.3 (top-left) for the case of the number of star nodes n=3,
the number of peripheral nodes N0 =10, and the number of layers l=10. The adjacency matrix and the degree
distribution are shown in middle-right. The l-th layer is connected with the ﬁrst layer to form a torus using the
hierarchical type shown in Fig.2. In this case, the number of total nodes is N=100, the average degree is k =6.6,
the average path length is L=3.93, the Small-World index is R= 3.998, and the clustering coeﬃcient is C=0.794.
Compared to the hierarchical type in Fig.2, k is slightly large, L and C are slightly small. This architecture is

Hidefumi Sawai / Procedia Computer Science 18 (2013) 2410 – 2419

2413

similar to the structure of “Snake of Uroboros” in the center of the network which is thought to represent the
hierarchy in nature. The analytical results of N, k , L and C as a function of (n, N0 , l) are shown in Fig.3 (bottomleft), and the 3D viewgraphs for k , L and C as a function of (n, l) are shown in the right of the ﬁgure. Note that
the formulas for L are diﬀerent according to whether l is even or odd.
2.3. Star type
A star type of n-Star network is shown in Fig.4 (upper-left) with its adjacency matrix and degree distribution.
The central n-Star network is connected with the peripheral (l-1) n-Star networks to form a star as a whole. In
the case of the number of star nodes n=3, the number of peripheral nodes N0 =7, and the number of layers l=10,
the number of total nodes becomes N=100, the average degree is k =6.42, the average path length is L=3.04,
the Small-World index is R= 3.107, and the clustering coeﬃcient is C=0.803. L is smaller than those of the
hierarchical type in Fig.2 and the torus type in Fig.3. The analytical results of N, k , L and C as a function of
(n, N0 , l) are shown in Fig.4 (bottom-left), and the 3D viewgraphs for k , L and C as a function of (n, l) is shown
in the right of the ﬁgure. A characteristic of the star type of network is that the values of L are saturated under 3
as the number of layer l increases.
2.4. Star-Torus type
A star-torus type of n-Star network with its adjacency matrix and degree distribution is shown in Fig.5 (upperleft). This network is an integrated network combining the torus type in Fig.3 with the star type in Fig.4. As
examples, in the case of n=3, N0 =7, and l=10, N=100, k =8.04, L=2.86, R=2.94, C=0.814. The value of L is the

2414

smallest among above mentioned networks. The analytical results of N, k , L and C as a function of (n, N0 , l) are
shown in Fig.5 (bottom-left), and the 3D viewgraphs for k , L and C as a function of (n, l) are shown in the right
of the ﬁgure. Compared to the star type in Fig.4, the values of L are more controlled under 3 as l increases.
2.5. Fractal type I
A fractal type I of n-Star network with its adjacency matrix and degree distribution is shown in Fig.6 (upperleft). There are n n-Star networks at the center, and N0 n-Star networks on the periphery. The architecture forms
a fractal (self-similarity) structure, and the relationship of l=n+N0 is always formed. As examples, when n=3,
N0 =7, l=10 and N=100, k =9.12, L=2.74, R=2.83, C=0.828. The analytical results of N, k , L and C as a
function of (n, l) are shown in Fig.6 (bottom-left), and the 3D viewgraphs for k , L and C as a function of (n, l)
are shown in the right of the ﬁgure. The increase in L is the smallest among the above mentioned ﬁve kinds of
networks as l increases, while controlling its L values under 3.
2.6. Fractal type II
A fractal type II of n-Star network with its adjacency matrix and degree distribution is shown in Fig.7 (upperleft). As examples, the network architecture is shown in the case of n=l=5, N0 =15, N=100, k =8.7, L=2.61,
R=2.70 and C=0.841. A “clique” with l=5 star nodes is formed at the center, and at the same time each star node
belongs to each star node in each peripheral cluster, which also forms another n-Star network with n=l=5 stars in
a diﬀerent level, which leads to a fractal structure as a whole network. The analytical results of N, k , L and C
as a function of (n, N0 , l) are shown in Fig.7 (bottom-left), and the 3D viewgraphs for k , L and C as a function

Fig. 5. Star-Torus type of n-Star networks and its analysis on network parameters

of (n/l, N0 ) are shown in the right of the ﬁgure. The increase in L is the smallest among the above mentioned six
kinds of networks as l increases, while controlling its L values under 3.
3. Analysis of Small-World Index R
The analytical results on the Small-World index R for several hierarchical structures of n-Star networks as a
function of (n, l) or (n, N0 ) are shown in Fig.8. The minimum value of the Small-World index R is 2 for the basic
n-Star networks independent of n and N (hence k and L). The smaller R, the better for small-world. Generally
speaking, the Small-World index is the best (smallest) in the following order of types: the fractal type II, fractal
type I, star-torus type, star type, torus type and hierarchical type. For examples, for the case of n=3, l=10 (l=5
for the fractal II type only) and N=100 (N=103 for the hierarchical type only), the R values are 2.64, 2.74, 2.86,
3.04, 3.93 and 4.82, respectively in this order. Table 1 shows the comparison of network parameters in several
hierarchical structures of n-Star network. From this table, we can ﬁnd that the fractal II type of n-Star network
is the best (minimum) small-world in terms of the average path length L as well as the Small-World index R. In
the next section, we will apply the fractal II type n-Star network to reorganize a more realistic next generation of
global airline network.
4. Application to Hierarchical Structure of Global Airline Networks
We have proposed a method for reorganizing a next generation global airline network using the n-Star network[6],
where the airline network architecture has not only the merit of saving mileage, but is more eﬃcient and convenient to both airline companies and travelers because of the shortest cruising distance (e.g. 1.32 r = 8,404 km for

k = 13.2, k is the average ﬂight service per airport and r is the radius of Earth, about 6,367 km) and the least
number of transits on average (i.e. only one transit is necessary between any two cities for any value of k ).
A global airline network based on the fractal type II of n-Star network is shown in Fig.9, where the top 100
important cities/airports in the world [16] are connected according to the mutual values between any two cities.
This situation causes some peripheral links between the important cities. The left ﬁgure in Fig.9 shows the airline
network, and the right ﬁgures show its adjacency matrix and the load distribution for the 100 cities/airports. Based
on the hierarchical airline network, the average degree k is 15.5, the average cruising distance L(dist) between
any two airports is 8,975km (1.4096 in the unit of radius of the Earth), the average number of transits L(step)-1 =
1.421, the Small-World index R = 2.577, and the clustering coeﬃcient C = 0.801. The load on the 100 airports is
moderately distributed over all airports with an allowable concentration on the star airports and speciﬁc airports
such as New York (No.1), London (No.2), Tokyo (No.6), Zurich (No.7), Atlanta (No.31), Moscow (No.58), S˜ao
Paulo (No.62) and Jiangsu (No.84), as shown in Fig.9 (bottom-right).
5. Discussions
We have constructed several hierarchical architectures based on the n-Star network, and analyzed their features
using several kinds of network parameters. According to Table 1, the average path lengths L decrease in the
following order of types: the hierarchical type, torus type, star type, star-torus type, fractal type I and fractal
type II (also, the Small-World indexes R decrease in this order). This feature will be useful when we design a
hierarchical network system such as an eﬃcient communication and transportation network for a global airline
network connected with a domestic airline network. As examples, we showed a more realistic and eﬃcient airline

network as one of the real-world applications. In reality, when the accidents including random failures, cyber or
intentional attacks sometimes happen on the communication and transportation networks, we have to recover them
from the accidents as soon as possible. For that purpose, the n-Star network is not only robust in nature compared
to conventional networks [7], but also serves the resilient algorithm to automatically restore it with some alive
nodes from the failures [8]. We will be able to expect that the hierarchical architectures of n-Star network also
inherit the robustness and resilience of the n-Star network for such a situation.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, the n-Star network which was generated in a self-organizing manner inspiring from Ant-Colony
Optimization was extended to several hierarchical architectures that will be more useful for real-world applications. The proposed architectures are six kinds of networks based on the n-Star network including the hierarchical
type, torus type, star type, star-torus type, fractal type I and fractal type II. We analyzed the features of the hierarchical networks using several network parameters. Based on the R values for the networks, the “Small-Worldness”
is the best in the following order of types: the fractal type II, fractal type I, star-torus type, star type, torus type and
hierarchical type. As one of real-world applications, the fractal type II of n-Star network was successfully applied
to a next generation global airline network to reorganize it as a more realistic, eﬃcient and convenient network for
passengers and airline companies. Future works will focus on exploring the other real-world applications using
the proposed hierarchical n-Star networks.
