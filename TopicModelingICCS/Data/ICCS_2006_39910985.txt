Abstract. Reducing the handover latency has been one of the most critical
research issues in Mobile IPv6. The research includes the fast handover, the
hierarchical handover, and variations of them. This paper proposes a variation
of the hierarchical handover and develops analytical models to compare the
performance of the proposed scheme with that used in the hierarchical mobile
networks. The performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme is very
effective for applications like Telematics where mobile nodes move fast. The
paper also gives readers the threshold values with which they can select an
optimal handover scheme for the given applications.

1 Introduction
The mobility support in Mobile IPv6 [1] is one of the most important research issues
to provide many mobile users with the seamless Internet services. In the Internet
environments, when a Mobile Node (MN) moves and attaches itself to another
network, it needs to obtain a new IP address. Mobile IPv6 describes how the MN
maintains connectivity to the Internet when it changes its Access Router (AR) into
another. The process is called handover. During this process, there is a time period
when the MN is unable to send or receive the IPv6 packets due to link switching
delay and IP protocol operations. The time period is called handover latency.
Reducing the handover latency has been a critical research issue to support the
seamless service for mobile users. There have been many standardization works such
as the hierarchical Mobile IPv6 mobility management (HMIPv6) [2], [3], the fast
handover for Mobile IPv6 (FMIPv6) [3], [4], and the simultaneous bindings for fast
handover [5]. The paper focuses on the handover in the hierarchical mobile networks.
We propose a variation, which can be adapted to applications like Telematices where
MNs move fast.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 proposes a new handover
scheme. Section 3 presents the analytical models and shows the result of the
performance evaluation. Finally, Section 4 concludes the paper.

2 The Proposed Approach
Figure 1 describes the basic operation of the proposed handover scheme. The main
idea of the proposed scheme is that it carries out the Mobility Anchor Point (MAP)
binding with an MN’s Home Address instead of its Regional Care-of Address
(RCoA). When an MN enters a new MAP domain as shown in Figure 1, it discovers a
new MAP domain as it receives the MAP Option advertised by the MAP. The MAP
informs the visiting MNs of its presence by sending the Router Advertisement (RA)
message including its prefix information [7]. And then MN needs to configure only
on-Link Care-of Address (LCoA), by appending its interface identifier to the prefix
sent by the RA message [6], without configuring a new RCoA when it moves into the
MAP domain. The MN initializes the MAP registration with its LCoA and its Home
Address. The LCoA is used as the source address of the Binding Update (BU)
message as done in the HMIPv6. The Home Address is included in the Home Address
Option. The MAP will bind the LCoA to the Home Address instead of the RCoA.
Thus, the proposed scheme does not have to perform the Duplicate Address Detection
(DAD) process for the RCoA any more. Note the fact that the MN’s Home address
replaces its RCoA. The MAP may include an On-link Care-Of address Test (OCOT)
Option in the Binding Acknowledgement (BA). The OCOT Option is in detail
specified in [2]. The last process is identical as done in the HMIPv6.
After the MAP registeration, the MN must register its MAP’s IP address, included
in the MAP Option, with its HA or CNs by sending a BU message that specifies the
binding of the MAP’s IP address and its home address. The home address is put in the
Home Address Option and the MAP’s IP address can be involved in the source
address field or the Alternate Care-of Address Option. The IP address of the MAP is
used instead of the RCoA.

The proposed scheme deletes the overhead of configuring the RCoA and the
corresponding DAD procedure while adding the overhead of the home address in the
data packet. Thus, the proposed scheme will be appropriate for the application like
Telematics where a mobile user moves very fast across MAP domains.

3 Performance Evaluation
Table 1 depicts the notations used in the analytical models. The default MTU size for
IPv6 packets on an Ethernet is 1500 bytes [8]. The delay for the DAD is set to the
MAX_RTX_SOLICITION_DELAY (1 second), the maximum transmission delay of
the NS message [7]. The total of the packet size includes the IPv6 Basic Header and
some of optional IPv6 Extension Headers. The other IPv6 Extension Headers are
omitted due to the variety of its size and the optional preference.

Figure 2-(a) shows that the larger the size of MAP is, the smaller the difference
between two schemes will become. Figure 2-(b) shows that the delay of the proposed
scheme is less than that of HMIPv6 at the same rate. The difference results from the
DAD cost and is small in this case. Figure 2-(c) and Figure 2-(d) provide the
threshold value in the specific point, respectively.

4 Conclusion
The paper proposes a variation of the handover scheme used in the HMIPv6. The
paper also develops the analytical models to compare the performance of the
proposed scheme and that used in the HMIPv6. The result shows that the proposed
scheme is very effective regardless of the frequency of the packet transmission if it
enables the packet to transfer by a MTU and the MN moves fast. In particular, the
proposed scheme can be adapted to Telematics services where an user drives fast and
sometimes receives the Internet services using the terminal in the car.
