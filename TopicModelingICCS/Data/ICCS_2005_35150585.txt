Abstract. Saving energy consumption for a long network lifetime is one of the
most important issues in design of wireless sensor networks because they usually consist of a large number of nodes with limited battery power. In this paper, we propose a balanced tree construction scheme called BATR (Balanced
Aggregation Tree Routing), which uses near optimal minimal spanning tree for
balancing the power consumptions over all nodes. Our main idea is that if energy consumed for transmission and reception can be nicely balanced over all
nodes, an optimal data aggregation can be achieved in terms of network lifetime. Simulation results assure that the BATR can lengthen system lifetime as
compared with the conventional data aggregation protocols.

1 Introduction
Recent advancements in wireless communication and highly progressed hardware
technology have enabled the development of a wireless sensor with a low-cost processor, low-power, and light-weight. Each sensor collects useful information from the
region in a variety of scenarios including military surveillance and landmine detection
in harsh physical environments and monitoring [1]. Typically, sensor nodes collect
audio, seismic, and other types of data and collaborate to perform a high-level task in
a sensor web. Since wireless communications consume a significant amount of battery power, sensor nodes should be energy efficient in transmitting data. Energy
efficient communication in wireless networks is attracting increasing attention in the
literature.
Since sensor nodes might generate significant redundant data, data aggregation is
usually used for wireless routing in sensor networks [2][3]. In each round of this datagathering application, all data from all nodes need to be collected and transmitted to
the sink, where the end-user can access the data [9]. There are also different protocols
proposed in literatures ([7][8]) so as to maximize the lifetime of the system under
different circumstances. The simplest approach to routing in wireless sensor networks
is direct transmission, in which each node transmits its own data directly to the sink.
In direct transmission, if the location of sink is far from sensor field, each sensor
node dissipates a large amount of energy.

LEACH(Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy)[9] is proposed in order to efficiently do data gathering and aggregation. LEACH is a clustering-based protocol
that utilizes randomized rotation of the cluster-heads to evenly distribute the energy
load among the sensor nodes in the network. It assumes that the sink is fixed and
located far from the sensors, and all nodes in the network are homogeneous and energy-constrained. But, LEACH is impractical, since it is directly transmission method.
Thus, It is desirable to multi-hop transmit in wireless sensor network In [10], the
authors propose a new minimum spanning tree-based protocol, called PEDAP (Power
Efficient Data Gathering and Aggregation Protocol) and its power-aware version
(PEDAP-PA). In PEDAP, the locations of all nodes are known by sink a priori, and
path information of network is computed by sink. PEDAP is based on minimum
spanning tree routing scheme as well. These previous research and concurrent works
on protocol and algorithm designed in sensor networks are summarized in [1][4][5].
In this paper, we propose a balanced-tree based routing protocol called BATR
(Balanced Aggregation Tree Routing) to achieve an optimal data aggregating in terms
of the network lifetime by balancing power consumption per node. In our scheme,
each intermediate node keeps the number of children nodes and it transmits the data
to the nearest neighbor node. Our scheme may minimize the energy consumption in
each node, thus prolong the lifetime of the system regardless of location of the sink is
outside or inside the sensor field.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The BATR protocol is described in
detail in Section 2. Next, in Section 3, we present our simulation results. Finally, we
conclude the paper and present future research directions in Section 4.

2 Balanced Aggregation Tree Routing Protocol
2.1 System Model
Data aggregation, which is the combination of data from different multiple sources, is
needed for saving energy by reducing the number of messages in the network. In
general, data gathering requires some energy at intermediate nodes. To investigate
power consumption in wireless sensor network, we use a radio model as described in
[12], which is the first free space channel model where the power loss d2 is used.
First, we formally model the network as a graph G = {V,E} where V is the set of
nodes {0,…..,n} in the network and E is set of edges between nodes. We assume that
combining n packets of size k results in one packet of size k instead of size nk [10].
We define the edges by ∀x and ∀y ∈ V , ∃(x, y) ∈ E ⇔ dist(x, y) ≤ d , where d is the transmission range of sensor nodes in the network and dist (x , y) is the Euclidean distance
between nodes x and y which are said to be neighbors of each other. The set of
neighbors of a node X is denoted as neighbors (X). For a tree T constructed for aggregation tree from graph G, we call a set X ⊆ V , a group iff X = {Y } Υ Z where Y is the
parent of nodes of Z in the tree T [11].
To transmit a k-bit packet over a distance d, the radio expends

ETx (k , d ) = kE elec + kd 2 ε fs
to receive this message, the radio expends

In these radio parameters, Eelec means a radio dissipates to run the transmitter or reciever circuitary and ε fs for the transmitter amplifier separately.
As seen above, since the energy cost consists of two components, one for transmitting or receiving a packet in the radio electronics and the other depending on the distance in transmissions, the routing protocols must minimize the number of data receptions and while minimizing the transmit distance for a specific node. In order to
maximize the network lifetime, the total energy should be minimized in a round of
communication, while balancing the energy consumption among the nodes. An ideal
aggregation tree can be thought as a balanced tree with a minimum number of edges,
equivalent children nodes in order to maximize the network lifetime. For this, our
protocol is designed to find an optimal path based on a balanced tree that has almost
the same number of children nodes below itself. Here, the child node means the node
that could exist in any neighborhood.
To describe our protocol, we assume that the system consists of n sensors distributed randomly in the environment that is being monitored. We assume that sink
knows the locations of all nodes priori either by manually entering coordinates or by
using the GPS. Each node periodically senses its nearby environment and would like
to send its data to a sink. The sensor nodes, including the sink in the network have
equal transmission range (say d). The nodes aggregate or fuse the data they receive
from the others with their own data, and produce only one packet regardless of how
many packets they receive. In addition, it is assumed that all nodes generate equal
amount of data, and there is no mobility in the network[10].
2.2 Detailed Procedure
In our protocol, the routing information is computed using a MST(Minimum Spanning Tree) algorithm. Given a topology graph G(V, E), it begins with the root node
and starts iteratively establishing parent-child relationship with other nodes. Sink
functions as a root node in MST.
(1) Initially, we start the path construction from sink as a root.
(2) After that, we select the nearest nodes among neighbors as many as the number
of decided children nodes from a vertex in the tree to a vertex not in the tree, and
add that edge to the tree. In our case, data will be send through that edges just included in the tree from each node. In our protocol, we balance the number of
children nodes depending on the density of network to achieve a long lifetime.
Here, the number of children nodes, denoted by µ , is given as an operational
parameter whose value can be calculated by

µ ( R) = α

Nπ R 2
A

(3)

where N is the number of scattered sensor nodes in region A, and R can be either
the range of a particular sensor or the radio transmission range (idealized with
circular propagation) [13]. Basically, µ (R ) gives the number of nodes within

588

the transmission radius of each node in region A. α is a variable which depends
on the position of sink. If the number of children nodes is a, energy consumption
of intermediate node for data aggregation is

Eintermediate(k, a, d) =kEelec + kd2ε fs + a(kEelec + kEDA)

(4)

So, the total energy expended by the network is given by the sum of energies used
by each node ( E = E ).

(3) When neighbor node is found over the limit of search, the node is labeled as a
leaf node. We set the search limit at 15 for prevention of delay.
(4) We repeat this procedure until all available nodes are added to the tree.
(5) After some certain number of rounds, the sink recomputes the routing information considering the condition of nodes and resetting the number of children
nodes. After each computation, the sink sends each node the required routing information for that node such as the node’s parent in the tree in order to reach to
the sink and the number of child nodes, etc.
Fig. 1 shows the process of tree construction and the result of routing paths for a
sample network when children nodes are under two. A dotted line indicates the path
which is node’s aggregation information including death node. And solid line shows
the resulting routing paths for a sample network.

3 Simulation Results
We use the simulation programs written in C++ program language to evaluate the
performance of our scheme. Our scheme is compared with direct transmission,
LEACH, and non-balanced routing scheme which uses Prim’s spanning tree algorithm. The network dimensions for our experiments is 100 × 100 and 100 nodes are
randomly generated within the region. We run the simulations with different position
of sink: to the center of the field and to the place away from the region.

Fig. 2 shows the number of rounding of death nodes for networks where the sink is
located in the center of the field. In general, the direct transmission can offer a satisfactory performance when the transmission distance between the node and the sink is
not so far. However, BATR shows a similar performance to the direct transmission
after the number of dead nodes reaches 50%. We can predict this result from Eq. (4)
since there is no child node when more than 50% of nodes are dead. Taken as a
whole, BATR improves the lifetime about 1.5 times compared with non-balanced tree
protocol.

Fig. 3 indicates that BATR is the best power saving system when sink is far away
from the field. As seen in Fig. 4, the lifetime obtained with direct transmission is very
short since if the sink is far away from nodes, the nodes will consume more energy for
data transmission and so die quickly. In case of non-balanced tree, distant nodes
should send data directly after a certain time since nodes around the sink die first. On
the other hand, dead nodes will be distributed uniformly over the network in BATR
since the distances among nodes are not so far.
Fig. 4(a) shows that the lifetime as the number of children nodes is varied. It is
worth to note that our scheme also performs well when the sink is outside the field.
As shown from Eq. (1), energy consumption of each node is proportional to the
square of distance between nodes. When the number of children nodes is incremented, the depth of tree is decreased but the distance between nodes becomes large.
So, each node will consume more energy at this time. In our experiments, we can see
that the longest lifetime can be achieved when there are two children nodes in case
that sink is located far away from the field. Further, as we increase the number of
children nodes, the network lifetime becomes shortened.

Fig. 4. Lifetime versus the number of children nodes

Fig. 4(b) represents a lifetime versus the number of children nodes when sink is
located at the center of the field. We can observe almost the same lifetime regardless
of the average number of children nodes. This is because the number of children
nodes does not affect the energy consumption so much while the distance between
nodes is the most dominant factor to the energy consumption.
To evaluate distribution characteristics of energy consumption in the network, we
measure standard deviation of loads over all sensor nodes after each round. A large
variance in load signifies that load is not uniformly distributed among the nodes. Fig.
5 demonstrates that our approach outperforms the non-balanced tree protocols.

Fig. 5. Standard deviation of loads as the number of dead sensors is increased

As previously described, the energy cost consists of two components, one is the
number of children nodes and the other is transmission distance. Therefore, the
routing protocols must minimize the number of data receptions and reduce the
distance of transmission between specific nodes. In BATR, a node with large
transmission distance becomes a leaf node on a tree. So, it can save energy because
it does not need aggregation and receiving. In case of intermediate nodes, the
deviation of energy consumption can be reduced by balancing the number of children nodes.

4 Conclusion and Future Works
Distributing the load evenly to the nodes has a great impact on system lifetime. In this
paper, we propose a power efficient routing protocol based on a balanced tree. Our
main idea is minimizing the total energy of the system by balancing of energy consumption among the nodes. We show through simulations that our scheme performs
near optimal regardless of the position of the sink and outperforms the conventional
approaches such as LEACH and non-balanced tree protocols.
Our future work involves several refinements and extensions of this work, as well
as establishment of analytical models to get more comprehensive underlying performance limit.
