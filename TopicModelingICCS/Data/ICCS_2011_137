Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) simulation is ubiquitous in contemporary antenna design process. For many structures, including
ultrawideband or dielectric resonator antennas, EM-simulation-driven optimization is the only way to adjust the geometry parameters
so that given performance specifications are satisfied. On the other hand, accurate full-wave antenna simulation is computationally
expensive so that employing the EM solver directly in the optimization loop may be impractical. In this paper, several
computationally efficient simulation-driven antenna design techniques are discussed. All of the methods exploit coarse-discretization
EM models of the structures under consideration. After suitable correction, these models serve as reliable prediction tools that guide
the optimization process. As the coarse-discretization model is computationally much cheaper than the original, high-fidelity antenna
model, the cost of the design process is greatly reduced. The specific approaches presented here include multi-fidelity optimization,
adaptive design specifications and space mapping with kriging-based coarse models. Application examples are given.
Keywords: Simulation-driven design, microwave engineering, electromagnetic simulation, antenna design, surrogate models.

1. Introduction
Contemporary antenna design is a challenging problem that involves the adjustment of a number of geometry
parameters in order to satisfy various, often conflicting objectives concerning matching requirements as well as radiation
figures such as gain, pattern, etc. [1]. Additionally, various “near-field” and “far-field” interactions between the antenna
itself and its environment have to be taken into account. Examples include connectors, installation environment, e.g.,
vehicle platforms, radomes, device housing, etc. [1]. In most cases, analytical models—if available—can only be used to
yield initial designs that need to be further tuned to meet performance specifications and growing demands for accuracy
[1]-[4]. Therefore, electromagnetic (EM)-simulation-based design and design optimization becomes increasingly
important. In fact, it is the only option for antenna structures such as ultrawideband (UWB) antennas [1], [3] or dielectric
resonator antennas (DRAs) [2] where no systematic procedures are available that would result in designs satisfying
prescribed specifications if the feeding and environment interactions have to accounted for.
The major bottleneck of EM-simulation-driven optimization is its high computational cost. High-fidelity full-

wave antenna simulation typically takes a few hours so that straightforward approaches employing the
electromagnetic solver directly in an optimization loop are impractical. Efficient simulation-driven design can be
realized using a surrogate-based optimization (SBO) principle [5], [6]. In SBO optimization the computational
burden is shifted to a surrogate model, a computationally cheap representation of the optimized structure. The
successful SBO approaches used in microwave area include space mapping (SM) [7]-[11], tuning and tuning SM
[12], [13]. Unfortunately, applicability of these techniques for antenna design is limited. Space mapping normally
relies on a fast coarse model, typically, circuit equivalent [7], [11]. Reliable circuit equivalents are not available for
many important types of antenna, e.g., for DRAs [1], [2], UWB antennas [1], [3], and Yagi antennas [1], [4]. On the
other hand, simulation-based tuning is not directly applicable for radiating structures.
It should be mentioned that a number of meta-heuristic approaches [14] have been applied to antenna design, e.g.,
genetic algorithms [15], particle swarm optimizers [16], or ant colony optimization [17]. Although these methods allow
handling certain issues such as multiple local optima, they normally require massive amounts of function calls and,
therefore, they are not recommended when high-fidelity EM simulations are used for antenna evaluation.
In this paper, we discuss several methodologies that are suitable for the simulation-driven design of antennas. In
order to speed up the design process, these techniques exploit coarse-discretization EM simulations as the low-fidelity
antenna models. Such models are not as accurate as the original, high-fidelity simulations, but they are computationally
much cheaper. After suitable correction, they can be used in place of high-fidelity models in the optimization process.
Another advantage is that coarse-discretization EM models are available for all conceivable antenna structures so that
the methodologies presented here are general.
We focus on three design optimization approaches that are straightforward to implement, and yet computationally
efficient. The first technique is based on sequential optimization of coarse-discretization EM models describing the
same structure. The optimal design of the current model is used as an initial design for the finer-discretization one. The
final design is obtained in the refinement procedure that exploits a polynomial-based approximation model of the
coarse-discretization EM data. The unavoidable misalignment between the polynomial and the fine model is corrected
using space mapping [18]. The second technique exploits similar idea; however, it does not apply any corrections to the
coarse-discretization models directly. Instead, the discrepancy between the low- and high-fidelity models is accounted
for by modification of design specifications [19]. The last methodology exploits space mapping as the optimization
engine with the underlying coarse model created by kriging interpolation of the coarse-discretization EM simulation
data [20]. This approach allows us to use the flexibility of space mapping without compromising the computational
cost because—once created—the kriging-based coarse model is very fast.
The techniques presented here are demonstrated through several antenna design examples including a microstrip
antenna on a multilayer substrate, ultrawideband monopole, and dielectric resonator antenna. In all cases,
satisfactory design is obtained at a low computational cost corresponding to a few high-fidelity EM simulations of
the antenna structure under consideration.
2. Antenna Design Using Coarse-Discretization Electromagnetic Models
The antenna design problem can be formulated as a nonlinear minimization problem of the form
x*f

arg min U  R f ( x ) 
x

(1)

where Rf(x)  Rm denotes the response vector of a high-fidelity (fine) model of the antenna of interest; U is a given
objective function (e.g., typically minimax [14]), whereas x  Rn is a vector of design variables, typically, the geometry
parameters. The most common objective in the antenna design is to minimize so-called reflection coefficient |S11| over
certain frequency band of interest. Other objectives may concern the antenna gain or the shape of the radiation pattern. It is
assumed that the computational cost of evaluating the high-fidelity model is high so that solving (1) directly is impractical.
Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) [5] seems to be the most suitable approach for making EM-simulation-driven
design optimization practical. The SBO techniques exploiting physics-based low fidelity models can be particularly
efficient [7]. As mentioned in the introduction, space mapping [7], [11] and simulation-based tuning [13] have
demonstrated their efficiency for a number of problems of microwave design. However, practical applicability of these
methods is limited to situations where fast circuit equivalents are readily available, e.g., in case of microstrip filters or

1254

transformers [7]-[10]. In order to efficiently apply SBO techniques for antenna design we have to look for other, more
versatile types of low-fidelity models. Here, we exploit the models obtained through coarse-discretization of the original
structure. The major advantage is that such models can be obtained for any antenna. Moreover, coarse-discretization
models can be implemented with the same EM solver as used to evaluate the high-fidelity one, by applying relaxed mesh
requirements (which also simplifies implementation of the optimization algorithm). On the other hand, coarsediscretization EM models are still relatively expensive when compared to circuit equivalents. Therefore, practical
optimization techniques should be designed to reduce not only the number of evaluations of the high-fidelity model but
also the number of coarse-discretization EM simulations (otherwise, the computational overhead related to low-fidelity
model evaluations could determine the total design cost). In particular, coarse-discretization EM models are normally too
expensive to serve as immediate coarse models for efficient SM implementation. This would be particularly problematic
for the parameter extraction step of SM which requires a substantial number of model evaluations [10].
In the next sections, we discuss three optimization approaches utilizing coarse-discretization EM models that are
suitable for simulation-driven antenna design. These methods are simple to implement, versatile, and
computationally efficient. The description of each method is followed by an application example.
3. Multi-Level Optimization Exploiting Coarse-Discretization EM Models
3.1. Optimization Algorithm
The design optimization methodology described here is based on a family of coarse-discretization models {Rc.j},
j = 1, …, K, all evaluated by the same EM solver as the one used for the fine model. Discretization of the model
Rc.j+1 is finer than that of the model Rc.j, which results in better accuracy but also longer evaluation time. In practice,
the number of coarse-discretization models is two or three.
Having the optimized design x(K) of the last (and finest) coarse-discretization model Rc.K, we evaluate it at all perturbed
designs around x(K), i.e., at xk(K) = [x1(K) … xk(K) + sign(k)·dk … xn(K)]T, k = –n, –n+1, …, n–1, n. We use the notation R(k) =
Rc.K(xk(K)). This data can be used to refine the final design without directly optimizing Rf. Instead, we set up an
approximation model involving R(k) and optimize it in the neighborhood of x(K) defined as [x(K) – d, x(K) + d], where d = [d1
d2 … dn]T. The size of the neighborhood can be selected based on sensitivity analysis of Rc.1 (the cheapest of the coarsediscretization models); usually d equals 2 to 5 percent of x(K).
Here, approximation is performed using a reduced quadratic model q(x) = [q1 q2 … qm]T, defined as
q j ( x)

q j ([ x1 ... xn ]T )

O j.0  O j.1 x1  ...  O j.n xn  O j.n1 x12  ...  O j.2n xn2 .

(2)

Coefficients Oj.r, j = 1, …, m, r = 0, 1, …, 2n, can be uniquely obtained by solving the linear regression problems
qj(xk(K)) = Rj(k), k = –n, –n + 1, …, n – 1, n, where Rj(k) is a jth component of the vector R(k).
In order to account for unavoidable misalignment between Rc.K and Rf, instead of optimizing the quadratic model
q, it is recommended to optimize a corrected model q(x) + [Rf(x(K)) – Rc.K(x(K))] that ensures a zero-order consistency
[21] between Rc.K and Rf. The refined design can be then found as
x*

arg

min

x( K ) d d x d x( K )  d

U (q( x)  [ R f ( x ( K ) )  Rc.K ( x ( K ) )]) .

(3)

This kind of correction is also known as output space mapping [10]. If necessary, the step (3) can be performed a
few times starting from a refined design, i.e., x* = argmin{x(K) – d ≤ x ≤ x(K) + d : U(q(x) + [Rf(x*) – Rc.K(x*)])} (each
iteration requires only one evaluation of Rf).
The design optimization procedure can be summarized as follows (input arguments are: initial design x(0) and the
number of coarse-discretization models K):
1. Set j = 1;
2. Optimize coarse-discretization model Rc.j to obtain a new design x(j) using x(j–1) as a starting point;
3. Set j = j + 1; if j < K go to 2;
4. Obtain a refined design x* as in (3);
5. End;

Note that the the original model Rf is only evaluated at the final stage (step 4) of the optimization process.
Operation of the algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1. Coarse-discretization models can be optimized using any available
algorithm, e.g., simple pattern search algorithm [18] or Matlab’s minimax routine fminimax [22].
As mentioned before, the number K of coarse-discretization models is typically two or three. The first coarsediscretization model Rc.1 should be set up so that its evaluation time is at least 30 to 100 times shorter than the evaluation
time of the fine model. The reason is that the initial design may be quite poor so that the expected number of evaluations
of Rc.1 is usually large. By keeping Rc.1 cheap, one can control the computational overhead related to its optimization.
Accuracy of Rc.1 is not critical because its optimal design is only supposed to give a rough estimate of the fine model
optimum. The second (and, possibly third) coarse-discretization model should be more accurate but still at least about 10
times faster than the fine model. This can be achieved by proper manipulation of the EM solver mesh density.
3.2. Example: Design of Wideband Microstrip Antenna
Consider a wideband antenna [23], Fig. 2, where x = [l1 l2 l3 l4 w2 w3 d1 s]T are the design variables. Multilayer
substrate is ls×ls (ls=30mm). The antenna stack (from bottom-to-top) is: ground, RO4003 substrate, signal trace,
RO3006 substrate with a through via (signal trace-to-patch), the driven patch, RO4003, and four patches. Feeding is
with 50ohm SMA connector. The design objective is |S11| ≤ –10 dB for 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz. IEEE gain not less than 5
dB in vertical direction (for zero zenith angle, Fig. 2) and over the frequency band of interest is an optimization constraint.
The initial design is x(0) = [15 15 15 15 20 –4 2 2]T mm. We use two coarse-discretization models: Rc.1 (122,713 mesh
cells at x(0)) and Rc.2 (777,888 mesh cells). The EM models are defined using CST Microwave Studio [24] and simulated
with the transient solver. The evaluation times for Rc.1, Rc.2 and Rf (2,334,312 mesh cells) are 3 min, 18 min and 160 min at
x(0), respectively. Figure 3 (a) shows the responses of Rc.1 at x(0) and at its optimal design x(1). Figure 3 (b) shows the
responses of Rc.2 at x(1) and at its optimized design x(2). Figure 3 (c) shows the responses of Rf at x(0), at x(2) and at the
refined design x* = [14.87 13.95 15.4 13.13 20.87 –5.90 2.88 0.68]T mm (|S11| ≤ –11.5 dB for 3.1 GHz to 4.8 GHz)
obtained in two iterations of the refinement step (3). Antenna gain pattern of the final design is shown in Fig. 4.The design
cost (Table 1) corresponds to about 12 runs of the high-fidelity model Rf.

4. Optimization Using Adaptively Adjusted Design Specifications
4.1. Design Procedure
The discrepancies between the low- and high-fidelity models do not need to be removed by correcting the lowfidelity model response as realized in the method described in the previous section. Another way is to “absorb” the
model misalignment by proper adjustment of the design specifications. In microwave engineering, most of the
design tasks can be formulated as minimax problems with upper and lower specifications and it is easy to implement
modifications by shifting the specification levels, corresponding frequency bands, etc. [19]. The optimization
procedure exploiting this idea consists of the following two simple steps:
1. Modify the original design specifications to account for the discrepancy between the low- and high-fidelity models.
2. Obtain a new design by optimizing the low-fidelity model with respect to the modified specifications.
In Step 1, the design specifications are modified so that the level of satisfying/violating the modified
specifications by the low-fidelity model response corresponds to the satisfaction/violation levels of the original
specifications by the high-fidelity model [19]. The low-fidelity model is then optimized in Step 2 with respect to the
modified specifications and the new design obtained this way is treated as an approximated solution to the original
design problem, i.e., optimization of the high-fidelity model with respect to the original specifications. The validity
of this procedure can be justified as follows. Because the low-fidelity model is physics-based, the adjustment of the

1257

Slawomir Koziel et al. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1252–1261

design variables has similar effect on the response for both the low- and high-fidelity models. As a result, the lowfidelity model design obtained in Step 2 (i.e., optimal with respect to the modified specifications) will be (almost)
optimal for the high-fidelity model with respect to the original specifications.
Steps 1 and 2 can be repeated if necessary. Typically, a substantial improvement is observed after the first iteration.
Additional iterations may bring further enhancement as the discrepancy between the high- and low-fidelity models may
change from one design to another.
Figure 5 illustrates an iteration of our technique used for design of a CBCPW-to-SIW transition [25]. One can observe
that the absolute matching between the low- and high-fidelity models is not as important as the shape similarity.

The monopole is on a 0.508 mm thick Rogers RO3203 substrate. Design variables are x = [h0 w0 a0 s0 h1 w1 lgnd
ws]T (Fig. 6(a)). Other parameters: ls = 25, wm = 1.25, hp =0.75 (all in mm). The microstrip input of the monopole is
fed through an edge mount SMA connector with a hex nut. The ground of the monopole has a profiled edge.
Simulation time of Rc (152,640 mesh cells) is 2 min, and that of Rf (1,151,334 mesh cells) is 45 min (both at the
initial design). The design specifications for reflection are |S11| ≤ –10 dB for 3.1 GHz to 10.6 GHz.
Initial design x(0) = [18 12 2 0 5 1 15 40]T mm. Optimization performed using the adaptively adjusted design
specifications technique yields the final design x(3) = [18.27 19.41 2.02 1.34 1.95 5.83 15.74 35.75] T mm (|S11| < –
14.5 dB in the frequency band of interest) obtained after three iterations of our procedure. Figure 6(b) shows
reflection responses of the high- and low-fidelity models at the initial design as well as the Rf response at the final
design. The total number of evaluations of Rc in the optimization process is 252. Table 2 shows the computational
cost of the optimization: the total optimization time corresponds to about 11 evaluations of the high-fidelity model.

5. Optimization Using Space Mapping and Kriging-Based Coarse Models
5.1. Optimization Algorithm
Space mapping solves the original design problem (1), by generating a sequence of approximate solutions x(i),
i = 0, 1, 2, … as follows:
arg min U  Rs(i ) ( x ) 

x (i 1)

x

(4)

where {Rs(i)} is a family of surrogate models. Here, x(0) is a starting point. Rs(i) is a representation of the high-fidelity
model Rf created using available fine model data, and updated after each iteration. Space mapping constructs the
surrogate models based on the coarse model Rc: a less accurate but computationally cheap representation of the fine
model. Let Rs be a generic SM surrogate model, i.e., Rc composed with suitable (usually linear) transformations. At
iteration i, the surrogate model Rs(i) is defined as
Rs(i ) ( x)

Rs ( x, p(i ) )

(5)

where
p(i ) arg min ¦ k 0 wi.k || R f ( x ( k ) )  Rs ( x ( k ) , p) ||
i

p

(6)

is a vector of model parameters and wi.k are weighting factors (one of typical setups is wi.k = 1 for all i and k) [10].
A variety of SM surrogate models are available [7], [10]. A specific model used in this work is defined as
Rs(i)(x) = Rc(x + c(i)) + d(i). The vector c(i) is obtained in the parameter extraction process (6). The vector d(i) is
calculated as d(i) = Rf(x) – Rc(x + c(i)). The parameter shift x + c(i) is referred to as input SM, while the response
correction through the vector d(i) is called output SM.
Space mapping is a flexible and general surrogate-based optimization methodology [7], however, its application
to antenna design may not be straightforward because SM requires a physically-based and yet computationally
cheap coarse model (preferably, an equivalent circuit). The use of coarse-discretization EM models as the coarse
model may be problematic because the SM algorithm typically requires a large number of coarse model evaluations,
particularly in the parameter extraction step [11]. As EM simulations, even low-fidelity ones, are relatively
expensive (typically, only 10 to 50 times faster than the high-fidelity models), the efficiency of the SM algorithm
could be compromised because of numerous evaluations of the coarse-discretization model.
The workaround is to build a (local) function approximation model using coarse-discretization model data, and treat it
as a coarse model for the space mapping algorithm. This approach has a number of advantages: (i) the coarse model is
computationally cheap, smooth, and therefore, easy to optimize, (ii) there is no need for circuit-equivalent model, and,
consequently, no extra simulation software needs to be involved; the space mapping algorithm implementation is simpler
and exploits a single EM solver, (iii) it is possible to apply space mapping for antenna design problems where finding
reliable and fast coarse models is difficult or impossible. Here, we use kriging [5] as a function approximation technique.
The design procedure is the following:
1. Starting from xinit, find an approximate optimal design x(0) of the coarse-discretization model Rcd. In this
work, we use a pattern search algorithm [26].
2. Sample Rcd in the neighborhood of x(0) and construct a response surface approximation model Rc (here,
kriging [5] as an approximation technique).
3. Find a high-fidelity model optimum by applying the SM algorithm (4)-(6) with Rc as an underlying coarse model.

Operation of the design procedure is illustrated in Fig. 7 using an example of a dielectric resonator antenna. The
SM algorithm yields approximate solutions to our original design problem x* = argmin{x : U(Rf(x))}, where U is an
objective function that measures the violation of the design specifications (here, 20 dB minus the maximum of |S11|
in the frequency band 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz).
The surrogate constructed by means of coarse-discretization model data and the space-mapping alignment are a good
prediction tool. It allows us to locate the high-fidelity model optimum in a few iterations (each iteration amounts to just
one evaluation of the high-fidelity model) so that the entire design process is computationally inexpensive.

[27] installed above a PCB with upper and lower metal grounds. The DRs are covered by a polycarbonate housing
which has dielectric constant and loss tangent of 2.7 and 0.01, respectively. The housing is mounted on the board
with four through M2 bolts. Feeding of the DRA is with a 50 ohm grounded coplanar waveguide (GCPW)
terminated by two symmetrical slots (width s1 and length x1, see Fig. 8(b)) exiting the two coupled TExδ11 mode DRs.
Figure 8 also shows vias forming a substrate integrated (cage-like) cavity. The relative permittivity and loss tangent
of the DRs are 36 and 1e-4.
The feeding with two coplanar slots [26] as shown in Fig. 8(b) allows the DRs to be energized without any
additional components at the GCPW input. However, parallel plate modes can be launched in the substrate by the
feeding slots. This undesirable phenomenon results in increase of the board noise and the drop of the antenna gain. The
parasitic signal in the substrate can be suppressed with trough vias connecting the upper and lower grounds and
forming a cage like substrate integrated cavity. This modification is straightforward as a concept but it introduces
additional degrees of freedom to the design. As a result, simulation-driven design of the DRA becomes hardly feasible
through a single parameter sweep and judgments of the designer. In order to reduce the design cost, fast surrogate
model of the DRA structure under consideration is exploited. We use CST Microwave Studio [24] to define the
electromagnetic (EM) model of the DRA and to evaluate its response for different combinations of design parameters.

Here, dimensions of the DRA are to be adjusted for the 2.4-to-2.5 GHz frequency band. Design requirements are:
input reflection coefficient, |S11|, should be better than –20 dB, and gain is to be higher than 3dBi for T=00 (Zdirection), both over the frequency band of interest.
There are eleven design variables: x=[x0 y0 xd yd zd s1 x1 xv yv sx sy]T, where x0 and y0 are location of the center of
one DR relative to the origin of the coordinate system marked by O in Fig. 8 (b); xd, yd, and zd are dimensions of the
DRs (ceramic body); s1 and x1 are dimensions of the slots energizing the DRs; xv, yv, sx, and sy describe via locations
and in row spacing as shown in Fig. 8(b). The substrate integrated cavity is defined with ten vias in the lower
(horizontal) row, eleven vias in the upper (horizontal) row, and nine vias in the vertical rows, see Fig. 8 (b). Again,
it should be emphasized that our design problem is quite complex not only due to the large number of design
variables but also because of the fact that the EM model of the DRA is computationally expensive (simulation time
about 1 hour per design).
Other dimensional parameters are fixed as follows. Substrate is 2.5 mm thick RT6010. Dimensions of the input
GCPW are signal trace width, w0, of 1.5 mm and spacing, s0, of 1mm. Diameter of the vias, dv, is 1.5 mm.
Thicknesses of the polycarbonate housing, xh, yh, and zh, are 2 mm. Location of the mounting bolts are described by
xh= sx and yh=1 mm. The heads of the bolts are 4 mm in diameters and 1 mm tick. Lateral extension of the housing
is lh=xv+5sx+3 [mm]. The whole structure has a magnetic symmetry plane which is shown with vertical dash-dot
lines in Fig. 8(b). Ground plane and GCPW signal trace metallization is with 1.5 oz (0.05 mm thick) copper.
Design starts from xinit=[x0 y0 xd yd zd s1 x1 xv yv sx sy]T= [7.75 56 16.5 18 2 10.75 6 14 4 6] T mm. The final
design was found to be x* = [7.62 5.70 6.2 16.43 17.9 1.9 10.45 6.08 13.83 4.37 6.03] T mm. The design response
meets the specifications; its |S11| is shown in Fig. 9(a), the gain versus frequency for T=00 is shown in Fig. 9(b).
For the purpose of comparison, the DRA without substrate integrated cavity was also considered. In this case
there were seven design variables x*,n.v.=[x0 y0 xd yd zd s1 x1]T. The optimal designs found for this case do not satisfy
the design requirements (|S11| < –20 dB, gain (T = 00) > 3dBi, both for 2.4-to-2.5 GHz). Figure 9 also gives
responses of the two alternative designs, x*,n.v = [7.65 5.51 5.39 16.20 19.45 0.263 10.05] T mm (|S11| < –11.5 dB,
gain (T = 00) > 2.5dBi) and x**,n.v = [6.79 5.25 5.68 16.22 19.97 0.250 9.46] T mm (|S11| < –13.5 dB, gain (T = 00) >
0.5dBi).
The values of the gain (T = 00) at 2.45 GHz are: 3.7 dBi for design x*, 2.8 dBi for design x*,n.v, and 1.4 dBi for
design x**,n.v. The values of the maximum gain at 2.45 GHz are: 5.4 dBi for design x*, 2.9 dBi for design x*,n.v, and
1.5 dBi for design x**,n.v.. The difference in the values of the antenna gain of the final designs, especially over the
simulation bandwidth, e.g., see Fig. 9(b), can be explained by much stronger emission of the parasitic signal into
substrate of the via-less designs, illustrated with Fig. 10(a).

The techniques for simulation-driven design of antennas are discussed. The presented approaches are general
because they exploit low-fidelity models obtained through coarse-discretization EM simulations. Such models are
available for all conceivable antenna structures. Because of shifting the optimization burden to the low-fidelity
model, it is possible to obtain the optimized designs at a low computational cost corresponding to a few high-fidelity
full-wave electromagnetic simulations of the antenna structure of interest. Antenna design examples demonstrated
computational efficiency of the described design optimization techniques.
