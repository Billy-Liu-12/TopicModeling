Abstract. For typical initial and boundary conditions, a group of general
solutions for the generation and dissipation of excess pore water pressure in
stone column composite foundation under coupling action of dynamic and static
loads have been developed by separation of variables and Green functions to
the control differential equations. In the control equation, the pore pressure
increasing ratio is expressed as the function of depth and time. A special
solution is obtained to zero initial condition and upper boundary pervious,
based on an existing dynamic pore pressure calculation model. The numerical
example shows that the effect of seepage of the stone column is prominent.
Keywords: Stone Column; Pore Pressure; Dynamic; Drain; Liquefaction.

1 Introduction
The liquefaction of saturated sand generated by earthquake loading does tremendous
damage to engineering structures. As one of anti-liquefaction reinforcement methods,
stone column composite foundation has been widely used in engineering practice. In some
cases, it may be the unique choice of foundation reinforcement strategy.
In order to understand the behavior of stone column composite foundation during
earthquake, it is important to investigate the production, growth and dissipation of
the pore water pressure in the sand deposit under the action of dynamic loads. The
ordinary approach to deal with this problem is to adopt the Terzaghi’s or Biot’s
consolidation theory, combined with a selected dynamic pore pressure models. For
most of these approaches, numerical discretization is usually required in
engineering applications. This may cost a great deal of computational effort. The
alternative consideration is to seek analytical or semi-numerical computational
methods. Some researchers have contributed to this problem.

Seed & Booker (1976) [1, 2] proposed a analytical solution for the dynamic pore
water pressure formula to an asymmetric saturated sand model by combining
Terzaghi’s consolidation equations and a nonlinear increase model for pore water
pressure induced by vibrations. The dissipation of water happens only in horizontal
direction.
Xu (1985) [3] proposed a analytical solution to dynamic pore water pressure in
saturated sand improved by stone columns, where the drainage occurs only in the
radius direction. In 1992, Xu [4] extended his solutions to the situations where
dissipation appears in both the horizontal (radius) and vertical directions and found
that the vertical dissipation contributes a tremendous part in saturated sand during
earthquake action.
Huang (1992) [5] proposed a simplified analytical solution in uniform strain
condition with ignoring the well resistance of stone columns to the seepage.
In this paper, the solutions are extended to generalize pore water pressure model.

2 Equations and Solutions
It is assumed that the seepage of the porous water through sand is governed by the
Darcy’s law and the porous water is incompressible. The coefficient of permeability
and the coefficient of compression of sand keep constant. The coefficient of
permeability of stone column is large enough to neglect its resistance to seepage.
By the continuous condition of porous water flow, the control differential equation
can be written in cylindrical coordinate system as following:

∂u
∂ 2u 1 ∂u
∂ 2u ∂u
(1)
= Cvr ( 2 +
) + Cv 2 + g .
∂t
∂r
r ∂r
∂z
∂t
Where u is the excess pore pressure. r is the distance from the center of stone
column. u g is the dynamic pore pressure generated by vibrations. Cvr and Cv are the
horizontal and vertical consolidation coefficients.
General solutions can be obtained by solving equation (1) by variable separation
method and Green functions. When the initial pore water pressure is zero and only the
upper boundary is free of drainage, the solutions for the generation and dissipation of
excess pore water pressure in sand deposit improved by stone column can be
expressed as following:

It can be found that the solution form depends on the dynamic pore water pressure
model of u g . To illustrate the principal behavior of stone columns, the following
dynamic pore water pressure model [6] is adopted:

3 Numerical Example
A site is composed of silty sand of 8m thick. The diameter and space of the stone
column are 0.6m and 2.0m separately. The other parameters are shown in Table 1.

Substituting equation (6) into (5), special solution can be obtained and the
numerical results are shown in Fig. 1 to Fig. 4.
It is shown from these figures that the maximum pore pressure occurs in the
intermediate depth (Fig. 1). The pore pressure decreases with closing to the column in
depth of 1m and 5m (Fig.2 and 3). The effect of stone column decreases with depth in
the conditions that only upper boundary is free of drainage (Fig.4).

4 Conclusions
The effect of seepage of the stone column is prominent. The maximum pore pressure
occurs in the intermediate depth. The excess pore pressure increases with the distance
to the stone column. The effects of stone column decrease with depth when the lower
boundary is impervious.
