Abstract
In this paper, we will present ongoing work on using a dynamic data driven application system (DDDAS) based approach to the
forecast of volcanic ash transport and dispersal. Our primary modeling tool will be a new code puﬃn formed by the combination
of a plume eruption model Bent and the ash transport model Puff. Data from satellite imagery, observation of vent parameters
and windﬁelds will drive our simulations. We will use ensemble based uncertainty quantiﬁcation and parameter estimation
methodology – polynomial chaos quadrature in combination with data integration to complete the DDDAS loop.
Keywords: DDDAS ; Volcanic Ash Transport ; Uncertainty Quantiﬁcation

1. Introduction
Dynamic data driven application system paradigm (DDDAS) [1, 2] are systems where data are dynamically integrated into simulation (or simulation driven workﬂows) to enhance the model outcomes, and, where conversely
the executing simulation steers the observation process. We describe here ongoing work on the development of a
DDDAS for forecasting ash clouds produced by explosive eruptions from volcanoes. Crucial to the DDDAS process are eﬃcient means of dealing with the uncertainty associated with models and parameters, and the observation
data – a process for assimilating the outcomes of observation, a process for guiding the same and systematically informing the inputs of models by an estimation process complete the DDDAS loop. In an appendix here, we review
basic characteristics of the phenomena and modeling. It is immediately obvious that for the large scale natural
events studied here, constraining the models and parameters is diﬃcult and needs us to make careful assessment
of the uncertainty inherent in the process.
Our proposed techniques will greatly improve the quality of information available on the potential location and
concentrations of the ash clouds. We will provide probabilistic estimates of the hazard from volcanic ash. Current

The key to success in this workﬂow are the propagation of uncertainty – in parameters (vent radius, vent
velocity, mean grain size and grain size variance ) and source terms (wind ﬁeld) and assimilation with data from
satellites and other observations. The DDDAS components are in the systematic update of inputs, models and
modeling parameters and interpretation of observations in a probabilistic framework.
2.1. Uncertainty and Stochastic Variability
Dealing with uncertainty requires a multi phase approach. First is a careful identiﬁcation of the sources of
uncertainty in the primary model used – a model for volcanic ash transport and dispersal named Puff from
Tanaka [6] and Searcy et al. [7] and an attempt to ensure that we minimize sensitivity of outcome to modeling
assumptions (see Appendix A for details). Traditional input to the model is a poorly characterized mass eruption
column. To make the uncertainty analysis process more reliable, we introduce a novel coupling of an eruption
column model Bent and the aforementioned Puff tool as our simulation tool inside a DDDAS loop. This makes
the model inputs to be vent velocity and vent diameter that are directly observable and much easier to deal with. 2
We then characterize the uncertainty in the model inputs and propagate it through the model. Our core approach
to propagating the uncertainty in the model outcomes is to use weighted ensembles of the puﬃn model as our
simulation tool inside a DDDAS loop. Infrared and visual satellite imagery provide data on the position of ash
clouds though disambiguation needs a carefully constructed process wherein all information is used to identify ash
clouds. The observations are used in a system identiﬁcation loop to improve the estimates of the input uncertainty.
Uncertainty arises from several sources – the lack of knowledge of the input parameters to puﬃn such as vent
diameter, vent velocity, mean grain size and windﬁeld. Most of the literature [8–12] focuses on tracking the ash
material plume while making use of the sensitivity information of plume location to measured material ﬂux or
concentration. While a detailed sensitivity analysis can relate the variations in input parameters to ash cloud,
uncertainty analysis assesses the conﬁdence of predictions based on all available information. Thus the main
outcome of our work here is to “to provide a prediction of ash cloud motion, together with a quantitative measure
of the variability of that prediction, informed by all available data in real time.” [Note: By “real time”, we mean
a prediction of cloud motion 12-24 hours in advance, taking no more than 6 hours from initiation to completion.]
To discuss uncertainty and its eﬀects in models, we distinguish between parametric uncertainty and wind ﬁeld
forcing uncertainty. Methodologically, these two kinds of uncertainty are accounted for diﬀerently. However there
is not a perfect demarcation between the way we treat these. In a deterministic setting, ash concentration at a
given time and location is based on integration of advected Puff particles. In developing a probabilistic forecast
for the ash concentration at a given time and location, we treat the concentration at a given location and time
as a random variable and each “run” of the puﬃn simulation is a sample from that random variable, xk . The
time evolution of the vector of xk s, is given by a stochastic diﬀerential equation (which should be thought of as
generalization of Eq. (A.1) to include the physics of the Bent-Puff coupling):
xk+1 = f(tk , xk , Θ) + ηk ,

x(t0 ) = x¯ 0

(1)

In this equation, Θ represents uncertain but time-invariant system parameters such as the coeﬃcient of gravity
fallout, vent diameter or vent velocity. The random function ηk represents stochastic forcing terms, such as
turbulent diﬀusion, or any stochastic eﬀect that might be added to the windﬁeld. These random functions may be
modeled as a Gaussian process with speciﬁed correlation function Qk . The nominal initial position of the center
of the particles is given by x¯ 0 , which may also be uncertain. The total uncertainty associated with the state vector
xk is characterized by the probability distribution function (pdf) p(tk , xk , Θ) whose time evolution characterizes
our uncertainty.
Several approximate techniques are commonly used to approximate the state pdf evolution [13, 14], the most
popular being Monte Carlo (MC) methods [15], Gaussian closure [16], Equivalent Linearization [17], and Stochastic Averaging [18, 19]. In addition, a Gaussian Process approach to solve nonlinear stochastic diﬀerential equations has been proposed in [20]. All of these algorithms except MC methods are similar in several respects, and
are suitable only for linear or moderately nonlinear systems, because the eﬀect of higher order terms can lead
2 As an useful product of this eﬀort the composite tool is now available for public use as puﬃn on our vhub.org portal, where it can be used
by the over 1300 volcanologists registered to that portal.

to signiﬁcant errors. Monte Carlo methods require extensive computational resources and eﬀort, and become increasingly infeasible for high-dimensional dynamic systems [21] and the limited and time bound response needed
in DDDAS settings. Finally, a weighted ensemble approach, detailed below, appears to have the simplicity and
robustness of the MC methods, while producing uncertainty analysis of high quality for many systems.
The next two subsections discuss our currently deployed methods for solving the time evolution of state pdf
for systems that include model parameter and forcing wind ﬁeld uncertainty.
2.1.1. Parameter Uncertainty Propagation
The propagation of uncertainty due to time-invariant but uncertain input parameters can be approximated
by a generalized polynomial chaos (gPC), originally due to Xiu and Karniadakis [22]. Roughly speaking, gPC
postulates a separation of random variables from deterministic ones in the solution algorithm for a diﬀerential
equation. The random variables are expanded in terms of a polynomial basis, a proper choice of polynomials being
associated with the assumed probability distribution for the input variables (for example, Hermite polynomials for
normally distributed parameters, or Legendre for uniform distribution). Galerkin collocation is used to generate
a system of coupled, deterministic diﬀerential equations for the expansion coeﬃcients. The gPC collocation step
fails when applied to problems with non-polynomial nonlinearities (like those in the transport equations implicit
in the puﬃn model), and can produce non-physical solutions when applied to hyperbolic equations.
Non-intrusive spectral projection (NISP) or stochastic collocation methods can overcome these diﬃculties
[23–25]. We will use a formulation of the NISP idea introduced in our earlier work [26] that we call polynomial
chaos quadrature (PCQ). PCQ replaces the projection step of NISP with numerical quadrature. The resulting
method can be viewed as a Monte-Carlo-like evaluation of (1), but with sample points selected by quadrature
rules – a weighted ensemble with the weights and samples optimized to minimize error in the computation of
moments. The identiﬁcation with an underlying gPC expansion can be used to evaluate an approximation of the
pdf. The choice of quadrature rule for our work here are the Clenshaw-Curtis points [27] and a very promising
new method called a Conjugate Unscented Transform (CUT)[28]. The puﬃn model contains both stochastic
forcing and parametric uncertainty. We assume the parametric uncertainty is independent of the forcing terms,
and propose wrapping the PCQ quadrature evaluation outlined above around a characterization of the uncertainty
in forcing.
2.1.2. Uncertainty Propagation due to Stochastic Forcing by Wind
Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models (e.g. the Weather Research Forecast (WRF) System ) solve
a system of 3-dimensional conservation equations of mass, momentum and energy in the atmosphere at given
locations on a spatial grid. The numerical model solves the system of equations to provide a forecast of wind
velocity, temperature, pressure and precipitation for a future time. Since NWP processes do not capture the
smallest scales, there will always be a degree of error in the model forecast for any NWP system. Due to large
dependence on initial conditions, small diﬀerences (in initial conditions) may lead to large diﬀerences in the
forecasts. Ash transport forecasts will clearly be perturbed by perturbations in wind speed forecasts (see appendix
on Puff). NWP models also make many assumptions on the physics and boundary conditions. Depending on
choice of modeling assumptions – signiﬁcantly diﬀerent forecast outcomes are possible.
Given the error and uncertainty for windﬁelds described above, ensemble methods are considered to be an
eﬀective way to estimate the probability density function of future states of the atmosphere by addressing uncertainties present in initial conditions, unresolved scales and in model approximations. During the last few decades,
much eﬀort has been devoted to study and improve the methods used for the preparation of the initial conditions
for numerical atmospheric models, as well as to understand the mechanisms involved in the growth of the initial
errors. Lorentz [29] demonstrated that the diﬀerence between the modeled atmospheric states may grow larger as
the model runs are each integrated forward in time. This observation was implemented into the National Center
for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Ensemble Forecasting System (GEFS) single-model, global ensemble by Toth[30] to simulate uncertainty on initial conditions. This was called “breeding vectors” method, and is
based on the idea that a random initial perturbation is carried forward in time non linearly at full resolution and
re-scaled and used to perturb the analysis in the next cycle which is then re-scaled and recycled to perturb the
analysis in the following cycle and so on. After a number of cycles, only the fastest growing modes remain. The
publicly available version of NCEP GEFS ensembles consists of 21 members and is run 4 times daily (0000, 0600,

1200, and 1800 UTC) out to 384-h (16 day) lead time. The underlying model for the GEFS is the NCEP Global
Forecasting System (GFS), a high-resolution spectral atmospheric model run 4 times daily at the Environmental
Modeling Center. The GFS analysis is spectrally truncated and interpolated to a lower resolution analysis which
then serves as the control analysis for the ensemble. The analysis ﬁeld for each member forecast is created by
applying a small perturbation to the control analysis. The present perturbation method used by NCEP is referred
to as the ensemble-transform bred-vector technique developed by [31].
The ensembles of the NWP are now combined with the PCQ weighted ensembles used to account for the
source uncertainty. We use GEFS ensemble as WRF input and then the forecast ensemble is used as input for
Puff. Output statistics are then computed by properly summing the weighted values of the output parameters
of interest. The results are presented as forecast envelope and show how volcanic source term uncertainty and
windﬁeld stochastic variability can simultaneously aﬀect the forecast. Such a probabilistic forecast has not been
available in the past for operation.
2.2. Data Assimilation and Source Estimation
Of course using any sensor data that might become available to correct and reﬁne the dynamical model forecast
will reduce the uncertainty of predictions. This model-data fusion process is well documented in meteorology
applications where a variety of data assimilation methods are used operationally to improve the quality of the
NWP forecast [32–35]. Satellite image based ash observations which are available at every 6 hours are used for

satellite images tracking the cloud are available, as is plume data (for example, there is Meteosat SEVIRI data on
ash loading and plume height, and SEVIRI and CALIPSO data showing the motion of the cloud). Comparison to
this data provides us a good way to illustrate our methods. The ash cloud height were retrieved using an optimal
estimation approach [40] and [41]. We present here three types of analysis. First, we present the probabilistic ash
forecast and present some results on the eﬀect of diﬀerent choices of numerical wind prediction. We follow up
with results from a source estimation result to improve the estimates of source parameters.
In earlier work (reproduced here in Fig. 2a) we reported on source uncertainty and its use in a probabilistic
forecast [42]. Four puﬃn inputs (vent radius, vent velocity, mean grain size, and grain size variance) were considered as uncertain, and PCQ was employed as a solution methodology. In Fig. 2b we show here for the ﬁrst time
the eﬀect of the NWP variability in addition to the source uncertainty. Along with the windﬁelds, we consider the source parameters (vent radius, vent velocity, mean grain size and grain size variance) as major sources
of uncertainties (see Table 1). The 21 NCEP GEFS member ensembles are available every six hours, starting
0000 UTC April 14 to 0000 UTC April 18 at 1◦ latitude by 1◦ longitude grid. We use each member as WRF input,
keeping the physics and dynamics options the same for all the runs. In this way, we aim to capture the dependency
on initial conditions that can lead to large diﬀerences in the forecasts. The eﬀect of wind variability can also be
seen in Fig. 3 where we show the probability of ash forecast for select members of the ensemble of WRF used in
driving puﬃn.
Finally, we show the eﬀect of using the observed satellite imagery to improve the source parameter estimates.
Prior and Posterior distribution of source parameters are shown in Fig. 4. It is clearly shown in Fig. 4 that using
the measurement data results in reduction of uncertainty involved in source parameters. To validate the obtained
values for uncertain source parameters, satellite data at two consecutive times were used to ﬁnd the posterior
estimate of source parameters. Then, posterior value of source parameters were used to resimulate the puﬃn
model. We have run the model using both prior and posterior mean value of source parameters and have compared
the resulted ash top-height with actual satellite image. As Fig. 5 shows, the simulation obtained from posterior
estimate of source parameters precisely corresponds well to satellite data, while there are signiﬁcant discrepancies
between the simulation using the prior estimate of source parameters and satellite data.
In summary, basic tools for probabilistic forecasts of volcanic ash transport and dispersal based on numerical
model puﬃn and observations of eruption source parameters and satellite imagery are in place. Early results in
hindcasting the Eyjafjallaj¨okull eruptions have been very successful.

4. Future Directions
Much work remains on solving challenges in uncertainty analysis, managing the workﬂow for eﬃcient operations, interpreting and integrating satellite observations and delivering a “real time” capability. An alternative
to propagating the uncertainty using ensemble is a direct time integration of the pdf. Such a method outlined
here is under consideration though not yet implemented. Consider ﬁrst Eq. (1) for ﬁxed system parameters Θ0 ,
and a stochastic forcing η. In the context of the Bent-Puff model, this assumption is akin to ﬁxing all input
parameters but allowing for a random component the windﬁeld. The time evolution of the pdf from time-step k
to time-step k + 1 is given by the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation (CKE) [43–45] The CKE is a diﬃcult to solve
since the constraints of positivity, unit volume preservation (probability) and the changing domain. A recently developed adaptive Gaussian mixture model (AGMM) in conjunction with information theoretic measures [46, 47]
has shown promise in accurately solving the CKE. Additionally, we will also focus on eﬀective workﬂows to
implement our procedures in an operational setting in partnership with the AVO.

Appendix A. Puff and Bent
Volcanic Ash Transport and Dispersion Models (VATDMs) are used by aviation or meteorological agencies
to provide forecasts of ash cloud motion [48, 49]. In this paper, we based our work on a VATDM named Puff
that is used by Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) and Anchorage Volcanic Ash Advisory Center (VAAC) for
real-time civil aviation forecasts. Tanaka [6] and Searcy et al. [7] developed Puff for predicting the paths of
volcanic clouds at meso- and synoptic scales. Puff simpliﬁes the eruption plume to a vertical source, and uses a
Lagrangian pseudo-particle representation of the ash cloud in a detailed 3-D regional windﬁeld to determine the
trajectory of the cloud.
Unlike other VATD models, it is designed solely for predictions of ash-cloud movement in space and time,
and it generates displays that can be tailored to user needs at volcano observatories, in a real-time setting during
an eruption crisis. For these reasons, Puff is necessarily simple by design. The model takes into account the
predominant physical processes that control particle movement, such as winds, dispersion and settling, but it
does not account for small scale physical processes that play a lesser role like poorly understood inter-particle
interactions, expensive to model radiative heating and poorly characterized precipitation.
Puff can be run using one of several numerical weather prediction (NWP) windﬁelds [50–53]. These NWP
models are available at diﬀering levels of spatial and temporal resolution; local use of the WRF (Weather Research
Forecast) model will allow for customizing the model domains used for veriﬁcation and validation. Puff tracks a
ﬁnite number of Lagrangian point particles of diﬀerent sizes, whose location R is propagated from timestep k to
timestep k + 1 via an advection/diﬀusion equation
Ri (tk+1 ) = Ri (tk ) + W(tk )Δt + Z(tk )Δt + S i (tk )Δt

(A.1)

Here Ri (tk ) is the position vector of the ith particle at time kΔt, W(tk ) is the local wind velocity at the location of
the ith particle, Z(tk ) is a turbulent diﬀusion that is modeled as a random walk, and S i (tk ) is a source term which
models the fallout of the ith particle due to gravity.
The Bent integral eruption column model will be used to produce eruption column parameters (mass loading,
column height, grain size distribution) given a speciﬁc atmospheric sounding and source conditions [54]. Bent
takes into consideration atmospheric (wind) conditions as given by atmospheric sounding data. Thus plume rise
height is given as a function of volcanic source and environmental conditions.
