Abstract. The purpose of this paper is to present a new method of the
partial fraction decomposition, the so called ”three brick method”. The
method is of algebraic nature and it is based on simple reduction tasks.
The discussed algorithm has been successfully implemented in Mathematica software package.

Introduction

The partial fraction decomposition is a very important topic in symbolic and
computational mathematics, for example in inverse Laplace transform. ”The
residuum method” which is commonly applied to ﬁnd the inverse Laplace transform, although very legible from the theoretical point of view, turns out as very
tedious from the computational point of view (especially if the calculations are
ﬁnally meant to get rid of the complex notation). The latter often tends to be
”the bottleneck” in the whole process of calculating the inverse Laplace transform. Thus, an alternative method of the decomposition of rational functions
into partial fractions has evolved considerable interest [2].
In the paper a new method of the partial fraction decomposition, called here
”three brick method”, is discussed. It is a simple and very eﬃcient method of
the decomposition of rational functions:
W (s) =

as + b
s2 + αs + β s2 + γs + δ

(1)

into partial fractions. It is a decomposition method of pure algebraic nature and
is based on simple reduction tasks.

Three Brick Method

Let α, β, γ, δ ∈ C, α = γ. The case of α = γ is expressed in formula (14). Let
us put:
M2 := s2 + γs + δ
(2)
M1 := s2 + αs + β ,

The next step is to eliminate the summands containing s2 from the numerators
of the fraction at the right side of equations IIeq and IIIeq , thus the fourth
equation is generated (IVeq := IIeq − (γ − α) IIIeq ):

Remark. The following equivalent equations hold:

⇔

δα2 − γ(δ + β)α + γ 2 β + (δ − β)2 = 0 ,

(10)

concurrently, the discriminant of the last polynomial of the second order, in
consideration of variable α (assuming that δ = 0) has the following form:
∆α = (γ 2 − 4δ)(δ − β)2 .

(11)

Accordingly ∆α < 0, if, and only if, the discriminant of the trinomial M2 is
negative and if β = δ. The case of β = δ is expressed in formulas:

Algorithm in Mathematica

The algorithm discussed in the previous section will next be implemented in
Mathematica [1, 3]. The summands connected with trinomials M1 and M2 shall
be expressed in separate notations, so that the transformations are performed
separately on both fractions. We start with deﬁning the trinomials:
In[1]:= m1 = s2 + α s + β; m2 = s2 + γ s + δ;

Let us form three equations (Ieq , IIeq , IIIeq ):
In[2]:= eq1 = {1/m1, −1/m2};
eq2 = {s/m1, −s/m2};
eq3 = {2/m1, −1/m2};

The summands containing s2 are eliminated (IVeq ):
In[3]:= eq4 = Simplify[eq2 − (γ − α)eq3]
s+2α−2γ
s+α−γ
Out[3]=

Conclusion

In this paper a new method of the partial fraction decomposition, the three brick
method, is presented. It is a simple and eﬀective method of an algebraic nature,
based on simple reduction procedures. The discussed algorithm has successfully
been used in Mathematica software package. The advantage of the method is
the possibility to perform computations for symbolic data, which is not always
possible by using the standard Mathematica commands (Apart).
