Abstract. This paper introduces a distributed publication alerting service which
increases the amount of information in notification message while using
information hiding principle. It is aimed to design a mobile agent based
publication alerting system (MABPAS) which uses mobile agents to dispatch
notification information (generally all text information) about produced
publication to subscribers. MABPAS combines the advantages of
publish/subscribe communication model and mobile agents into a flexible and
extensible distributed execution environment.

1 Introduction
Publication alert is an interactive feature that makes it possible for authors and
publishers to directly post notification to an information dissemination system (like
mail groups or dispatching services) about recently published works. This approach
makes subscribers of the system aware of recent publications. To alert more
subscribers it is necessary to put more information to notification message.
Publication alerting systems are used to provide online platform for keeping
subscribers to be informed about any publication in a new issue of a journal,
magazine, newsletter or proceedings. Publications can be either scientific publications
like technical reports, conference papers, journal papers, books or social publications
like novels, adventure books and magazines. In most of the previous works,
notifications about publications are performed by mailing lists with limited
expressiveness and functionality. To improve the efficiency of the alerting system we
developed a mobile agent based publication alerting service (MABPAS) which takes
advantage of mobile agents to dispatch necessary information (generally all text
information) about produced publication to subscribers. MABPAS uses the execution
environment of an agent based distributed event system [1] which uses mobile agents
as event messages (called as agvent(agent event)).

2 Publication Alerting System
MABPAS implements the publish/subscribe protocol, thus enabling many-to-many
interaction of loosely coupled entities. It also allows publishers and subscribers to

dynamically connect and disconnect from the system, a capability that extends the
flexibility of the working environment. Two properties of MABPAS make it
distinctive from other alerting systems:
• Autonomy: the agent structure of the publication agvents represents both the
capabilities (ability to compute something, to decide target nodes) and the preferences
over how these capabilities can be used. Thus, publication agvents have the ability to
reason about how they use their resources and selects target subscribers by using
knowledgebase of the brokers. These brokers are called as agvent servers whose main
role is providing an execution platform for publication agvents.
• Conversation-Negotiation: since the agvents are autonomous, they must negotiate
with other stationary agents to gain access to their resources and capabilities. It is
important to hide information in the agvent structure; therefore both agvent
servers(ASs) and subscribers cannot see information in it. At the same time, agvents
cannot reach directly to the resources of ASs. Agvents can obtain necessary
information for their routing operations by talking with stationary agent of an AS.
Communication with the subscriber is a little bit different. There is no forwarding
operation after arriving on a subscriber. Therefore a publication agvent does not need
to talk with the subscriber’s stationary agent. However a subscriber agent has to
communicate with the incoming publication agvent to get necessary information. To
accomplish this subscriber agent follows a "conversation sequence", where multiple
messages are exchanged according to some pre-defined protocols.

Fig. 1. Dispatching Mechanism of MABPAS

MABPAS consists of four main components as depicted in Figure 1;
1. Publishers are components which produce publications and publish their relevant
agvents to the alerting system (i.e. publishing houses or singular authors).
2. Subscribers are the consumers of the system like libraries, researchers, academic
staff or students. They issue subscriptions/profiles that describe the publications/
agvents they want to receive.
3. Agvents are created by publishers according to relevant publications and they are
the main components of the system. A publication agvent is a collection of code and

data (generally all text information of the publication) that migrates through the
dispatch service. Dispatch service is comprised of a network of distributed nodes and
an agvent routes itself at each node on the path towards its target subscribers. The
agvent structure of MABPAS is named as PublicationAgvent which contains
attributes and behaviors of the relevant publication. These properties are used for
establishing an efficient filtering mechanism. PublicationAgvent is a class definition
which contains not only the filterable attributes like publisher_name, publish_date,
pages, authors, publication_name, list_price…etc but also filterable methods like
ReferenceContains(String AuthorName), TOCContains(String topic), WholesalePrice
(int amount,String destination)…etc. The filtering process of the system is the
keystone of the alerting service. System enables subscribers to subscribe on both the
publication agvents’ attributes and methods. By using this type filtering mechanism; it
is possible to compose complex subscriptions, message traffic of system is reduced,
and dispatching of irrelevant messages is prevented.
There are also some methods which are used for conversation with subscribers.
These methods are not filterable methods and therefore they are not advertised. These
methods are used by publication agvent according to subscribers’ requests.
4. Agvent Server processes incoming subscriptions and advertisements according to a
protocol which includes their propagation to adjacent/neighbor ASs. Agvents are selfrouting, that is, they are responsible for determining their own paths through the
network, utilizing a minimal set of facilities provided by ASs. ASs support incoming
agvents by providing a simple, architecturally independent environment for the
receipt and execution of publication agvents. An AS has no access to the content of
the published agvent, which simplifies its role and consequently facilitates the server
development process. Information hiding principle also meets confidentiality of
publication information.

3 Performance Evaluation
We’ve selected average publication (agvent) distribution time as an appropriate
benchmark for evaluating performance of MABPAS. To calculate this we use a
network with properties as shown in Table 1.a and we dispatch a publication agvent
with the properties as shown in Table 1.b.

We define distribution time as the elapsed time from the generation of a publication
agvent to its reception by all subscribers that are interested in that agvent type. In our
analysis, agvent generation is the submission of a publication agvent to an AS. In our
preliminary analysis, we established an objective of determining the efficiency of the
AS delivery without incurring concurrency into the system. Our goal was to examine
the performance and scalability of the alerting system.

Dispatching of an agvent is directly related with its size. It changes according to
agvent’s type and the data it contains. Table 2 shows the change in agvent size
relative to number of words in a publication.

Fig. 2. Experimental Results for Agvent Transfer Times

To compile realistic network topologies that approximate the behavior of real
wide-area networks, we used a generator of random network graphs that implements
the Transit-Stub model [2] with 100 agvent servers. We ran a simple benchmark with
a single publisher and a multiple number of subscribers, which were distributed
evenly on this alerting service. As we were sure that there was no concurrent agvent
delivery, we could compute the theoretical best average delivery time. Figure 2.a
shows agvent transfer times between two ASs relative to agvent sizes. Figure 2.b
shows agvent distribution time in MABPAS with previously mentioned system
parameters for different average hops between publishers and subscribers.
