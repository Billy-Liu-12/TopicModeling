Abstract. A three dimensional hydrodynamic and suspended sediment transport
model (HYDROTAM-3) has been developed and applied to Fethiye Bay.
Model can simulate the transport processes due to tidal or nontidal forcing
which may be barotropic or baroclinic. The Boussinesq approximation, i.e. the
density differences are neglected unless the differences are multiplied by the
gravity, is the only simplifying assumption in the model. The model is also capable of computing suspended sediment distributions, amount of eroded and
deposited sediment. It is a composite finite difference, finite element model. At
three Stations in the Bay, continuous measurements of velocity throughout the
water depth and water level were taken for 27 days. Model predictions are in
good agreement with the field data.

1 Introduction
The activities around enclosed or semi-enclosed coastal areas that have limited water
exchange should be carefully planned and detailed researches to understand water
circulations and transport processes should be performed. Since field measurements
are usually costly and some times impossible due to physical inabilities, application of
numerical models becomes more and more important in the simulations of coastal
water bodies. Use of three-dimensional models is unavoidable in all cases where the
influence of density distribution, or the vertical velocity variations can not be neglected and in the simulation of wind induced circulation [1],[2],[3]. The detailed
knowledge of the water motion is very crucial for a reliable prediction of suspended
sediment transport [4],[5].
An unsteady three-dimensional baroclinic circulation model (HYDROTAM-3) has
been developed to simulate the transport processes in coastal water bodies[6],[7],[8].
The model consists of three components: hydrodynamic, turbulence and suspended
sediment transport models. In the hydrodynamic model, full Navier-Stokes equations
are solved. The Boussinesq approximation is the only simplifying assumption in the
hydrodynamic model. Temperature and salinity variations are calculated by solving
the three dimensional convection-diffusion equations. The two equation k-ε turbulence model is used for the turbulence modelling [6],[7]. The three dimensional conservation equation for suspended sediment where the vertical advection includes the
particle settling velocity can be written as:

Solution scheme is a composite finite element-finite difference scheme [6]. The
governing equations are solved by Galerkin Weighted Residual Method in the vertical
plane and by finite difference approximations in the horizontal plane, without any
coordinate transformation. The water depths are divided into the same number of
layers following the bottom topography.

2 Model Application to Fethiye Bay
Developed three dimensional numerical model (HYROTAM-3) has been implemented to the Bay of Fethiye. Water depths in the Bay are plotted in Fig.1. The grid
system used has a square mesh size of 100x100 m. Wind characteristics are obtained
from the measurements of the meteorological station in Fethiye for the period of
1980-2002. The wind analysis shows that the critical wind direction for wind speeds
more than 7 m/s, is WNW-WSW direction.

Some field measurements have been performed in the area. At Station I and at Station II shown in Fig.1, continuous velocity measurements throughout water depth, at
Station III water level measurements were taken for 27 days. Simulated velocity profiles over the depth at the end of 8.5 days are compared with the measurements taken
at Station I and Station II and are shown in Fig.2.
At the end of 8.5 days of simulation, for Station I, the root mean square error is
0.417 cm/s and bias is –0.095 cm/s. and for Station II, the root mean square error is
0.182 cm/s and bias is –0.027 cm/s. Comparison of results is encouraging. Model well
simulates the measurement period. Predicted sediment distributions in the Bay are
given in Fig.3. at the end of 8.5 days of simulation.

A sensitivity study of model predictions to bottom friction coefficient is performed
and Cf=0.0026 provided the best match with the measurements. In the application,
measurement period has been simulated and model is forced by the recorded
wind. No significant density stratification was recorded at the site. A horizontal grid
spacing of Δx=Δy=100 m. is used. The sea bottom is treated as a rigid boundary.
Model predictions are in good agreement with the measurements. During the site
investigations, it has been observed that suspended sediment concentration is the
highest around the island. Inner and outer parts of the Bay are rather dynamic regions
where there may occur sediment deposition or resuspension depending on the blowing
wind direction. Model simulations well agree to the observed regions at the site.
Sediment sampling studies are still in continuation at the site.

3 Conclusions
A baroclinic three dimensional numerical model of transport processes in coastal areas
has been presented. The model consists of three components; hydrodynamic, turbulence and suspended sediment transport. The developed model is able to predict suspended sediment concentration profiles, re-suspension of bottom sediments, equilibrium and deposition sites of the coastal area and determines changes in sea bed morphology quantitatively. Model has been applied to Fethiye Bay where there exist some
field measurements. Model implementation to Fethiye Bay has provided realistic
results and has shown the capability of model to predict complex circulation patterns.
