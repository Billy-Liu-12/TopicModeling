are codes defined over finite rings of integers. These codes enable lower complexity decoding
and in contrast to the traditional block codes they are designed to correct errors of a given
type. It means that for a given channel and modulator we can construct integer code capable
to correct the type of errors, which are the most common for this channel.
An upper and a lower bounds for symbol error probability (SER) in the case of AWGN
channel, both in uncoded and coded with integer codes case, are derived in [2]. The exact
values of SER in uncoded case are computed in [7].
In this work we shall investigate the performance of coded modulation scheme based on the
application of integer codes to TQAM constellation with 22m points. Necessary definitions and
results are given in Section 2. In Section 3 we describe how to compute the exact value of SER
in the case of TQAM over AWGN channel coded by integer codes. Section 4 describes the
simulations that have been carried out.

Preliminaries
TQAM constellation

In this paper we consider TQAM constellation of M = 22m signal points placed in L = 2m
rows parallel to the horizontal axis with L signal point in each row. The signal points form
a lattice of equilateral triangles with side equals 2d and the constellation
is symmetric with
√
respect to the origin. The distance between horizontal rows is h = d 3 (which is the altitude
of the of equilateral triangles). The average energy per signal point Es and the parameter d
are connected by the equation ([9])

The dominated form of detection regions is hexagon with side equals a = 2d/ 3 (the regions
of contour points are more complex). The 64-TQAM constellation with the different type of

For M = 16, 64, 256 the power gain is 0.458, 0.5505 and 0.5726, respectively.
We consider an AWGN channel with power spectral density N0 watts/hertz. Hence if a signal
point s is sent through the channel the received signal r = s + n, where n is two dimensional
zero-mean Gaussian random process with variance σ 2 = N0 /2. At the other end of the channel
the detector estimates r and has to decide which signal point has been sent.
In this paper we use the error function to express the probability of normal distribution (the

Integer codes

Herein we give some necessary definitions and notations which we shall use in the next sections.
More details the reader can find in the mentioned papers.
Integer codes were proposed by Varshamov and Tenengolz [10] in 1965 for correcting single
insertion/deletion per codeword, but in [4, 5] it was demonstrated that such classes of codes
are very suitable for realization of coded modulation procedures. The applications of integer
codes with different modulation schemes, in partial with SQAM, are discussed also in [3, 6].
Definition 2.1. [5] Let ZA be the ring of integers modulo A. An integer code of length n
, is referred to as a subset of ZnA , defined by
with parity-check matrix H ∈ Zm×n

C(H, d) = {c ∈ ZnA | cH T = d mod A}

Figure 3: Several error detection regions in the case of coded 64-TQAM constellation

Assume that a signal point si of a given signal constellation is sent through an AWGNchannel. At the other end the detector estimates the received signal ri and gives signal point
sj at the output. If j = i the detector has taken a wrong decision. In terms of block codes
over ZA the aforesaid can be described in the following way. When a codeword c ∈ C(w, d)
is sent through a communication channel (usually noisy) the received vector can be written in
the form
r = c + e,
where e = (e1 , . . . , en ) ∈ ZnA denotes the error vector. It is clear that the different signal points
have not the same chance to be a result of decision process. The probability signal point sj
to appear at the output of the detector depends on the Euclidean distance between sj and
really-sent signal point si . In terms of codes over ZA it means that the elements of ZA are not
equally probable as a value taken by ei . Which elements of ZA are more probable depends on
the chosen indexing of the signal points by the elements of ZA . Therefore, it makes sense to
consider (there is a point in considering) the next definition.
Definition 2.2 [5] The code C(H, d) is a t-multiple (±e1 , ±e2 , . . . , ±es )-error correctable
if it can correct up to t errors with values from the set {±e1 , ±e2 , . . . , ±es } which are occurred
in a codeword.
Remark: Without loss of generality in the definitions above we can assume that d = 0.
For convenience of a notation we shall use C instead of C(H, 0).
To decode integer codes one can use a hard decoding algorithm [6]. This algorithm uses
a look-up table which maps each syndrome value to the corresponding error vector. So, the
complexity of the algorithm is linear with respect to the alphabet size A.

SER in coded case

We analyze 22m -TQAM modulations combined with integer error correcting codes. In the case
of 16-TQAM we use two codes over Z5 with a generator matrix H = (1, 2) and number the
points by pair of integers as it is shown in Figure 2: the first integer shows the horizontal row,
and the second number - the vertical see-saw line. This code is a single ±1-error correcting
code. Thus it can correct any case when the sent point is wrongly detected as one of its neighbor
(adjacent) points. In the case of 64-TQAM and 256-TQAM the code with the same matrix
H = (1, 2) but over Z9 and Z17 respectively, can be used.
The encoding procedure is the following. If we have to send the signal point (i, j) we sent
two points: (i, j) and (ai, aj) (multiplication is in ZA , i.e, modulo A = 5, 9 or 17), where
a = −1/2 in ZA . The pair (i, ai) and (j, aj) are codewords, thus the decoder can correct an
error of value ±1 in one of coordinate of each codeword.
In the coded case there are more number of different types of regions of correct detection
which are larger and more complex. In the Figure 3 five of the regions are depicted.
Let Q be the average (average on all regions Ai ) probability of correct detection and q be
the average probability for the uncoded case (average on all regions Di ). Since the code is single
error correcting the probability of correct decoding a codeword is 2qQ, thus the probability of
error decoding of a symbol is

SER = 1 − 2qQ.

(q is computed in [7])
We demonstrate the method of computing the probabilities Qi by determining the probability of correct detection Q1 for the simplest, but the dominating region A1 . Due to the symmetry
of Gaussian distribution A1 can be considered as an union of 12 congruent subregion (which
are triangles).

There are no principle difficulties to compute Q but the expressions are too complex, and
thus, not practical. The attempt to follow the same approach for BER will result in even more
complex expressions. Hence, we consider simulations of the described communication procedure
as a better approach. The availability of software for simulation enables more flexibility for
investigating the influence on the performance of chosen mapping and codes as well as for
changing the type of the channel.

Computer Simulations

We have developed a software that simulates communication in AWGN channel based on 16, 64
and 256-TQAMs in two variants: combined with the described in the previous section integer
codes with H = (1, 2) and without any coding. The chosen correspondence between signal
points and frame of 4, 6 or 8 bits does not affect decoding procedure and SER, but can increase
or decrease BER. It is not difficult to realize (guess) that the best results in uncoded case can
be obtained by using so called Grey mapping which is illustrate for 16-TQAM in Figure 4. In
this case the bit frame of any signal point differs only in one bit for four of the six closest points
and only in two bits for the others 2 points.
Another way of mapping between signal points of 22m -TQAM and binary 2m-tuples is to
use the correspondence between signal points and codewords. If the codeword ab corresponds
to a signal point s then āb̄ is the corresponding binary 2m-tuple, where ā and b̄ are the binary
representations of a and b with the stipulation that 2m is mapped to all-zeros m-tuple. For
example, the point numbered by 14 in Figure 2 corresponds to 0100. This correspondence we
refer to as ”standard ”
The Grey mapping does not decrease essentially BER in coded case (and simulations confirm
this fact) since in the most of cases the closets points belong to the region of right decoding.
Hence we prefer to use ”standard” mapping in the coded case.
The software generalizes a random sequence of bits, transforms it into a sequence of signal points according to the chosen mapping and adds to them AWGN corresponding to the
prescribed (input) SNR. Then carries out the procedure of detection (and decoding in the
coded case) and compare the obtained points with the sent ones to calculate the SER. Also,
the software transforms the sequence of detected (decoding) points into a sequence of bits and
calculates the BER. Three modes of simulation are realized:
• ’St’ - uncoded case with ”standard” mapping;
7

• ’grey’ - uncoded case with Grey mapping;
• ’intc’ - use of integer codes with H = (1, 2) and ”standard” mapping.
We carried out the simulations by generating pseudo-random sequences of length ≈ 1012 bits.
Then we divide it in blocks of 2m bits and transform each block in element of Z2m+1 \ {0}. Two
consecutive numbers in the new sequence correspond to one signal point (see Figure 2). Then
we encode each coordinate of the pair and produce a new (additional) signal point which is sent
on the channel, too. After adding noise we detect which signal point is sent (the decision can
be wrong) and carry out the described procedure in reverse order. Then compare the obtained
sequences of elements of Z2m+1 and sequences of bits with the original ones to compute SER
and BER. The next figures demonstrate the obtained results. Figure 5 and Figure 6 compare
SER in uncoded and coded case for 64-TQAM and 256-TQAM, respectively.

Figure 7: BER for coded 64-TQAM
The break of the curves shows that the probability of error drops down to zero (or less than
10−12 ) when SNR (in dB) reaches a given value (threshold). The existence of such a threshold
can be observed in all cases of coded by integer codes modulation. It is due to the presence of
double errors in a codeword (the code is single error correctable) when SNR is just less than
this threshold. For SNR greater than the threshold there are no double errors.
Figure 7 presents the BER versus SNR in dB but per bit in the case of coded 64-TQAM
and 256-TQAM. For larger values of SNR per bit the BER drops down to zero.

Conclusion

We have developed and describe a method for accomplishing coded TQAM and show how the
SER in this case can be determined. Also we developed a software that simulates the described
procedure in the case of AWGN channel. Indeed the type of the channel as well as codes and

mappings can be easily changed. This flexibility enables a wide range of experiments to be
carried out. Our further research will be in that direction.
