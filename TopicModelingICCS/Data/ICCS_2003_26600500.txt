Abstract. Multimedia applications are much more sensitive to the quality of
service(QoS) than text-based ones due to their data continuity. In order to provide a fast moving mobile host(MH) supporting multimedia applications with a
consistent QoS, an efficient call admission mechanism is in need. This paper
proposes the 2-level call admission control(2LCAC) scheme based on a call admission scheme using the priority to guarantee the consistent QoS for mobile
multimedia applications. The 2LCAC consists of the basic call admission and
advanced call admission; the former determines call admission based on bandwidth available in each cell and the latter determines call admission by utilizing
delay tolerance time(DTT), priority queue(PQueue), and upgrade
queue(UpQueue) algorithms. In order to evaluate the performance of our
scheme, we measure the metrics such as the blocking probability of new calls,
dropping probability of handoff calls, and bandwidth utilization. The result
shows that the performance of our scheme is superior to that of existing schemes
such as complete sharing policy(CSP), guard channel policy(GCP) and adaptive
guard channel policy(AGCP).

1 Introduction1
The provision of QoS in mobile multimedia networks becomes more complex due to
user mobility. The problem becomes even more challenging as recent wireless networks are constructed based on small-size cells(microcells or picocells). Small-size
cells increase the number of handoffs, which results in complex and rapid handling in
call admission control(CAC), thus increasing the handoff dropping rate.
It is important to reduce the dropping rate caused by lack of available bandwidth in
the handoff target cell. If the cell’s available bandwidth is not sufficient enough to
satisfy a handoff call, this call has to compete with other calls to acquire the bandwidth. To solve this problem, several schemes have been proposed in literature for
efficient channel assignment.

A Design and Performance Evaluation of 2-Level Call Admission Control Scheme

501

One well-known scheme is priority-based CAC and channel assignment. From the
user’s point of view, dropping an ongoing call is more undesirable than blocking a
new call[1],[2],[3]. As a result, many researches have been devoted to CAC and channel assignment using prioritized handoff requests. Another well-known scheme is
bandwidth reservation based CAC which reserves bandwidth for handoff calls in all or
some cells that MH might pass through, resulting in potentially lower bandwidth utilization and higher new call blocking probability.
In this paper, we propose the 2-level call admission control(2LCAC) scheme using
the priority to guarantee the consistent QoS for mobile multimedia applications. A cell
is assumed to be small and overlapped partially with its neighboring cells. MH calls
are classified into new calls, hand-off calls, and QoS upgrading calls. The 2LCAC
consists of two stages: basic call admission control(BCAC) and advanced call admission control(ACAC). The former determines call admission based on available bandwidth in each cell and the latter determines call admission by utilizaing delay tolerance time(DTT), priority queue(PQueue), and upgrade queue(UPQueue) algorithms
according to the type of call blocked at BCAC.
We compare the performance of 2LCAC scheme with that of the other CAC
schemes. Simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the others by satisfying
the constraint on call blocking probability of new calls(CBP), call dropping probability
of handoff calls(CDP) and bandwidth utilization.
This paper is organized as follows. We describe our CAC scheme in Section 2.
Section 3 shows simulation results and compares the performance of our scheme with
that of the other schemes under various scenarios. Finally, Section 4 contains the concluding remarks.

2 2LCAC Scheme Based on Priority Queue
Generally, it is assumed that a cell is hexagonal in mobile networks. However, in real
world, a cell is close to a circle, and there are overlapped areas with neighboring cells
as shown in Fig. 1. MHs residing in overlapped areas have higher possibility to move
to another cell than MHs not residing in those areas.

Fig. 2. 2LCAC Procedure

As shown in Fig. 2, 2LCAC consists of BCAC and ACAC. At the BCAC stage, each
call(new, handoff and QoS upgrading) requests required bandwidth from its base station(BS). That is, CAC is performed at the BCAC stage when a call is requested for the
first time from a specific cell. If available bandwidth of the BS satisfies each call’s
request, it assigns the bandwidth to the MH; otherwise, it blocks the call and passes its
control to the ACAC stage.

where B j is the total amount of bandwidth provided by cell j and n and m are the

In case of a new call, the CAC is triggered when MH requests the call admission. If

B j is larger than B i, the call is admitted; otherwise, blocked. In case of a handoff

call, the CAC is triggered when the MH enters an overlapped area. If the B j is larger

than B

CAC. If B j is larger than Thup, the call is accepted, where Thup is the threshold used
for determining the acceptance of QoS upgrading call; otherwise, blocked. The control
of blocked new, handoff and QoS upgrading call will be treated at the ACAC stage.

2.2 Advanced Call Admission Control (ACAC)
Priority Queue and QoS Upgrading Queue
In ACAC, each cell requires space to store information about MH: priority queue(PQ)
and QoS upgrading queue(UpQ). PQ stores information on an MH such as ID and the
priority that has been blocked as a result of BCAC for its handoff. For example, when
MH1 and MH2 move towards the overlapping area with cell D from cell C and E, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3, BCAC is triggered. If both MHs are blocked, the priorities of MH1 and MH2 are calculated by cell D’s BS and the information on those
blocked MHs are inserted into PQ. Furthermore, if an MH3 residing in cell D moves
towards cell B through the overlapped area between the two cells and is blocked as a
result of BCAC, the priority of MH3 is inserted into cell B’s PQ.

The call priority of MH is calculated using Eq. (2):

Call priority = w1 DP + w2TP + w3VP

(2)

where DP, TP and VP are the distance priority, traffic priority and velocity priority,
respectively, and w1, w2 and w3 are weight factors. The rationale behind this equation is
that an MH has the highest priority as it gets closer to the target cell(DP) at a high
mobility speed(VP) and require the service with high TP like multimedia services.
QoS upgrading calls that have been blocked as a result of BCAC are inserted into
UpQ. When the amount of bandwidth available in a cell is greater than Thup , the
bandwidth is allocated to the calls in UpQ in the FIFO order.
DTT, PQueue and UPQueue Algorithm
In ACAC, different CAC algorithms are adopted according to the type of each call;
new, handoff and QoS upgrading calls are tested using DTT, PQueue and UPQueue
algorithm, respectively. In case of a new call, it requests a call admission to BS periodically until DTT expires, where DTT is set when the MH is powered on. If available
bandwidth of BS is not enough to satisfy the new call’s request after DTT, it is
dropped.
In case of handoff calls, call classification and bandwidth borrowing algorithms are
invoked. Call classification algorithm as below is applied to MHs that have just entered the overlapped area. It classifies handoff calls into two classes: high and low.
Class High contains handoff calls that have relatively higher priority than the others.
Once being classified into this class, the calls will not be degraded into class low and
bandwidth assignment to them will be also guaranteed. On the other hand, class low
contains handoff calls that have relatively lower priority than the others. They have
high chances of being dropped during ACAC and bandwidth assignment to them will
not be guaranteed.

TPQ

In the pseudo code above, B j(Total Bandwidth of PQ) is the sum of bandwidth
requested by all the MHs that reside in cell j’s PQ. Bandwidth satisfaction point(BSPj)
points out the right most MH in PQ of which bandwidth request can not be satisfied
avail
from cell j’s available bandwidth. To be specific, if B j is equal to or higher than
TPQ
avail
B j, the priorities of all the MHs residing in PQ become high. However, if B j is
TPQ
lower than B j, only the priorities of MHs that are at the left-hand side of BSPj become high and the others become low. The MHs that are at the right-hand side of BSPj
and have a high priority maintain its current priority. MHs residing in PQ are sorted
based on their priorities.
When the priority of MHi becomes high during its stay in the overlapped area, the
required bandwidth is assigned to it if the amount of bandwidth available in the target
cell is sufficient enough, or bandwidth borrowing algorithm[1],[3],[4] is triggered to
assign the amount of bandwidth requested by MHi. On the other hand, the algorithm is
not triggered immediately if the priority of MHi belongs to class low, and the triggering of the algorithm is delayed until its priority is upgraded to class high. A handoff
call of MHi is dropped, if the priority of MHi cannot be upgraded to class high until it
leaves the overlapped area.
In case of QoS upgrading call, an MH is stored into the QoS upgrading queue in
order to upgrade the QoS level. This happens either when the MH wants to upgrade its
service quality or to reclaim as much bandwidth as it has lent to the other MH. Only
when the amount of bandwidth available in BS is above the threshold, the required
bandwidth is assigned. Just because there is sufficient bandwidth in a cell, the QoS
will not be upgraded immediately by UPQueue algorithm. To be specific, if the available bandwidth is below the threshold, MHi is stored in the QoS upgrading queue.
Next, only when the available bandwidth is above the specific threshold, the QoS of
MHi is upgraded in the FIFO order. Note that the available bandwidth below the
threshold is assigned to new calls and handoff calls, because the QoS upgrade calls
have the lower priority than both new calls and handoff calls.

3 Performance Evaluation
In this section, we compare the performance of proposed scheme with that of other
schemes such as CSP, GCP, and AGCP. In CSP [5], new and handoff calls are not
distinguished from each other and are admitted as long as available bandwidth of a
cell can provide the required bandwidth to the MH. In other words, the same priority
is given to both the new and handoff calls. This scheme has the low CBP, but high
CDP.
GCP [5],[6],[7] reserves a fixed amount of bandwidth for multimedia handoff calls.
This scheme reserves as much bandwidth as required by an MH requesting multimedia
services and having high probability of entering a certain cell. The bandwidth is assigned later when the MH actually enters the cell. This scheme has an advantage of
having the low CDP for multimedia handoff calls by assigning reserved bandwidth to
them. However, since the available bandwidth is reserved for multimedia calls, new

506

and non-multimedia handoff calls have high CBP and CDP. Moreover, the reserved
bandwidth may turn out not to be used, thus resulting in low bandwidth utilization.
AGCP [2],[8],[9] is a policy that adaptively reserves a portion of bandwidth for
multimedia handoff calls depending on network condition. If the CDP of a cell is
above the specific threshold (e.g., 0.05), the amount of reserved bandwidth is increased. On the other hand, if the CBP is below a certain threshold, a certain amount
of reserved bandwidth is decreased only when the utilization of reserved bandwidth is
below specific threshold (e.g. 0.5). This scheme has the lower CDP than GCP. When
the number of new calls increases dramatically, however, the CDP is increased as
well.

In this simulation, we suppose that the mobile multimedia network is comprised of
100 hexagonal cells, each of which diameter is 1 km. We also suppose that each cell
provides the bandwidth of 30Mbps and communicates with its six neighboring cells.
The client moves at a speed from 1 to 100 Km/h. New call reqeusts are generated
according to a Poisson distribution with the arrival rate λ(calls/second) in each cell. A
new call is assumed to be requested at any place in the cell with an equal probability.
Table 2 shows six typical traffic classes used in the simulation[8].
Performance metrics considered in the simulation are CBP, CDP and bandwidth
utilization. The metrics are measured with respect to CSP, GCP, and AGCP as the
arrival rate of new calls vary.
We first attempt to find out the most reasonable rate of class I calls by performing
our simulation under the situation as follows; the arrival rate of new calls is fixed at
0.1(MH/sec) and the proportion of class I calls is incremented by 10% from 10% to
90%. We find that the CBP, CDP, and bandwidth utilization showed the best performance when the proportion of class I call is 50%. We then perform our simulation under
the following situation; the proportion of class I calls is fixed at 50% and the arrival
rate of new calls is incremented by 0.01(MH/sec) from 0.01 to 0.1.
Fig. 4 shows the CBP for each of four schemes as the arrival rate of new calls increases from 0.01 to 0.1. According to the figure, 2LCAC has the lowest CBP followed by CSP. It also shows that AGCP has the highest CBP. This is because 2LCAC
allows an MH to request the acceptance of its blocked new call repeatedly at the

A Design and Performance Evaluation of 2-Level Call Admission Control Scheme

507

BCAC stage until DTT expires without human-user’s intervention. The CBP of AGCP
and GCP are lower than that of CSP. The reason for that is that AGCP and GCP assign higher priority to handoff calls than new calls and reserve some bandwidth for
handoff calls. As a result, as the amount of bandwidth assigned to new calls decreases,
the CBPs of AGCP and GCP are higher than those of 2LCAC and CSP. On the other
hand, the CSP treats new and handoff calls equally and does not reserve bandwidth for
handoff calls.

Fig. 5. Dropping Probability of Handoff Calls

Fig. 5 shows the CDP of each scheme as the arrival rate of new calls increases from
0.01 to 0.1. 2LCAC has the lowest CDP, followed by AGCP, GCP, and CSP. This is
because 2LCAC gives a priority to both class I and class II handoff calls efficiently
and fairly. Fair bandwidth assignment is guaranteed by 2LCAC based on the type of
calls, the speed of MH, and MH’s distance from the target cell. Even when there is not

508

M.I. Kim and S.J. Kim

enough bandwidth available in a cell, handoff call admission is guaranteed for handoff
calls with high priority by reclaiming bandwidth at the ACAC stage. If there are many
new call requests, the CSP has the highest CDP because it does not assign higher
priority to handoff calls than new calls. In case of AGCP and GCP, both have the high
CDP because the reserved bandwidth might not be used at all and be eventually
wasted.

Fig. 6. Bandwidth Utilization

Fig. 6 shows the bandwidth utilization of each scheme. 2LCAC has the highest
utilization followed by CSP, GCP, and AGCP. This is because 2LCAC uses available
bandwidth of a cell more efficiently than other schemes. When there is available
bandwidth in a cell, it is assigned to QoS upgrade calls. Since QoS upgrade calls of an
MH reclaim bandwidth which has been previously lent to handoff calls with high
priority, 2LCAC manage to utilize the bandwidth efficiently. On the other hand, AGCP
and GCP have low bandwidth utilization, because reserved bandwidth can be unused
and be wasted.

4 Conclusion
For efficient and fair CAC, we proposed 2LCAC scheme using priority queue. We
classified MH calls into three types: new, handoff, and QoS upgrade call. The priority
of each type is assigned in the order of handoff, new, and QoS upgrade call, and each
type uses the different call admission policy. 2LCAC consists of two stages: BCAC
and ACAC. At the former stage, calls from an MH are admitted without distinguishing
new and handoff calls just as the CSP, when the amount of bandwidth available in a
cell satisfies the required bandwidth of the MH. In case of QoS upgrading calls, they
are accepted if the available bandwidth is above the specific threshold; otherwise, the
calls are blocked and ACAC is triggered. The latter stage tests whether the calls

509

blocked at the former stage can be accepted or not using DTT, PQueue, and UPQueue
algorithms depending on the type of calls.
In order to evaluate the performance of our scheme, we measured the metrics such
as CBP, CDP, and bandwidth utilization. We then compared the performance of
2LCAC with that of three different schemes: CSP, GCP, and AGCP. Because CSP
does not distinguish new calls from handoff calls, it has the low CBP and high CDP.
Since GCP reserves a fixed amount of bandwidth, it has the low CDP, but the highest
CBP. This scheme has the lowest bandwidth utilization because it cannot adaptively
readjust the amount of bandwidth for handoff calls. The performance of AGCP is
better than that of other schemes, but still worse than that of 2LCAC. To be specific,
2LCAC lowers its CBP and CDP by 6~11% and 5~8%, respectively, compared to
CSP, GCP and AGCP. The bandwidth utilization of 2LCAC is also better than that of
other schemes by 7~8%. All in all, 2LCAC utilizes the bandwidth of BS more efficiently than other conventional schemes.
