Abstract. In this paper, the possibility of application of the variational
iteration method for solving the inverse Stefan problem with a Neumann
boundary condition is presented. This problem consists in a calculation
of temperature distribution as well as in the reconstruction of the function which describes the heat ﬂux on the boundary, when the position of
the moving interface is known. The validity of the approach is veriﬁed
by comparing the results obtained with the analytical solution.
Keywords: Inverse Stefan problem, Variational iteration method, Heat

Introduction

In this paper, the author is trying to solve the one-phase inverse design Stefan problem with a Neumann boundary condition. This problem consists in
a calculation of temperature distribution as well as in the reconstruction of
the function which describes the heat ﬂux on the boundary, when the position
of the moving interface is known. This paper applies the variational iteration
method to the discussed problems. The variational iteration method was developed by Ji-Huan He [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and is useful for solving a wide range of
problems [1, 2, 3, 7, 5, 8, 9, 4, 6, 10, 11]. The application of the variational iteration method for direct and inverse Stefan problems with a Dirichlet boundary
condition is considered in paper [12].
It is possible to ﬁnd an exact analytical solution of the inverse Stefan problem
only in few simple cases. In other cases we are left with approximate solutions
only [15, 17, 18, 16, 14, 13]. For example in papers [14, 13], authors used the Adomian decomposition method combined with optimization for an approximate
solution of a one-phase inverse Stefan problem. However, in paper [17], the authors compare selected numerical methods to solve a one-dimensional, one-phase
inverse Stefan problem.

Problem Formulation

Let D = {(x, t); t ∈ [0, t∗ ), x ∈ [0, ξ(t)]} be a domain in R2 (Figure 1). On the
boundary of this domain, three components are distributed:
Γ0 = {(x, 0); x ∈ [0, v = ξ(0)]} ,
Γ1 = {(0, t); t ∈ [0, t∗ )} ,

(2.1)
(2.2)

Γg = {(x, t); t ∈ [0, t∗ ), x = ξ(t)} ,

(2.3)

where the initial and boundary conditions are given.
In domain D, we consider the heat conduction equations:

the function describing the position of the moving interface Γg , and u, t and x
refer to temperature, time and spatial location, respectively.
The discussed inverse Stefan problem consists in ﬁnding a function to describe
the temperature distribution u(x, t) in domain D, and function q(t) describing
the heat ﬂux on the boundary Γ1 , which will satisfy equations (2.4)–(2.8). All
other functions (ϕ(x), ξ(t)) and parameters (α, k, κ, u∗ ), are known.

Solution of the Problem

Using the variational iteration method we are able to solve the nonlinear equation:
L(u(z)) + N (u(z)) = f (z),
(3.1)
where L is the linear operator, N is the nonlinear operator, f is a known function
and u is a sought function. At ﬁrst, we construct a correction functional:
z

λ L(un−1 (s)) + N (˜
un−1 (s)) − f (s) ds,

un (z) = un−1 (z) +

(3.2)

0

where u
˜n−1 is a restricted variation [1, 2, 3, 4], λ is a general Lagrange multiplier [19, 1, 2], which can be identiﬁed optimally by the variational theory [20,
1, 2, 3], and u0 (z) is an initial approximation. Next, we determine the general
Lagrange multiplier and identify it as a function of λ = λ(s). Finally, we obtain
the iteration formula:
z

λ(s) L(un−1 (s)) + N (un−1 (s)) − f (s) ds.

un (z) = un−1 (z) +

(3.3)

0

The correction functional for equation (2.4) can be expressed as follows:
x

un (x, t) = un−1 (x, t) +

λ

˜n−1 (s, t)
∂ 2 un−1 (s, t)

(3.4)

From equation (3.4), the general Lagrange multiplier can be identiﬁed as follows:
λ(s) = s − x.

(3.5)

Hence, we obtain the following iteration formula:
x

(s − x)

un (x, t) = un−1 (x, t) +
0

∂ 2 un−1 (s, t)
1 ∂un−1 (s, t)

−
∂s2

(3.6)

Next, we select an initial approximation in the form:
u0 (x, t) = A + B x,

(3.7)

where A and B are parameters. For the determination of parameters A and B, we
will use the Neumann boundary condition (2.6) and the condition of temperature

continuity (2.7). To this end, we require that the initial approximation u0 (x, t)
fulﬁls the above conditions. The boundary condition (2.6) requires:
1
B = − q(t),
k

(3.8)

whilst the condition (2.7) leads to the result:
A = u∗ +

1
ξ(t) q(t).
k

(3.9)

Hence, the initial approximation has the form:
u0 (x, t) = u∗ +

1
q(t) ξ(t) − x .
k

(3.10)

Finally, we obtain the following iteration formula:
1
q(t) ξ(t) − x ,

un (x, t) = un−1 (x, t) +
u0 (x, t) = u∗ +

(3.12)

Because function un (3.6) depends on an unknown function q(t), we have
derived this function in the form of a linear combination:
m

q(t) =

pi ψi (t),

(3.13)

i=1

where pi ∈ R and the basis functions ψi (t) are a linear independence. The
coeﬃcients pi are selected to show a minimal deviation of function un (3.6) from
the initial condition (2.5) and the Stefan condition (2.8). Thus, we are looking
for the minimum of the following functional:

(3.14)

After substituting equations (3.12) and (3.13) to functional J, diﬀerentiating
it with respect to the coeﬃcients pi (i = 1, . . . , m) and equating the obtained
derivatives to zero:
∂J
p1 , . . . , pm = 0,
∂pi

i = 1, . . . , m,

(3.15)

a system of linear algebraic equations is obtained. In the course of solving this
system, coeﬃcients pi are determined, and thereby, the approximated distributions of the heat ﬂux q(t) on boundary Γ1 and temperature un (x, t) in domain D
are obtained.

Example

The theoretical considerations introduced in the previous sections will be illustrated with an example, where the approximate solution will be compared with
an exact solution. We consider an example of the inverse Stefan problem, in
which: α = 0.1, k = 1, κ = 10, u∗ = 1, t∗ = 1/2 and
ϕ(x) = e−x ,

ξ(t) =

Next, an exact solution of the inverse Stefan problem will be found by means of
the following functions:
u(x, t) = et/10−x ,
q(t) = e

(x, t) ∈ D,

t ∈ [0, t ].

(4.3)

As basis functions we take:
ψi (t) = ti−1 ,

i = 1, . . . , m.

(4.4)

In Figures 2 and 3, we present an exact and reconstructed distribution of the
heat ﬂux on the boundary Γ1 for n = 1, m = 5 and for n = 2, m = 2. The left
ﬁgure presents the exact (solid line) and the determined approximate position
(dash line), whereas the right ﬁgure shows diagrams of the distribution of errors
which occur when reconstructing the heat ﬂux.

Figure 4 presents error distributions in the reconstruction of the phase change
temperature (left ﬁgure) and error distributions in the reconstruction of the
Stefan condition along the moving interface (right ﬁgure) for n = 1 and m = 5.
The calculations were made for an accurate moving interface position and for
a position disturbed with a pseudorandom error with a size of 1%, 2% and 5%.

As shown in the results, the presented algorithm is stable in terms of the input

Conclusion

In this paper, solution of one-phase inverse Stefan problems is presented. The
problem consists in a calculation of temperature distribution and of a function
which describes the heat ﬂux on the boundary, when the position of the moving
interface is known. The proposed solution is based on the variational iteration
method. The calculations show that this method is eﬀective for solving the problems under consideration.
The advantage of the proposed method comparing it with classical methods
consists in obtaining the heat ﬂux and temperature distribution in the form of
continuous functions, instead of a discreet form. The method applied does not
require discretization of the region, like in the case of classical methods based on
the ﬁnite-diﬀerence method or the ﬁnite-element method. The proposed method
produces a wholly satisfactory result already in a small number of iterations,

whereas the classical methods require a suitably dense lattice in order to achieve
similar accuracy, which considerably extends the time of calculations.
