Abstract. The model of the part of the rat somatosensory cortex was
examined. Large network of Hodgkin-Huxley neurons was simulated and
the modular architecture of this structure divided into layers and subregions was implemented. High degree of complexity required eﬀective
parallelisation of the simulation. In this article the results of the parallel
neural computations are presented. An occurrence of the self-organised
criticality was observed and its characteristics as a function of the connections number was investigated. It was proved that frequency of the socalled spike potential avalanches depends on the density of inter-neuron
connections. In addition some benchmarking runs were conducted and
parallelisation eﬀectiveness is presented to some extent.

Introduction

The critical point is a point at which a system changes radically its behaviour
or structure. Self-organised critical phenomena are deﬁned by a complex system
which reaches a critical state by its intrinsic dynamics, independently of a value of
any control parameter. A typical example of a system exhibiting a self-organised
criticality (SOC) is a sand pile model. The sand is slowly dropped onto a surface,
forming a pile. As the pile grows, avalanches occur and they carry the sand from
the top to the bottom of the pile. At least in the model, the slope of the pile
becomes independent of the rate at which the system is driven by dropping sand.
This exempliﬁes so-called (self-organised) critical slope [1].
The oldest numerical models describing the sand-pile problem are presented
i.e., in [1], [3], [6]. In this model, a one-dimensional pile of sand is considered.
Grains of sand are stored in the columns. The dynamics of the system is deﬁned
by a set of equations describing the eﬀect of a one-grain addition. After a proper
number of grains have been added to the appropriate columns, a critical inclination of the sand pile occurs and this causes disorder leading to relaxation of
the whole system. This disorder is referred to as an avalanche.
Critical states of a system are signalled by a power-law distribution in some observable. In the case of sand-piles, the size and the distribution of the avalanches

can be measured. A frequency of an avalanche occurrence in the system is a
function of its size and can be expressed by the power law [1]:
D(S) ∼ S −k ,

(1)

where k is always a characteristic number for a given system.
Complex systems exhibiting behaviour predicted by the SOC have been widely
investigated [4], [5], [8], [10], [11], [14]. Earthquakes, forest ﬁres, biological evolution are just three examples of wide range of phenomena that have been successfully modelled this way [1]. There are experiments that conﬁrm the existence
of frequency tuning and adaptation to stimulus statistics in neurons of the rat
somatosensory cortex [7]. SOC was found in the model of large biological neural
networks [13], however, the aim of the research discussed in this contribution
was to investigate whether and how the SOC occurrence depends on the number of connections in the simulated brain tissues. Good understanding the SOC
mechanism in the model will allow us to design new series of experiments with
the large number of interacting neurons leading to the discovery of new class of
neurodynamical phenomena taking place in real brains.
Simulations of microcircuits consisting of numerically complicated HodgkinHuxley (HH) neurons [9] are power consuming. The simulation time can be shortened by using cluster-based parallelised computing. All the simulations discussed
in this paper were conducted in the parallel version of GENESIS compiled for
the MPI environment [15]. The choice of the GENESIS simulator allowed us to
use many processors and to design eﬀective way of parallelisation.
Remarkably, in this article we demonstrate that critical relaxation phenomena depend on the density of inter-neuron connections existing in the network.
Consequently, the eﬀectiveness of model’s parallelisation, the simulation time
and its speedup as a functions of the connections’ number will be presented in
the last section.

Model and Method of Parallelisation

The somatosensory pathways bring sensory information from the periphery into
the brain, e.g., from a rat’s whisker to the somatosensory cortex. Information
from the snout passes along the trigeminal nerve, projecting to the trigeminal
complex in the brainstem, which sends projections to the medial ventral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (VPm). Each whisker has a representative physical
structure in the brain, forming 2-D maps of the whisker pad throughout the
pathway. In the cortex, these structures are known as barrels. They are formed
from clusters of stellate cortical neurons, with the cell bodies arranged in a
ring and dendrites ﬁlling the middle ”hole”. The dendrites form synapses with
multiple axons rising from the VPm [16].
The neurons chosen for the simulations were implemented according to the
HH model [9]. Cells are relatively simple (for detail, see Appendix A). The
only one modiﬁcation in the model of neuron was arranged in order to avoid
rapid synchronisation of the whole network: an additional parameter responsible

622

for the probability of exocitosis was added for each synaptic connection in the
post-synaptic neuron. Such a change required a simple modiﬁcation of original
GENESIS code. Changed version of GENESIS, compiled for Linux and MPI,
can be downloaded from [15].
The simulated net consisted of 2025 of the above-mentioned neurons. All the
cells were placed on a square-shaped grid with 45 rows and 45 columns. Each
neuron was identiﬁed by a pair of numbers ranging from 0 to 44. Network cells
were divided into 22 groups, called layers, numbered from 1 to 22. Communication between the neurons based on the following principles - the input signal
from each cell from the m-th layer was transported to all the neurons from
layers: m + 1, m + 2, m + 3, ..., m + Ns , where Ns was the integer number, not
greater than the number of layers (see Fig. 1). Note that such a structure (2-D
with dense ”neural rings”) imitates the structure of the rat’s cortical barrels.
The system can be easily parallelised, so we decided to simulate the problem on
15 processors. The network was divided into 15 zones. In each zone the same
number of neurons was simulated. The zones were numbered from 1 to 15 and
the way in which the zones were arranged is presented in Fig. 1. Such a choice
allowed us to run simulations in optimal way, without the barriers being timed

out. The complexity of the system increases rapidly with Ns , so does the time
of simulation. A good parallelisation of the model not only shortens its simulation time, but most often makes it executable at all. That is why parallelisation
techniques are so important for HH systems with large number of synapses.
Synaptic connections were characterised by three parameters: weight w, time
delay τ , and the probability p of transporting the signal, which corresponded
to the mentioned probability for the occurrence of exocitosis. The probability
p was set to a constant, the same for all of the synapses (p = 0.5).Values of
two other parameters depend on the position of both the pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neuron. For each pair of neurons from the m-th layer and the n-th layer
respectively, the parameters w and τ were chosen according to following rules:
w=

w0
,
|m − n|

τ = 10−4 |m − n| [s],

(2)
(3)

where w0 was a positive constant (in our simulations w0 = 2). The system was
stimulated by the neuron N [23, 23] that was the main receptor of activities from
the outside of the net (i.e., a glass capillary stimulating the whisker [7] or an
electrode transmitting some random stimulus directly into the cortex). As a
result, the receptor was producing a periodic spike potential with a frequency of
about 80 Hz. The net was characterised by the parameter T that corresponded
to the biological system’s real working time (in these simulations T = 15 s).

Simulations and Results

The stimulus was transported from the central unit to all other cells through
the arranged connections. During the simulation, the time of spike potential
occurrence was collected for each neuron. The avalanche occurs when the group
of neurons is spiking in the same and small interval of time (i.e., ti = 1 ms). The
algorithm used to compute the number of avalanches was implemented in C++
(the simple analysis of text ﬁles containing the time and value of membrane
potential, in search for the neurons having high spiking activity in the same
time interval).
It was shown that for a system with a small number of neighbourhoods
(Ns < 6) (the same small number of connections), the power law cannot precisely describe the number of spike-potential avalanche occurrences as a function
of their size (Fig. 2). When the Ns = 6 a kind of phase transition leading the
system to the SOC behaviour can be observed (Fig. 3) [13]. Systematic analysis
of the SOC was performed i.e., by Peter Sloot [12] and the aim of our research
described in this contribution was to investigate whether the occurrence of SOC
depends only on the number of neighbourhoods or it can appear or disappear
for a given Ns as a function of the intra-network connections’ number. As for
the most sensitive parameter the value of 6 was chosen for the Ns parameter in
all series of the aforementioned experiments [13].

Then the another parameter px deﬁning the probability of synapse creation
between two neurons from the the simulated network was implemented in the
model. Surprisingly it was noted that self-organisation depends not only on the
number of connections (what could be concluded from previous research) but
also on the network architecture. On the basis of Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 one could
hypothesise that when the number of connections falls the self-organisation disappears. However, for Ns = 6 the SOC manifests itself even better when we
decrease the strength of the inter-neuron communication by setting the px below 0.07 (Fig. 4). What’s more when 0.07 < px < 0.4 the SOC behaviour tends to
disappear (see two curves in Fig. 5) to come back for px > 0.4 (Fig. 6). Because
of relatively high system complexity and tendency to the rapid synchronisation
the number of spikes decreases with the number of connections in the network
(Fig. 7). That is why the number of avalanches and the inclination of the SOC

Parallelisation Eﬀectiveness

The local cluster used for all the simulations was built of 13 machines including
one special machine – the so-called “access node”. Each SMP machine had two
64-bit 1.4 GHz Itanium2 IA64 processors with 4 GB of RAM memory. The cluster works under control of Debian Linux Sarge (v. 3.1) and 2.6.8-1 kernel version.
The model is simulated in GEneral NEural Simulation System GENESIS v.2.2.1
with its MPI extension. A gcc compiler was used for the system compilation
and in case of the MPI and Linux OS the compilation required some tuning of
GENESIS code. Changed version can be found in [15].

Fig. 10. Time of simulation and speedup as a function of px

The length of a typical run for Ns = 6 and T = 15 s was about 10 hours when
the problem was parallelised for 15 nodes. However, for one node the simulation
time ranged from 12 h to 230 h depending on the value of px . This gave us
in the best case the speedup of 23 (Fig. 10). At ﬁrst sight it is very optimistic
result especially for the structures with large number of synapses. One should
remember that 5 years ago such networks with Ns > 6 modelled on one SPARC
400 MHz node had the simulation time of about 3 weeks.

Conclusions

Systematic analysis of the simulated part of the rat’s somatosensory cortex dynamics was conducted. Eﬀective parallelisation was applied. SOC manifests itself
in large biological neural networks. The ”quality” of SOC depends both on the
number of connections and on the architecture of the system. The role of SOC

phenomena in mammalian brains is still unrecognised. However, good modelling
will make it possible for us to design the new series of neuroscientiﬁc experiments,
leading in the end to better understanding of the brain functionality.

Appendix A: Properties of HH Neurons
Our model consisted of multicompartmental neurons with two dendrite compartments, a soma and an axon. The dendrites contained a synaptically activated
channel and the soma had voltage activated HH sodium and potassium channels.
The behaviour of each compartment was equivalent to the behaviour of some
electrical circuit [2]. Thus, each circuit was characterised by a typical for GENESIS group of parameters set as follows: resistances Ra = 0.3 Ω, Rm = 0.33 Ω,
capacity Cm = 0.01 F, and potential Em = 0.07 V. For the soma compartment
Ek = 0.0594 V and for the dendrite Ek = 0.07 V. Conductance for each type of
ionic channels was chosen to be: GK = 360 Ω −1 and GN a = 1200 Ω −1 . These
parameters originated from neurophysiological experiments [2] and were chosen
to make the model biologically more realistic. The soma had a circular shape
with the diameter of 30 μm, dendrites and axon were cable-like with the length
of 100 μm. All the other parameters were chosen as suggested by GENESIS authors to simulate the behaviour of the biological-like neurons [2]. More details
concerning the HH model can be found elsewhere [2], [9].
