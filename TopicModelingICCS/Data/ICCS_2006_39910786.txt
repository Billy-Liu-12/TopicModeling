Abstract. This paper presents the inﬂuence of choice of the mutation
operator on the accuracy of a solution of a two-phase design inverse
Stefan problem using genetic algorithms. In the problem to be solved,
the coeﬃcient of convective heat transfer on one boundary had to be so
selected that the moving interface of the phase change (freezing front)
would take the given position.

Introduction

In this paper we are going to ﬁnd a solution of a two-phase design inverse Stefan
problem [1], for which the coeﬃcient of convective heat transfer on one boundary
should be so selected that the moving interface could take the given position. The
solution will consist in minimization of the functional whose value is the norm of
the diﬀerence between the given interface position and the position reconstructed
for the selected convective heat-transfer coeﬃcient. For the minimization of the
functional genetic algorithms were used, whereas the Stefan problem was solved
by an alternating phase truncation method [4]. The paper presents the inﬂuence
of choice of the mutation operator on the accuracy of the results obtained.

Formulation of the Problem

On the boundary of domain D = [0, b] × [0, t∗ ] ⊂ R2 three components are distributed Γ0 = {(x, 0); x ∈ [0, b]}, Γ1 = {(0, t); t ∈ [0, t∗ ]}, Γ2 = {(b, t); t ∈ [0, t∗ ]},
where initial and boundary conditions are given. Let D1 (D2 ) be this subset of
domain D which is occupied by liquid (solid) phase, separated by the freezing
front Γg = ξ(t).
We will look for an approximate solution of the following problem. For given
position of freezing front Γg , the distribution of temperature Tk in domain Dk
(k = 1, 2) is calculated as well as function α(t) on boundary Γ2 , which satisfy
the following equations (for k = 1, 2):

where ak are the thermal diﬀusivity in liquid phase (k = 1) and solid phase
(k = 2), λk are the thermal conductivity, α is the coeﬃcient of convective heattransfer, T∞ is the ambient temperature, L is the latent heat of fusion, k are
the mass density, and t and x refer to time and spatial location, respectively.
We will look for the α(t) function in the form:

where αi ∈ [αli , αui ]. For the given function α(t) ∈ Vαp the problem (1)–(6)
becomes a direct Stefan problem, whose solution enables ﬁnding the position of
the interface ξ(t) corresponding to the α(t) function. Using the found interface
position ξ(t) and the given position ξ ∗ (t) we can build a functional which will
specify the error of an approximated solution:

Genetic Algorithm

For the representation of the vector of decision variables (α1 , α2 , α3 ), a chromosome was used in the form of a vector of three real numbers (real number
representation) [2, 3]. The tournament selection and elitist model were applied
in the algorithm. As the crossover operator, arithmetic crossover was applied.
The results of calculations were then compared for diﬀerent mutation operators: uniform mutation (M1 ), Gaussian mutation (M2 ) and two operators of
nonuniform mutation (M3 and M4 ) for diﬀerent functions describing the uniformity of distribution. In the case of uniform mutation (M1 ) the αi gene is
transformed according to the equation:
αi = αli + r αui − αli ,

where r is a random number with a uniform distribution from the domain [0, 1],
and αui and αli are the upper and lower limits, respectively, of variability interval

of the αi parameter, i.e. αi ∈ αli , αui . In the case of Gaussian mutation (M2 )
the αi gene is transformed according to the equation:
αi = αi + r(τ ),

(10)

where r(τ ) is a random number with normal distribution with mean value equal
to zero and variance equal to:
σ 2 (τ ) =

N − τ αui − αli
,
N

(11)

where τ is the current generation number, N is the maximum number of generations. In the calculations, a nonuniform mutation operator was used as well.
During mutation, the αi gene is transformed according to the equation:
αi =

αi + Δ(τ, αui − αi ),
αi − Δ(τ, αi − αli ),

(12)

and a decision is taken at random which from the above formulas should be
applied. Function Δ(τ, x) was assumed in the form (M3 and M4, respectively):
τ

Δ3 (τ, x) = x 1 − r(1− N )d

or Δ4 (τ, x) = x r 1 −

(13)

where r is a random number with a uniform distribution from the domain [0, 1],
τ is the current generation number, N is the maximum number of generations
and d is a constant parameter (in the calculations, d = 2 was assumed).

Calculations

It was assumed in the calculations that: b = 0.08, ak = λk /(ck k ) for k = 1, 2,
λ1 = 33, λ2 = 30, c1 = 800, c2 = 690, 1 = 7000, 2 = 7500, L = 270000. The
temperature of solidiﬁcation is T ∗ = 1500, ambient temperature is T∞ = 50 and
initial temperature is equal ϕ0 (x) = 1540. The exact value of the convective heat
transfer coeﬃcient amounts to:
⎧
⎪
⎨1200 dla t ≤ 38,
α(t) = 800
(14)
dla t ∈ (38, 93],
⎪
⎩
250
dla t > 93.
For each of the mutation operators and diﬀerent probability values of crossover (pc ) and mutation (pm ), calculations were carried out for ten diﬀerent initial
settings of a pseudorandom numbers’ generator.
In the case of Gaussian mutation (M2 ), the best results were obtained for
the crossover probability pc = 0.75 and for mutation probability pm = 0.01; the
average value of the minimum found was 0.00245326, and the average value of
the minimum point found αavg = (1203.179, 792.496, 250.506).

For the remaining mutation operators, a zero value of the minimized functional
was obtained. In the case of a uniform mutation (M1 ) and a nonuniform mutation with Δ3 (τ, x) function (M3 ), the zero value was obtained twice, for pc ∈
{0.7, 0.75} and pm = 0.1. In the case of a nonuniform mutation with Δ4 (τ, x)
function (M4 ), this value was obtained three times, for pc ∈ {0.7, 0.75, 0.8}
and pm = 0.1. The results with the same value of the objective function can
be subjected to further evaluation due to errors in the convective heat-transfer
coeﬃcient reconstruction. The least errors were obtained for a nonuniform mutation with Δ3 (τ, x) function (M3 ) and pm = 0.1 and pc = 0.7. The values found
for the reconstructed coeﬃcient are αavg = (1200.003, 800.008, 249.999). A not
much worse result was obtained for the same operator and crossover probability
equal 0.75. In that case, the values founds were αavg = (1200.01, 800.006, 249.99).
In the remaining cases, the convective heat-transfer coeﬃcient values were reconstructed with greater errors. Thus, in the case of the nonuniform mutation with Δ4 (τ, x) function (M4 ), the following values were found: αavg =
(1199.934, 800.072, 249.996) for pc = 0.8, αavg = (1200.037, 799.991, 249.998) for
pc = 0.75, αavg = (1200.190, 799.863, 250.003) for pc = 0.7. For the uniform mutation (M1 ), the values determined were as follows: αavg = (1200.197, 799.861,
250.001) for pc = 0.75, αavg = (1200.344, 799.720, 250.012) for pc = 0.7.
Calculations for other values of the genetic algorithm parameters were also
made, however, for none of the sets of values better results were obtained than
those presented in this paper.

Conclusion

The paper presents the inﬂuence of choice of the mutation operator on the accuracy of a solution to the two-phase design inverse Stefan problem using genetic
algorithms. The problem under consideration consisted in such selection of a convective heat transfer coeﬃcient on one boundary that the moving interface would
take the given position. Results for a uniform mutation, nonuniform mutation
and Gaussian mutation have been presented. The best results were obtained for
the nonuniform mutation with Δ3 (τ, x) function and mutation probability (pm )
equal 0.1 and crossover probability (pc ) equal 0.7. The calculation results obtained show a very good approximation of the exact solution, thus corroborating
the usefulness of the presented approach.
