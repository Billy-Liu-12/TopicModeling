Abstract
Social networks, as well as many other real-world networks, exhibit overlapping community structure. In this
paper, we present formulas which facilitate the computation for characterizing the overlapping community structure
of networks. A hypergraph representation of networks with overlapping community structure is introduced. Using
the hypergraph representation we setup a social network model which exhibits innate tunable overlapping community
structure. By comparing simulation results of our model with results of the Hyves network and the SourceForge
network, we show that our model captures most of the common features of large social networks. We analytically
give the relation between the maximum membership number of a network and the adjacency eigenvalues of the simple
graph representation of the network, which is the line graph of the hypergraph representation.
Keywords: social networks, overlapping community structure, preferential attachment, hypergraph

1. Introduction
Social networks, as one type of real-world complex networks, are currently widely studied [1, 2, 3]. Most social
networks possess common properties of the real-world networks, such as high clustering coeﬃcient, short characteristic path length and power law degree distribution [4, 5]. Particularly, they possess some special properties like
assortative mixture, community and hierarchical structure [3, 6, 7, 8]. The communities are the subnets, which exhibit
relatively higher levels of internal connections. Community structures feature important topological properties that
have catalyzed researches on community detection algorithms and on modularity analysis [9, 10, 11]. The communities overlap with each other when nodes belong to multiple communities. The overlap of diﬀerent communities exists
widely in real-world complex networks, particularly in social and biological networks [12, 13, 14]. Human beings
have multiple roles in the society, and these roles make people members of multiple communities at the same time,
such as companies, universities, families or relationships, hobby clubs, etc. Proteins may also involve in multiple
functional categories in biological networks, which explains why and how overlapping communities emerge in social
and biological networks. In the movie actor network, where nodes are the actors and two actors are connected if they
have been casted together in one or more movie, we could regard the set of actors in one movie as a community,

and this community is a fully connected subnetwork which are called cliques or complete subgraphs in the language
of graph theory. According to the deﬁnition of movie actor network, the communities of all the movies are cliques.
These communities overlap with each other if they have actors in common. The similar networks are the science
coauthorship networks (nodes represent the scientists and two nodes are connected if they have coauthored one or
more articles and the articles are communities), the journal editor networks (nodes as the editors and two editors are
adjacent if they serve on the same editorial boards of journals) and sports player networks (nodes as players and two
players who played in the same games are connected). These social networks naturally contain many cliques.
Palla et al. [12] deﬁned four metrics to describe how the communities of networks overlap with each other: the
membership number of an individual, the overlapping depth of two communities, the community degree and the community size. Palla et al. [12] showed that the communities of real-world networks overlap with each other signiﬁcantly.
They reported that the membership number of an individual and the overlapping depth of two communities and the
community size all follow a power law distribution, except that the community degree features a peculiar distribution
that consists of two distinct parts: an exponential distribution in the beginning and a power law tail. Pollner et al. [15]
proposed a toy model of which both the community size and the community degree follow a power law distribution,
by applying preferential attachment to community growth. There have been many eﬀorts devoted to the modeling
of social networks [16, 17, 18]. The growing networking model proposed by Toivonen et al. [18] succeeds in reproducing the common characteristics of social networks: community structure, high clustering coeﬃcient and positive
assortativity. The degree distribution of this model is somewhat deviating from a power law distribution despite being
heavy-tailed.
We propose a complete set of metrics which can fully characterize the overlapping community structure of networks. We represent social networks by hypergraphs. The hypergraph representation of networks facilitates of the
computations of the characterizing metrics. We establish a hypergraph-based social network model which exhibits
innate tunable overlapping community structure. By comparing simulation results of our model with results of realworld networks, we show that our hypergraph model exhibits the common properties of large social networks: the
community size, the community degree and the community overlapping depth all follow a power law distribution,
and our model possesses high clustering coeﬃcient, positive assortativity, short average path length. By tuning the
input individual membership number to follow a power law distribution, the individual degree and the interest-sharing
number also follow a power law distribution. We prove that all eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the line graph of
the hypergraph, which represents a network, are not smaller −mmax , where mmax is the maximum membership number
of that network.
2. Deﬁnition of metrics for characterizing the overlapping community structure
In social networks, each individual can be characterized by the degree and the number of communities to which the
individual belongs. A pair of individuals can be characterized by the number of common communities, which indicates
how many common interests they share. Similarly, the size of a community, which is the number of individuals it
contains, and the degree of a community, which is the number of other communities with whom individual(s) are
shared, give additional information of a community. The number of individuals that two communities share can
suggest how much they overlap with each other. All the six metrics for characterizing the overlapping community
structure are deﬁned formally as follows:
Deﬁnition 1. (a) The degree d j of an individual j in a network is deﬁned by the number of individuals that connect
to j; (b) The membership number m j of an individual j is deﬁned by the number of communities of which j is a
member. The membership number m j , together with the degree d j , reﬂect the social connection of individual j; (c)
The interest-sharing number αi, j of individual i and j is the number of communities to which they both belong; (d) The
community size s j of community j equals the number of nodes that belong to community j; (e) The community degree
u j of community j is the number of other communities sharing individual(s) with community j; (f) The overlapping
depth βi, j of two communities i and j equals the number of individuals that they share.
Palla et al. [12] have deﬁned the individual membership number m j , the community size s j , the community
degree u j and the community overlapping depth βi, j . This paper augments the set of metrics to characterize the
overlapping community structure with predeﬁned individual degree d j and the interest-sharing number αi, j . The

probability distributions of d j , m j , αi, j , s j , u j and βi, j play an important role in characterizing the community structure
of a network.
We use the graphs in Figure 1 to exemplify the deﬁnitions of those metrics. The graph in Figure 1 (a) has labeled
ﬁve nodes which are members of at least two communities. Using the metrics introduced in Deﬁnition 1, the graph
illustrated in Figure 1 (a) has the following speciﬁcations: d1 = 24, d2 = 12, d3 = d4 = 8 and d5 = 9. Nodes 1 − 5
belong to 5, 3, 2, 2 and 2 communities respectively, thus m1 = 5, m2 = 3 and m3 = m4 = m5 = 2. Individual 1 and
2 belong to only one common community, hence α1,2 = 1. As shown in Figure 1 (b), the communities I − IV have
6, 5, 5 and 6 nodes respectively, hence, sI = sIV = 6 and sII = sIII = 5. By the deﬁnitions, we have the overlapping
width βI,II = 2, βI,III = 1, βI,IV = 3, βII,III = 2, βII,IV = 0 and βIII,IV = 1, and the community degree uI = uIII = 3,
uII = uIV = 2.
3. The hypergraph representation of social networks
A hypergraph is the generalization of a simple graph, which is an unweighted, undirected graph containing no
self-loops nor multiple links between the same pair of nodes. A hypergraph H (N, L) has N number of nodes and L
number of hyperlinks. Its nodes are of the same type as those of a simple graph, as shown in Figure 2 (a). However its
hyperlinks can connect multiple nodes, like hyperlink A in Figure 2 (a) connecting nodes I, II, · · · , V. The hyperlinks
of a hypergraph should not be confused with hyperlinks on a webpage. A hypergraph is linear if each pair of hyperlinks
intersects in at most one node. Hypergraphs where all hyperlinks connect the same number m of nodes are deﬁned as
m-uniform hypergraphs with the special case that 2-uniform hypergraphs are simple graphs.

are the disks with diﬀerent colors marked with Roman numerals. A node and a hyperlink are incident if the node is surrounded by the hyperlink.
The hyperlinks and nodes represent the individuals and the communities respectively. Individuals participate in multiple communities, implying
that the communites overlap with each other. (b) The line graph of the hypergraph in (a), which is a simple graph. The nodes here denote the
individuals while the communities consist of links of the same color and the nodes which are incident to them. Note that this graph is also the line
graph of the hypergraph.

Deﬁnition 2. The line graph of a hypergraph H (N, L) is deﬁned as the graph l (H), of which the node set is the set of
the hyperlinks of the hypergraph and two nodes are connected by a link of weight t, when the corresponding hyperlinks
share t node(s).
3.1. An illustrative example
In this subsection, we introduce the representation of social networks by hypergraphs. Traditionally, unweighted
and undirected networks are represented by simple graphs. We show that social networks with fully connected communities can also be represented by hypergraphs with nodes denoting the fully connected communities and the hyperlinks denoting the individuals. We give an exemplary social network and then represent it by a hypergraph. Table
1 describes a small social network based on the friend-colleagueship of members of the NAS research group (Network Architectures and Services Group at Delft University of Technology). Individuals A, B, C, D, E, F are members
of NAS and the other individuals are the members of communities which overlap with the NAS community. Two
individuals have friend-colleagueship if they are in the same community, hence all the communities in this exemplary
social network are fully connected.
We represent this network by the hypergraph shown in Figure 2 (a). The nodes of the hypergraph denote the
communities and the individuals are denoted by the hyperlinks. There are 12 communities as described in Table 1,
corresponding to the 12 nodes of the hypergraph in Figure 2 (a), and there are 53 individuals among whom 6 NAS
members with the membership number mA = 5, mC = mD = 3, mB = mE = mF = 2. If an individual belongs to
multiple communities, the corresponding nodes are connected by the hyperlink specifying that individual.
Figure 2 (b) depicts the line graph of the hypergraph in Figure 2 (a), which represents the exemplary social
network. In the line graph, the individuals are denoted by nodes and the communities are denoted by links of the same
color and the nodes which are incident to those links. In spite of its small size, the communities and the overlap of
communities are shown clearly. By deﬁnition, the line graph in Figure 2 (b) of the hypergraph in Figure 2 (a) is a
simple graph.
3.2. Expressions of metrics for overlapping communities
The line graph l (H) is a simple graph when H (N, L) is linear, and the line graph l (H) of a nonlinear hypergraph
H (N, L) is a weighted graph. The adjacency matrix Al(H)
L×L of the line graph l (H) of a hypergraph H (N, L) can be
computed from the unsigned incidence matrices RN×L of hypergraphs

where the entry ri j of R is 1 if node i and hyperlink j are incident, otherwise ri j = 0. Basically, the adjacency matrix
Al(H) equals the matrix RT R setting all the diagonal entries to zero. The interest-sharing number αi, j of individual i

4. Model Description
As a common property, the individual degree of social networks follows a power law distribution [1][4]. Palla
et al. [12] and Pollner et al. [15] reported that the community size also follows a power law distribution. Nacher
et al. [19] and Manka-Krason et al. [20] showed that the nodal degree of line graphs of simple graphs with power
law degree distribution follows a power law distribution. We ﬁnd that the line graph of a hypergraph with power law
degree distribution also has a power law degree distribution. As stated before, the degree of a node in a hypergraph
is actually the size of the corresponding community. Therefore, our idea to construct a network with both power law
individual (node degree) distribution and power law community size distribution is to generate the line graph of a
hypergraph with power law degree distribution. To generate a hypergraph with power law degree distribution, we
introduce preferential attachment to grow our hypergraphs.
To avoid confusion, we call the nodes of our hypergraphs directly the communities. We add step by step new
communities and new hyperlinks to the starting small size hypergraph, namely a seed, which has no impact on our
hypergraph model. Our hypergraph model is described by the following procedure:
1. Start with a seed hypergraph H0 (N0 , L0 ) with N0 communities and L0 hyperlinks.
2. Suppose that the desired number of individuals (hyperlinks) of the network to be generated is L + L0 . Determine
the membership numbers for the L new hyperlinks: M = m1 m2 · · · mL . Note that the membership
number vector M is the input parameter of our hypergraph model.
3. At growing step j, j = 1, 2, · · · , L, add a new hyperlink j and a new community to the hypergraph. Make the
new hyperlink j and the new community incident, and the membership number of j becomes 1.
(a) Connect the new hyperlink j to the existing community i with probability pi = si / si , where si is the
community size of i and si is the sum of community sizes of all the existing communities.
(b) Repeat 3a) m j − 1 times so that the membership number of the hyperlink j increases to m j .
4. Repeat 3) until the number of hyperlinks increases to L + L0 .
Compute the metrics d j , m j , αi, j , s j ,u j and βi, j using the methods given in Section 3.2 including the formulas (1)
to (5). The membership number m j of j at growing step j is a free parameter that we can tune.

5. Simulation Results
5.1. Our hypergraph model
We use a linear hypergraph H (15, 10) with the membership number m j = 3, j = 1, 2, · · · 10, as the starting seed. In
our hypergraph model, we add 3000 new hyperlinks (individuals) and 3000 new nodes (communities) to the starting
hypergraph by 3000 growing steps. Hence, all the hypergraphs we generate have 3015 nodes and 3010 hyperlinks.
During the 3000 growing steps, we apply the constant membership number m j = 3, j = 1, 2, · · · , 3000, and
obtain the hypergraph H3 . Similarly, we generate H5 and H10 . Since Palla et al. [12] have reported a power law
membership number distribution in real-world networks, we apply power law distributed membership numbers and
obtain the hypergraph H pow . We generate a scale-free simple graph with 3000 nodes of which the degree D of a
random node obeys Pr [D = d] = 2.67d−2.31 , and take the nodal degree sequence as the membership numbers in the
growing steps for the generation of H pow . The maximum membership number of H pow is 126. We also generate
the hypergraph HU[2,121] with a uniformly distributed membership number in the interval [2, 121], whose maximum
membership number is close to that of H pow .
We denote the community size and community degree of a random community by S and U, the community
overlapping depth of a random pair of communities by B, the individual degree of a random individual by D, and the
interest-sharing number of a random pair of hyperlinks by Φ.
Due to the preferential attachment, we expect the community sizes of H3 , H5 , H10 , HU[2,121] and H pow to follow
power law distributions, which are conﬁrmed by Figure 3a and 4a. In Figure 3b and 4a the probability density functions (pdfs) of the community degrees of H3 , H5 , H10 , HU[2,121] and H pow are all well ﬁtted by power law functions with
exponents shown in Table 2. The community overlapping depths of all hypergraphs follow power law distributions
with exponents which are relatively larger in absolute values. The community overlapping depths of all hypergraphs
are generally much smaller than the community size. The pdfs of the individual interest-sharing numbers of H3 , H5 ,
H10 and HU[2,121] can not be ﬁtted by power law functions, while α of H pow is well ﬁtted by a power law function, as

shown in Figure 3e and 4b. The pdfs of individual degrees of H3 , H5 and H pow are ﬁtted by power law functions with
negative exponents while those of H10 and HU[2,121] have positive exponents.
5.2. Real-world networks
5.2.1. The Hyves social network
The popular online social networking site in the Netherlands, Hyves, has more than 10 million users. Nearly half
of the Hyves users make their proﬁles open to the public. From the open proﬁles we can see information of users
including companies, schools, colleges, clubs and other organizations, to which they belong. According to the data
we have collected, there are 17, 619 users claiming that they belong to one or multiple schools. The total number of
these claimed schools are about 10, 326. We construct a network with users as nodes and two users are connected by
a link when they belong to the same school, which implies that the members of a community are fully connected to
each other in this extracted Hyves network.
In Figure 5a and 5b, we observe that the individual membership number m and community overlapping depth β
and individual interest-sharing number α of the Hyves network generally smaller than the other three metrics, and all
follow power law distributions with exponents of −4.83, −5.54 and −4.60 respectively. The pdfs of the community
size s and the community degree u are well ﬁtted by power functions with exponents of −1.87 and −2.43 respectively,
while the pdfs of the individual degree d can only be ﬁtted by a power law function with exponents of −1.29 in the
middle region. Note that the exponents of m, α and β are more negative than those of s, u and d. The Hyves network
has a rather high clustering coeﬃcient C = 0.84, a high assortativity ρD = 0.29 and an short average path length
l = 6.73.
5.2.2. The SourceForge software developers’ network
SourceForge is a web-based project repository assisting developers to develop and distribute open source projects.
SourceForge facilitates developers by providing a centralized storage and tools to manage the projects. Each project
has multiple developers. We create a network in the same way that the Hyves network is constructed: take developers
as nodes and connect two nodes if they belong to the same project: This implies that all the communities are cliques.
Compared to the network obtained from Hyves, the network obtained from SourceForge has a much larger size of
161, 653 nodes and 78, 676 links.
As shown in Figure 5c, the pdfs of all the six metrics d j , m j , αi, j , s j ,u j and βi, j of are well ﬁtted by power law
functions with exponents shown in Table 2. The SourceForge network also has a high clustering coeﬃcient, a high
assortativity coeﬃcient and an small average path length, which are shown in Table 2.

5.2.3. Results of Palla et al. [12]
They deﬁned k-clique-community as a union of all k-clique that can be reached from each other through a series
of adjacent k-clique with adjacency means sharing k − 1 nodes. Based on the concept of a k-clique-community, they
studied the overlapping community structure of three large networks: the coauthorship network of the Los Alamos
cond-mat archive (k = 6), the word association network of the South Florida Free Association norms (k = 4) and
the protein interaction network of the yeast S. Cerevisiae from the DIP database (k = 4). They reported that the
community size s of these three networks follow a power law distribution. The community overlapping depths and
the membership numbers are in general small, and follow power law distributions with more negative exponents.
5.3. Discussion
The membership number m of the Hyves network, the SourceForge network, the coauthorship network, the word
association network and the protein interaction network all follow a power law distribution and this is the motivation
why we tune the membership number distribution of our hypergraph model to a power law distribution. Imposing
a power law distribution to m in our hypergraph model makes the community degree, community size and the individual degree of our hypergraph model all follow a power law distribution as shown in Figure 4a. Consequently, the
community overlapping depth β and the individual interest-sharing number α of our hypergraph model also follow
power laws, as depicted and ﬁtted in Figure 4b. We observe in Figure 4a and 4b that in general β and α are much
smaller than m, s, u and d, and this is consistent with the observations of the mentioned ﬁve real-world networks in
Figure 5a, 5b, 5c and ﬁgures of [12]. The tail of pdf of individual degree d of H pow decreases more rapidly which is
consistent with observations in Figure 5a and 5c.
Tuning the membership number m of our hypergraph model to constant numbers or a uniform distribution, does
not inﬂuence the pdf of the group size s, due to the preferential attachment, as conﬁrmed by Figure 3a. The pdfs of
community degree u and community overlapping depth β still follow a power law distribution in H3 , H5 , H10 and
HU[2,121] . We conjecture that this phenomenon is caused by the power law distribution of the community size. In
Figure 3d, we ﬁt the middle region of the pdf of the individual degree d by a power function, although a large part of
the pdf of d does not seem to be power-law-like. Interestingly, the exponent becomes positive in H10 and HU[2,121] .
The individual interest-sharing number α follows a non-power-law distribution shown in Figure 3e. Since α ≤ m by
deﬁnition, we only see a few points in the pdf of α for constant m = 3, 5, 10.
Table 2 reports the exponents of the power law distribution of these six metrics and also the clustering coeﬃcient
C, assortativity ρD and average shortest path length l. Our hypergraph model possesses high clustering coeﬃcient,
positive assortativity, short average path length, and these properties are independent of the input membership numbers
m. Note that the exponents of the power law distributions of s, α and β of Hyves network and H pow are quite close.

6. Conclusion
Many real-world networks, especially social networks, exhibit an overlapping community structure. We present
formulas which facilitate the computation for characterizing the overlapping community structure of networks. We
have established a hypergraph-based social network model which exhibits innate tunable overlapping community
structure. Our hypergraph representation of networks features the following properties: (i) facilitation of the computations of the characterizing metrics d j , m j , αi, j , s j ,u j and βi, j ; (ii) facilitation in proving Theorem 3; (iii) ease in
manipulating/tuning the overlapping community structure. By comparing simulation results of our model with results
of the Hyves network, the SourceForge Network and results of Palla et al. [12], we have shown that our hypergraph
model exhibits the common properties of large social networks: the community size s, the community degree u and
the community overlapping depth β all follow a power law distribution, and our model possesses high clustering
coeﬃcient, positive assortativity, short average path length. By tuning the input individual membership number to
follow a power law distribution, the individual degree d and the interest-sharing number α also follow a power law
distribution.

AppendixA. Spectral property of networks described by hypergraph model
Theorem 3. Denoting by λ an arbitrary eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the line graph of the hypergraph
representing a network, we have
λ ≥ −mmax
(A.1)
where mmax is the maximum membership number of that network.
Proof 4. (a) Networks described by m-uniform hypergraph.
With constant membership number m, these networks are represented by m-uniform hypergraphs Hm (N, L), whose
unsigned incidence matrix R has exactly m one-entries and N − m zero-entries in each column. Thus, all the diagonal
entries of RT R are m. The adjacency matrix of the line graph of Hm (N, L) can be written as,
Al(Hm ) = RT R − mI

(A.2)

where RT R is a Gram matrix [21][22]. For all matrices An×m and Bm×n with n ≥ m, it holds that λ (AB) = λ (BA) and
λ (AB) has n − m extra zero eigenvalues
λn−m det (BA − λI) = det (AB − λI)
which yields,
det Al(Hm ) − (λ − m) I = λL−N det RRT

The adjacency matrix Al(Hm ) has at least L − N eigenvalues −m. Since xT RT R x = (Rx)T Rx = Rx

(b) Networks described non-uniform hypergraph.
We represent these networks by non-uniform hypergraphs H (N, L) with maximum membership number mmax . The
matrix R of H (N, L) has at most mmax one-entries in each column. Therefore, the largest diagonal entry of RT R is
mmax . The adjacency matrix of the line graph of non-uniform hypergraph H (N, L) is,
