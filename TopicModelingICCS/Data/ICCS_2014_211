Abstract
Detailed DFT computations and classical trajectory dynamics simulations have been carried
out to establish the origin of the extra stability of alloxan. The effect of solvent, basis set and DFT
methods have been examined. Two non-covalent intermolecular dimers of alloxan, namely the Hbonded and the dipolar dimers have been investigated to establish their relative stability. Quantum
theory of atom-in-molecule and NBO analysis has been performed.
Key words: Alloxan, DFT, classical trajectory dynamic simulation, QTAIM , Extra stability, NBO analysis

1 Introduction
Alloxan, the oldest known pyrimidine, has many biological and medicinal applications . The
structure of alloxan is long considered as a problem". Thus, alloxan is antiaromatic and strong
electrophile [1,2]. Alloxan contains four C=O proton acceptor groups and two N-H proton donor
groups, yet its x-ray structure does not show any hydrogen bonds [3]. Nevertheless, alloxan is
characterized by high melting point and remarkable stability as compared to other pyrimidines.
Furthermore, the strong acidity of alloxan ( pKa=6.63) can not be explained on the basis of the tetra
keto structure suggested by previous experimental [4-6] and theoretical studies [7-11].
The present work aims to explore the origin of the extra stability of alloxan. Non-covalent
intermolecular interactions involving alloxan, will be investigated to establish their relative stability.
Classical trajectory dynamics simulations are then conducted to explore regions around and in the
immediate vicinity on the PES to establish their global minimum structures. The quantum theory of
atom-in-a-molecule and NBO analysis will be performed to identify and characterize the forces that
govern the structures of the studied clusters.

2 Computational methods
All calculations have been carried out using the Gaussian 09 [12] package of programs. The
geometries of alloxan and its tautomers, have been fully optimized at the DFT/B3LYP/6-311++G**
level of theory [13-15]. Frequency calculations were performed at the same level of the theory in
order to characterize the stationary points and to evaluate the zero -point energy (ZPE). The stable
alloxan conformer was subjected to further confirmation and validation using other functionals,
namely ωB97X-D [16] and M06-2X [17,18] methods, using the same basis set. All clusters studied
were also fully optimized at the ωB97X-D and M06-2X levels of theory using the triple zeta 6311++C** basis set. Basis set superposition error (BSSE) have been estimated using the counterpoise
(CP) method of Boys and Bernardi [19] . Solvent effects have been considered using two solvent
continuum models, namely the SCRF and PCM models
Quantum chemical topology analysis were carried out at the quantum theory of atoms in
molecules[20] (QTAIM) level of theory through the program AIMAll [21-24]. Hyper conjugative [25]
interactions have been computed and analyzed using the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) theory.
Throughout this work molecular orbitals and electrostatic potential maps were constructed using
Gauss View 5.0.8 visualization program [26].
Classical trajectory dynamic simulations [27,28] have been performed using the Atom Centered
Density Matrix Propagation(ADMP) molecular dynamics model [29-31].

3 Results and discussion
3.1 Intermolecular non-covalent interaction in alloxan
There are two competing non-covalent interactions in alloxan. These are, a H-bond interaction and
intermolecular dipolar interaction involving the C=O group s. The long rang correlated
D method will be used, in the present work, in conjunction with the triple Zeta polarized basis set 6311++G**. This theoretical model will be validated against other models namely the M06-2X.

3.2 Intermolecular H-Bonding in Alloxan
Table 1 presents the intermolecular H-bond energy and length as computed for the alloxan
H-bonded dimer.
The H-bond length is typical for a strong H-bond. The ZB97X-D method is
capable of picking up more dispersion energy than the M06-2X method. Careful inspection of the
potential energy profile for the H-bonded alloxan dimer, as computed by the two DFT methods,
predict a sharp increase in potential energy at short distances. On the other hand, the change in
potential energy is smooth at longer distances and reaches a dissociation limit at about 2.750Ǻ.

Computations have also been carried out at the B3LYP/6-311++G** level of theory and using
Grimme's D3 dispersion term for correcting for the dispersion interaction. The calculated stabilization
energy, corrected for the BSSE, is given in table 1. It is clear that the B3LYP, shows much improved
results after D3 correction, however, results are still of lower quality as compared to the other long
rang correlated methods used.
DFT-MD simulation was carried out at the ZB97X-D/6-31+G** level of theory. The trajectory
dynamics show that the fully optimized structure is a global minimum on the PES. Slight geometry
changes cause a marked decrease in its stability. All changes within the time domain explored fall
within a very narrow energy range. The geometry deformations accompanying the dynamic
simulations can be summarized in the following. First, the behavior of the two H-bonds, C=O24---H7 and the C=O12-----H2O , is not cooperative at first. The behavior then changed to a cooperative
one after 20 fs, where the two H-bonds increase simultaneously to reach maximum values of 1.973
and 2.055 Ǻ, respectively. This is accompanied by deformation of the non H-bonded, N-H bonds outof-plan the alloxan ring. This is accompanied by a considerable energy barrier that forces the two
alloxan rings to get closer to each other again. Figure 1 summaries the evolution of energy and Hbond length in the time domain studied. Also included in figure 1 the global minimum structure of the
H-bonded alloxan dimer where atomic forces magnitude and directions are indicated. Careful
inspection of figure 1 indicates clearly that there is a considerable energy barrier of 150 kJ/mol
opposing the increase in the H-bond length. This is reached within the first 10 fs of the dynamic
simulation. There is a considerable force component directed along the O--H H-bond. This force
components tends to keep the two alloxan rings at the equilibrium distance and opposes the stretching
(or compression) of the H-bonds.

Figure 1. Evolution in the potential energy and H-bond length in the trajectory time domain and (D) Geometric
structure of the H-bonded alloxan dimer results from the 80 fs trajectory dynamics. Arrows and numbers on
atoms indicate direction and magnitude of forces.

Table 2 presents a Comparison between, NBO characteristics and second order perturbation
interaction energies, of alloxan and that of the H-bonded dimer.
Thus, the natural charges on the oxygen and nitrogen atoms increase indicating that the
polarization in the N-H---O region increases markedly. The electron configuration of the oxygen
atom BO shows increased p-character with the consequent increase in the directional character. In
alloxan, the major donor acceptor interactions involve the nitrogen and oxygen lone pair orbitals (LP).
The π-conjugative interaction of the nitrogen nπ interacts with the C-O BO's is enhanced in the Hbonded dimer. Oxygen lone pair orbital nπ enjoys considerable hyp ercojugative interaction with the
acceptor σ* orbitals of the C-N and the C-C BO's. This hyperconjugation is also enhanced upon
intermolecular H-bond formation. Data in table 2 reveals clearly the origin and extent of the H-bonded
interaction in the alloxan dimer. The two oxygen lone pairs, in-plan n (1) and perpendicular n (2),
contribute to this H-bond interaction. Both nO orbitals act as donor orbitals in their interaction with
the N-H antibonding NBO. The magnitude of this CT interaction is 7-8 kcal/mol. Therefore, in
addition to the polarization in the N-H---O bond region and the apparent electrostatic origin of the Hbonding, there is also further stabilization of the H-bonded dimer due to charge transfer interaction.

Origin of the Extra Stability of Alloxan

S. Aziz, R. Hilal, B. Allehyani and S. Elroby

The intermolecular dipolar dimer, in the gas phase, show marked stabilization energy of 44.79
kJ/mol as shown in table 3. This is comparable to the stabilization energy of the H-bonded dimer. This
stabilization energy is sensitive to the environment. Thus, in polar solvents, as water, the stabilization
energy is reduced to almost half its value in the gas phase. This can be explained on the basis that, in
polar solvents, there exist another dipolar interaction, n amely the alloxan-water dipolar solvent
continuum interaction. This interaction competes with the alloxan -alloxan interaction and hence
causes reduction in the stabilization energy. The presence of solvent also causes elongation of all
intermolecular bond lengths without any significant change in the cluster geometry. Non -polar
solvents also have the effect of reducing the stability of the dipolar dimer but to a much less extent.

Origin of the Extra Stability of Alloxan

The electrostatic potential map computed for the dipolar alloxan dimer, ca. figure 2, reveals that
electrostatic potential extents over the entire cluster with the dipolar potential of the carbonyl group of
one alloxan moiety directed towards the other alloxan ring. Note that the electrostatic potential of the
carbonyl group of the second alloxan ring is free and directed away from the cluster. This would
suggest the possibility of extending the cluster and accounts for the observed crystal structure of
alloxan.
DFT-MD simulation was carried out at the ZB97X-D/6-31+G** level of theory. The run was
submitted for 800 points at 300K aiming to explore a conformational time domain of 80 fs. of 0.1 fs
each. The dimer attempt to reorient to a H-bonded structure where H7 is approaching C=O23. This is
accompanied by a deformation of the alloxan ring where the N-H bond is forced out-of plan. This
change from the dipolar to a H-bonded dimer is opposed by a potential energy barrier o f 94.668
kJ/mol. Figure 2 displays the evolution of the potential energy, the formation of the H-bonded
structure and the corresponding change the out-of-plan N-H bond angle, for the dipolar alloxan dimer
within the time domain studied. NBO analysis, ca. table 2, indicates that the dipolar interaction
causes increase in the polarization and the directional character of the C-O bond orbitals. The natural
charges on oxygen and nitrogen increase almost to the same extent as that in case of the H-bonded
dimer. The electron configuration of the oxygen atom shows increase of the pπ contribution. NBO
analysis also reveals that the dipolar interaction between the two alloxan rings is dominated by
electrostatic forces. Charge transfer interactions are minimal and considerably smaller than in the case
of the H-bonded dimer.

3.4 Quantum Chemical Topology
3.4.1. Alloxan
Figure 3 presents the molecular graph computed for the tetra keto tautomer of alloxan[33-35].
Bonding characteristics are summarized in table 4. All four C=O bonds show the lowest values for
their BCP’s as compared to other bonds in the molecule. This would indicate their high ionic character
as compared to the bonds in alloxan. For the four C=O bonds, C1-O12 has the largest BCP, in fact it
has a value of 2U(r) more than twice that for the other three C=O bonds. On the other hand, the
2U(r) at RCP is positive indicating electron density depletion from this region into the nuclear and
bonding regions.
This map reveals that, while the charge transfer in C-O bond region exceed that in any other region
in the molecule, both the C and O atoms have significant residual valence density; density that is
particularly evident in the large non-bonded charge distribution on C. It imparts to C a large ‘back
polarized’ atomic dipole that results in a near vanishing molecular dipole moment. Thus, the charge
distributions of neither C nor O approach their ‘ionic’ limit.

(c) The dipolar dimer computed at the QTAIM level using the 6-311++G** wave function.

3.4.2. The H-bonded dimer
The molecular graph of the dimer is displayed in figure 2 together with the atomic dipole moment
component vectors and the values of BCP’s and RCPs. The molecular graph, in figure 2, indicates the
formation of a third ring the H-bonded 8- membered ring which shows small positive RCP value
indicating the depletion of the electron density from the ring to the bonding regions. The oxygen atom
dipole moment components are oriented along the O - C main component and also along the O----H
hydrogen bond path with a marked BCP of 0.11. The formation of a H- bond causes a decrease of the
electron density in the C=O bond region. Thus, this bond, in alloxan, shows a BCP of 0.2995 and is
depleted to a value of 0.2766 in the dimer(ca. table 4). This has the consequence increase in the
electron density in the (O)C-N bond regions. Furthermore, a concentration of the electron charge
density is also observed in the N6-H7 and N14-H20 bond regions. These charge migrations are
responsible for the stabilization of the dimer.
Furthermore, the two N-H----O hydrogen bonds show the lowest ellipticity values of 0.03(ca.
table 4). This would suggest there symmetric in-plan character with a minimal contribution from the

1372

C=O π- system. The two H-bonds are characterized by 2U(r)㸼0 and L㸺0 which , indicate the
formation of H-bonds of medium strength[36]. It is interesting notice that the value of L for
C16=O22 and C4=O10 groups; are negative indicating that the ionic nature of these two C=O bonds
is much higher than the other C=O bonds.
In the relief map of figure 2 the charge concentration is apparent at the nuclear regions with a
pronounced nonbonding electron density around the heteroatoms. Note the saddle point around the
oxygen atom.

3.4.3. The dipolar dimer
The molecular graph in figure 2 and the corresponding data in table 4 indicate the complex nature
of the dipolar interaction. Thus, the interaction is dominated by the carbonyl groups, namely C1=O12
from one alloxan moiety and two C=O groups from the oth er alloxan moiety. Note the formation, in

1373

two different plans, of two characteristic new rings for this dipolar interaction. The formation of new
bond paths that identify these rings is somewhat misleading. This is because the dipolar interaction
involves polarization and accumulation of the electron density in the region between the two alloxan
moieties which cannot be represented within the QTAIM except by bond paths between the closest
pair of atoms .

3.5 Conclusion
The origin of the extra stability of alloxan as compared to other pyrimidines has been explored.
The quantum chemical topology analysis of alloxan indicated the high ionic character of the carbonyl
groups and marked charge density depletion from the ring into these bonding regions. Thus, although
the two non-covalent
interactions in alloxan, namely H-bond and intermolecular dipolar
interactions are of comparable stabilities, yet the later seems more favorable due to its ability to form
aggregates involving the C=O groups. This may very be well underlie the stability of alloxan.
