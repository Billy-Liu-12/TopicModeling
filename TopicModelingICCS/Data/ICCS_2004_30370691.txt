Abstract. In this study, we present information granulation (IG)-based optimization approach to the design of fuzzy controller. The design procedure dwells
on the use of evolutionary computing (genetic algorithms) and the estimation of
the polynomial model that is carried out by effectively combining Hard CMeans Clustering (HCM) Method with Least Mean Square (LSM) method. The
developed approach is applied to a nonlinear system such as an inverted pendulum where we show the results of comprehensive numerical studies and carry
out a detailed comparative analysis

1 Introduction
Recently, the ongoing challenge we are facing when design advanced system control
has resulted in a diversity of underlying methodologies, development platforms and
detailed algorithms. As one of the representative design approaches, a design approach of fuzzy controller by means of IG-based estimation technique is introduced
in this study. The intent of this study is to develop, optimize and experiment with the
fuzzy controllers when developing a general design scheme of Computational Intelligence. One of the difficulties in the construction of the fuzzy controller is to derive a
set of optimal control parameters of the controller such as linguistic control rules,
scaling factors, and membership functions of the fuzzy controller[7,8]. Genetic algorithms (GAs) can be used to find the optimal control parameters. However, evolutionary computing is computationally intensive and this may be a point of concern when
dealing with amount of time available to such search. For instance, when controlling
a nonlinear plant such as an inverted pendulum of which initial states vary in each
case, the search time required by GAs could be prohibitively high when dealing with
dynamic systems. As a consequence, the parameters of the fuzzy controller cannot be
easily adapted to the changing initial states of this system such as an angular position

and an angular velocity of the pendulum. To alleviate this shortcoming, we introduce
a nonlinear mapping such as HCM-LMS tandem based polynomial. The development
process consists of two main phases. First, using genetic optimization we determine
optimal parameters of the fuzzy controller for various initial states (conditions). Second, we build up a nonlinear model that captures a relationship between the initial
states of the system and the corresponding genetically optimized control parameters.

2 Design Methodology of Fuzzy Controller
The block diagram of fuzzy PID controller is shown in Figure 1[5,6].
2.1 Auto-tuning of the Fuzzy Controller by Gas
Genetic algorithms (GAs) are the search algorithms inspired by nature in the sense
that we exploit a fundamental concept of a survival of the fittest as being encountered
in selection mechanisms among species[1]. The overall design procedure of the fuzzy
PID controller realized by means of GAs consists of the following steps
[Step 1.] Select the general structure of the fuzzy controller according to the purpose
of control and dynamics of the process.
[Step 2.] We set the initial individuals of GAs for the scaling factor of fuzzy controller.
[Step 3.] Here, all the control parameters such as the scaling factors GE, GD, GH and
GC are tuned at the same time.

3 Experimental Studies
In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy PID controller by applying it to the inverted pendulum system. The control goal is to balance the pole
starting from nonzero conditions by supplying appropriate force to the cart[4].
First, we select several initial angular positions and angular velocity and obtain the
auto-tuned control parameters by means of GAs according to the change of each
selected initial angular positions and angular velocity, then build a table. Secondly,
we use HCM-LMS tandem-based polynomial to estimate the control parameters in
the case that the initial angular positions and angular velocity of the inverted pendulum are selected arbitrarily within the given range. Table 1 shows the estimated scaling factors of the fuzzy PID controller and describes performance index of the fuzzy
PID controller with the estimated scaling factors. Figure 1 demonstrates pole angle
for (a) Case 1 and (b) Case 2 respectively

From the above Figures 2, we observe that the fuzzy PD and fuzzy PID controllers
control effectively the inverted pendulum system. The proposed estimation algorithm
such as HCM-LMS tandem-based polynomial generates the preferred model architecture.

4 Conclusion
In this paper, we have proposed a two-phase optimization scheme of the fuzzy PID
and PD controllers. The parameters under optimization concern scaling factors of the
input and output variables of the controller that are known to exhibit an immense
impact on its quality. The first phase of the design of the controller uses genetic computing that aims at the global optimization of its scaling factors where they are optimized with regard to a finite collection of initial conditions of the system under control. In the second phase, we construct a nonlinear mapping between the initial conditions of the system and the corresponding values of the scaling factors. From the
simulation studies, using genetic optimization by scaling factor estimation modes and
the estimation algorithm of the HCM-LMS tandem based polynomial model, we
showed that the fuzzy PD/PID controller controls effectively the inverted pendulum
system in a nonlinear range of θ.
