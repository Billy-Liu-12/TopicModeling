Abstract. Novel approach to the analytical design of asteroidally shaped two-dimensional FIR ﬁlters with arbitrary orientation of the frequency response in the frequency plane is presented. The design consists
of two steps. In the ﬁrst step, the asteroidal 2-D FIR ﬁlter in the basic position along the frequency coordinates is designed. The design is
based on the analytical contour approximation using the parametric representation of the contour. Closed form formulas for the approximation
of the contour with asteroidal shape were derived. In the second step,
the asteroidally shaped FIR ﬁlter is rotated by the desired angle in the
frequency plane. Closed form formulas for the calculation of the impulse
response of the ﬁlter are presented. One example demonstrates both steps
of the design procedure.

Introduction

Two-dimensional FIR ﬁlters with asteroidal contour of the frequency response
represent advantageous choice in the processing of rectangular objects in the
image area. This is based on the fact, that spectra of rectangular objects exhibit
asteroidal shape. Because of the arbitrary orientation of the objects in the image
area, ﬁlters with general orientation of the frequency response are desired. The
image ﬁltering can be accomplished by both the nonlinear [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]
and linear [1], [2], [10] ﬁlters. In the design of 2-D FIR ﬁlters the McClellan
transformation technique [1] became popular. Methods for the design of 2-D FIR
ﬁlters with circular, elliptical, fan and diamond contour based on the McClellan
transformation are available, see e.g. [2]-[4]. Here we present novel analytical
method for the design of the coeﬃcients of the McClellan transformation for 2D FIR ﬁlters with asteroidal contour. Using the proposed method other shapes
of the contour of the 2-D FIR ﬁlter are achievable, too. These are for example

ellipses, circles, epicycloids, hypocycloids and roses. The consecutive rotation
allows to orient the frequency response of the ﬁlter in the frequency plane as
speciﬁed.

Transformation Method

The McClellan transformation design technique [1] transforms the 1-D frequency
response
H(ejω ) =

a(n)cos(nω) =

response

where Tn (x) are Chebyshev polynomials of the ﬁrst kind. In the transformation

cos(ω) = F (e

)=

f (p, q)cos(pω1 )cos(qω2 )

(3)

p=0 q=0

the coeﬃcients f (p, q) are called coeﬃcients of the McClellan transformation
and the integers P, Q represent the order of the McClellan transformation. For
constant transformation function
cos(ω0 ) = F (ejω1 , ejω2 ) = const

(4)

the relation between the frequencies ω1 and ω2
ω2 = g(ω1 )

(5)

deﬁnes the contour of the transformation function. The transformation function
F (ejω1 , ejω2 ) aﬀects the shape of the 2-D frequency response H(ejω1 , ejω2 ), whereas the 1-D frequency response H(ejω ) determines the selectivity of the 2-D
ﬁlter. The central part in the design of 2-D FIR ﬁlter using McClellan transformation represents the determination of the coeﬃcients f (p, q).

Contour Approximation

The contour approximation consists in the design of the coeﬃcients f (p, q) of
the McClellan transformation. The contour approximation is solved by the minimization of the error
E(ω1 , ω2 ) = cos(ω0 ) − F (ejω1 , ejω2 )

(6)

66

with respect to the desired shape of the contour (5). The minimization of (6) is
accomplished using least square method

D

∂E 2 (ω1 , g(ω1 ))
dω1
∂f (p, q)

(7)

where D is the region of deﬁnition of the desired contour (5). The minimization
(7) is usually solved numerically. Instead of the explicit relation (5), we propose
the parametric representation of the contour ω1 = g1 (ϕ) , ω2 = g2 (ϕ) or more
speciﬁcally
(8)
ω1 = g1 (cosϕ, sinϕ) , ω2 = g2 (cosϕ, sinϕ) .
Due to the parametric representation of the contour (8), the numerical solution
of (7) can be replaced by the analytical solution of the error
kπ
0

∂E 2 (g1 (ϕ), g2 (ϕ))
dϕ .
∂f (p, q)

(9)

For the second-order McClellan transformation (P = Q = 2), we have to determine nine coeﬃcients f (p, q). Deﬁning the error function in the form
E(ω1 , ω2 ) = A0 + A1 f (1, 0) + A2 f (0, 1)

(10)

+ A3 f (1, 1) + A4 f (2, 0) + A5 f (0, 2)
+ A6 f (2, 1) + A7 f (1, 2) + A8 f (2, 2)
where
A0 = cos(ω0 ) − s
A2 = 1 − cos(ω2 )

A1 = 1 − cos(ω1 )
A3 = 1 − cos(ω1 )cos(ω2 )

A4 = 1 − cos(2ω1 )
A5 = 1 − cos(2ω2 )
A6 = 1 − cos(2ω1 )cos(ω2 ) A7 = 1 − cos(ω1 )cos(2ω2 )
A8 = 1 − cos(2ω1 )cos(2ω2 )

The constants Ii can be for particular shape of the contour (8) expressed analytically by closed form formulas. This analytical solution is based on the expansion
of the functions cos(αcosϕ), cos(αsinϕ), sin(αcosϕ), sin(αsinϕ) into the sum
of Bessel functions which enables analytical integration of the terms in the quadratic diﬀerence (9). For asteroidal contour deﬁned by

Rotation of the Frequency Response

The 2-dimensional zero-phase FIR ﬁlter is represented by the impulse response
h(m, n). Provided the impulse response h(m, n) is of odd length in both directions with central term h(0, 0) and with symmetry h(m, n) = h(−m, −n), then
the relations between the impulse and frequency response are as follows
N

H(ejω1 , ejω2 ) =

h(m, n)e−jmω1 e−jnω2

I order to rotate the frequency response H(ejω1 , ejω2 ) in the frequency plane we
propose the transformation of the frequency coordinates
Ω1 = ω1 cos φ − ω2 sin φ , Ω2 = ω2 cos φ + ω1 sin φ .

(16)

The impulse response hr (p, q) of the ﬁlter with the rotated frequency response
Hr (ejω1 , ejω2 ) is given by substitution of (16) into (14) and evaluating (15) in
the form
hr (p, q) =

Fig. 1. Limitations of the rotation

The frequency response Hr (ejω1 , ejω2 ) given by the impulse response hr (p, q) is
in the frequency domain rotated counterclockwise by the angle φ with respect
to the frequency response H(ejω1 , ejω2 ) given by the impulse response h(m, n).
However, we have to take into account two limitations of the rotation denoted
in Fig. 1. First, the aliasing from higher spectral periods may occur during the
rotation. For aliasing prevention the frequency response H(ejω1 , ejω2 ) should be
constant in the
√ four dashed border regions demarcated by the arcs with the
radius equal 2. Second, the regions of the frequency response H(ejω1 , ejω2 )
outside the unity circle as indicated in Fig. 1 may disappear during the rotation.
The regions of the frequency response inside the unity circle never disappear
during the rotation. Due to these limitations it is not possible to rotate the
transformation function F (ejω1 , ejω2 ) prior the McClellan transformation.

Example of the Design

In our example we demonstrate the design of the 2-D FIR low pass ﬁlter with
asteroidal contour for ω0 = 0.5 oriented counterclockwise by the angle φ = 3π/25
with respect to the frequency coordinates. We assume normalized frequencies in
the interval (−1, 1) . In the ﬁrst step we calculate the coeﬃcients of the McClellan
transformation

low pass FIR ﬁlter with 3dB-decay cut-oﬀ frequency ωstop = 0.22 of the length
17 coeﬃcients was designed using the analytical procedure presented in [6]. The
impulse response h(n) of the ﬁlter is summarized in Tab. 2. Using the transformation coeﬃcients f (p, q) and the 1-D impulse response h(n) we calculate the
