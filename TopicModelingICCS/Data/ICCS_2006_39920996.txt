Abstract. This paper studies the performance of Bluetooth broadcasting scheme. The transmission of a Bluetooth broadcast packet is repeated
several times to increase the reliability of broadcast. We have analyzed
the eﬀects of baseband ACL packet type preference, on the broadcast performance in terms of reliability and eﬀective throughput, over diﬀerent
channel characteristics (i.e. bit error rate). As the result of our analysis,
we determined the optimal packet type and re-transmission count combinations that can provide the highest eﬀective throughput values for
various practical BER ranges. These results can be used at Bluetooth
baseband layer to dynamically adapt to varying channel conditions and
to achieve a good broadcast performance.

Introduction

Bluetooth (BT) standard [1][2] includes a reliable broadcasting mechanism for
applications that require data packets to be sent to more than one node in a BT
piconet. Broadcasting is more energy and bandwidth eﬃcient than separately
unicasting the data to several nodes.
As broadcast packets are not acknowledged, reliability in BT broadcasting is
achieved by simply repeating the transmission of the same packet NBC times.
This causes, however, a tradeoﬀ to be made between reliability and eﬃcient
channel utilization (high eﬀective throughput).
In a BT piconet, the master node learns slaves’ desired repetition count,
NBC , and announces the new value using the LMP quality of service and LMP
quality of service req messages [2]. The master node can also determine an
appropriate packet type to be used in broadcasting, since each packet type has
diﬀerent maximum size and error protection capability (diﬀerent FEC coding).
Broadcasting uses ACL (asynchronous connectionless link) packets and there are
several types of ACL packets [2][3]. Hence it is possible for the master node to
select the best combination for the packet type and repetition count in order to
make a good tradeoﬀ between reliability and throughput.

In this work, we have investigated the optimum values for packet types and
retransmission counts in terms of their eﬀects on channel utilization under different bit error rates with a custom simulator. As far as we know this is the
ﬁrst paper that analyzes the BT broadcasting scheme in terms of throughput
and reliability. In the next section we describe our methodology and simulation
model. Then we provide our results and discussions.

Methodology and Simulation Model

A master node can acquire feedback about the channel condition and about the
eﬃciency of broadcasting using the BT link manager messages. After broadcasting a certain number of packets to slaves, the master can poll the slaves so that
the slaves can inform the master about the NBC values they want the master
to use. The desired NBC value can be computed by a slave based on the quality
of the reception and this value corresponds to a BER range. In order to ensure
a minimum reliability level for all slaves, largest NBC feedback should be taken
into account. Then, the master can choose the most appropriate packet type and
repetition count based on these oﬄine calculations and the desired NBC feedback from the slaves. This can be achieved without modifying the broadcasting
mechanism deﬁned in the BT speciﬁcation [2].
A BT baseband packet consists of mainly three parts: an access code, a packet
header, and the payload. The header is protected by 1/3 FEC with whitening,
providing an aggregate code distance of d0 =6, so the code is capable of correcting
all single and detecting all quadruple errors [4]. The access code is assumed to
be protected by pseudo-random noise along with the expurgated code, which
provides large Hamming distances (dmin = 14). The trailer is a 4 bit pattern
of either 1010 or 0101, and is used for DC compensation. Thus, the errors on
access code and trailer are going to be ignored in the simulator [5].
DH packet payloads do not employ any protection scheme and error detection
is achieved using CRC bits added to the end of the packets. Payloads of DM
packets are protected by 2/3 FEC (10/15 shortened Hamming Code), i.e. it can
correct all single bit and detect all double bit errors in a 15 bit block.
The analytical approach discussed in [6] clearly reﬂects the BER and Packet
Loss Rate (PLR) relationship. For packet types without FEC protection, the
packet loss rate p is related to BER and payload size s (in bits) with the formula
p = 1 − (1 − BER)s

(1)

For packets with 2/3 FEC protection, 15 bits are used to encode 10 bits of data,
and this can correct one bit in every 15 bits. So the packet loss rate p becomes:
p = 1 − ((1 − BER)15 + 15 × BER × (1 − BER)14 )s/15

(2)

In our simulations, when the packet type is speciﬁed, our simulator calculates
PLR from BER and payload size. During the simulations, number of packets

lost and the amount of data successfully transported are recorded. These values
are then used to calculate eﬀective throughput (goodput) and reliability. Eﬀective throughput is expected to decrease when the NBC value increases, since
several packets occupying the channel contain the same data. Using large packets increases throughput, on the other hand using FEC decreases the eﬀective
throughput due to redundant bits inserted into packets. We deﬁne reliability as
the ratio of correctly received packets to the packets transmitted. Various applications may require diﬀerent degrees of reliability in terms of correct delivery
of baseband broadcast packets to slaves from a master. Increasing NBC or using FEC protection increases reliability. In contrast enlarging packet payload,
increases PLR and therefore reduces reliability.
We performed simulations to ﬁnd out the repetition counts and packet types
that will yield the maximum throughput for a given reliability range.

Simulation Results

We simulated the BT broadcast mechanism for various practical RF channel
BER values. For each BER value that is ﬁxed, we have evaluated the performance
of each of the BT baseband packet types in terms of reliability and throughput.
The 95% conﬁdence interval of the simulation results are very tight and they
are not discernible from the graphs. In the presented results, we have only depicted conﬁdence mean values that are obtained from batches of 10 independent
simulation runs in which the master sends 5 MBs worth of broadcast data.
Performance of packet types under various BER values is closely related to
each packet’s vulnerability to error, which depends on packet payload size and
the FEC scheme employed. In order to present the eﬀect of NBC on reliability
more clearly, we have simulated the broadcasting scenario for a ﬁxed BER of
10−3 . Figure 1 shows that relatively small values of NBC is suﬃcient for DM
packets to provide reliable transmission. On the other hand, lack of FEC protection causes DH packets to exhibit poor performance. Finally, using packets
with larger payloads reduces reliability, whereas increasing NBC yields more
reliable broadcasts. When a desired level of reliability is speciﬁed, it is possible to ﬁnd optimal packet types and NBC values that satisfy this constraint
while providing maximum achievable throughput. Figure 2 show the maximum
throughput obtained by ACL packet types under reliability constraints of 99.9%.
As BER is increased, NBC value is increased to satisfy reliability constraint and
consequently maximum throughput decreases. The packet type that exhibits
the best throughput performance changes over the practical BER range. Optimal repetition count and packet selection for 99.9% reliability is tabulated in
Table 1.
Having received the desired NBC values from the slaves, piconet master can
ﬁnd the corresponding BER according to the packet type being used in broadcast. The master can look up for optimal packet type and NBC value in Table 1
using this BER value.

Conclusion

In this paper, we analyze the Bluetooth broadcasting scheme and provide results
that can be used to improve broadcasting throughput and reliability. We used
previously covered methods of reliability calculations in Bluetooth to come up
with a novel method to create an adaptive packet type and repetition count
(NBC ) selection scheme. We observed that our scheme can successfully improve
the performance of current Bluetooth broadcasting scheme (in terms of throughput and reliability) for various radio channel conditions.
