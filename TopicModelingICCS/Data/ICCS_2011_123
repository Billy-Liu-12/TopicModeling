Abstract
Alternative channels of the tungsten imido-catalysed olefin dimerisation proceeding through mono(imido) and bis(imido)
compounds have been examined by means of the DFT method simulating authentic reaction conditions on catalyst models that
closely mimic the real catalyst system. All relevant steps of a plausible metallacycle mechanism to follow alternative pathways
together with the divergent path towards azatungstanacycle intermediates have been characterised by considering up to three
AlClMe2 moieties explicitly. This study disclosed that the Lewis acid is actively engaged in the productive catalytic cycle, this in
addition to its presumed role, among others, as alkylating and chloride ligand abstraction agent in the formation of the active
catalyst species. The Lewis acid preferably forms four-membered chelates across tungsten–imido or tungsten–chlorine bonds
featuring a P-Al–Cl–W bridge. The formation of the five-membered tungstanacycle is found to be less affected by the cocatalyst,
but it acts profoundly in modulating the energetics of its degradation into the dimer product. DFT predicts a smooth energy
profile for the most accessible path via mono(imido) tungsten species, having the Lewis acid bridged across tungsten–chlorine
bonds, which is in consonance with observed activity and selectivity. This type of Lewis acid association appears as being pivotal
for an effective catalysis. The alternative channel to engage bis(imido) tungsten compounds features significantly more
demanding kinetics for the dimer generating route, thereby rendering it as being almost impossible to be accessed. The present
study constitutes evidence, based on reliable DFT calculations, that mono(imido) tungsten compounds complexed by the Lewis
acid component is effectively triggering dimerisation, whilst bis(imido) tungsten species are unlikely to play a role in the
productive cycle.

1. Introduction
The dimerisation of low number D-olefins by homogeneous catalysts is an attractive, direct route towards specific
higher olefins and represents an area of commercial and also academic significance [1]. This process has seen
substantial research efforts in recent years [2]. A variety of catalyst systems has been reported for dimerising olefins,
most of which yield branched dimers [1, 2], but certain late transition metal-based catalysts display abilities for
linear dimerisation [3-6]. On the other hand, applications of group 6 metals are rather limited [2, 7], although of

recent advances in the development of chromium systems capable of trimerising ethylene selectively to 1-hexene [8,
9] and exhibiting some selectivity towards the tetramer, 1-octene [10].
Tungsten imido compounds are one of the rare examples, which have recently been reported of being capable
dimerising D-olefins [11]. Catalyst systems prepared by treating a tungsten source (WCl6 as an example) with one or
two molar equivalents of aniline, together with the required amount of base and chloroaluminium alkyl activator of
the type AlClnRm (m+n=3), both exhibit high selectivity towards dimerisation [11]. Hence, mono(imido) and
bis(imido) tungsten compounds can be envisaged as triggering dimerisation catalysis (Scheme 1). A huge excess of
the cocatalyst is often used for various oligomerisation and polymerisation catalyst systems [1, 2], where the
cocatalyst is thought to play several roles in the generation of the active catalysts including the alkylation of
transition metal chloride precursors, alkyl ligand abstraction to afford cationic transition metal species and
scavenging of impurities. In contrast, the title reaction requires a distinct amount of the cocatalyst (~15 molar
equivalents) [11], thereby alluding to a specific function of the Lewis acid in the productive catalytic cycle.
However, little is known about the identity of the catalytically active species, which has not been unravelled thus
far.
Utilising DFT calculations as a powerful tool capable of aiding in a broader understanding, we have recently
examined selected steps of the dimerisation course for mono(imido) and bis(imido) tungsten catalysts, the key
findings of which were disclosed previously [12]. Herein we report further computational studies on structural and
energetic aspects of key intermediates, discussing competing pathways and comparing the alternative dimerisation
channels depicted in Scheme 1. This will lead us to demonstrate theoretically the impact of the Lewis acid on
dimerisation catalysis, to provide evidence for the identity of the catalytically competent species and to assign the
turnover-limiting step.

2. Catalytic reaction course
Scheme 1 shows a plausible mechanistic scenario involving metallacycle intermediates, which have been
unequivocally established for chromium-mediated ethylene oligomerisation and polymerization [13, 14]. Treatment
of the WCl6 starting material with one or two molar equivalents of aniline and the required amount of base gives
initially rise to [W(NPh)Cl4] [15] and [W(NPh)2Cl2] [16], which then leads presumably in situ to [W(NPh)R2Cl2]
(1m) and [W(NPh)2R2] (1b) compounds, respectively, in the presence of the cocatalyst. The effective catalysis first
entails conversion of 1m, 1b into the bis(olefin) species 2m, 2b, which represent the active catalyst species of the
alternative dimerisation channels proceeding through mono(imido) and bis(imido) tungsten species. Oxidative

coupling of the olefin moieties generates the tungstana(IV)cyclopentane 3. Its degradation to follow either the
concerted 1,3-H transfer or a stepwise mechanism affords the dimer product. The latter has been found as being
favourable for the conformationally rigid five-membered metallacycle intermediate [17] and comprises of
consecutive E-H abstraction and reductive CH elimination with an intervening W–H–alkenyl intermediate 4.
Repeated olefin insertion into consecutively enlarged metallacycle fragments, to first yield the
tungstana(IV)cycloheptane 5, and subsequent degradation would lead to larger oligomers. Alternatively, olefin
attack at the tungstenimido linkage to form the azatungstanacycle 6 in a [2 + 2] cycloaddition would open a
possible route that leads to catalyst deactivation.
3. Computational model and method
Model: Herein is reported the computational survey of alternative channels of the imido tungsten-mediated olefin
dimerisation, with ethylene served as a prototypical D-olefin substrate. The catalyst model was chosen in such a
fashion to closely mimic the real catalyst system [11]. This study employed [W(NC6H5)Cl2(C2H4)2] and
[W(NC6H5)2(C2H4)2] to represent 1m, 1b, together with AlClMe2 as Lewis acid component. We performed an
extensive DFT simulation of configurationally and conformationally different reaction pathways involving up to
three AlClMe2 moieties, the most favourable of which are reported herein. Lewis acid association/dissociation and
reorganisation have been probed for the various intermediates, but found to occur in an essentially barrierless
fashion. This has been examined in a linear-transit approach, as the exact localisation of the TS structures is
complicated by the flatness of the PES in these regions. Key species of the reaction course were denoted
consistently with Arabic numbers as shown in Scheme 1, augmented by m or b characters to indicate mono(imido)
and bis(imido) tungsten species, respectively.
Method: All DFT calculations were performed with the program package TURBOMOLE [18] using the TPSS
density functional [19] in conjunction with flexible basis sets of triple-] quality. For W we used the
StuttgartíDresden quasirelativistic effective core potential (SDD) with the associate (8s7p6d)/[6s5p3d] valence
basis set [20]. All other elements were represented by Ahlrich’s valence triple-] TZVP basis set [21] with
polarization functions on all atoms. The good to excellent performance of the TPSS functional for a wide range of
applications has been demonstrated previously [22].
All stationary points were located by utilizing analytical/numerical gradients/Hessians according to standard
algorithms without imposing any symmetry constraints and were identified exactly by the curvature of the potentialenergy surface at these points corresponding to the eigenvalues of the Hessian. The reaction and activation free
energies (¨G, ¨G‡ at 298 K and 1 atm) were evaluated according to standard textbook procedures [23] using
computed harmonic frequencies. The influence of the solvent (chlorobenzene) [11] was taken into explicit
consideration by making use of a continuum model. All the key species were fully located with inclusion of
solvation by the COSMO method [24]. In order to account for real condensed-phase reaction condition, the entropy
costs for Lewis acid and olefin substrate association/dissociation processes was approximated as being two-thirds of
its gas-phase value. This approximation was successfully applied in former investigations on group 4 metal-assisted
selective olefin oligomerisation [17d, 25] and is expected to reasonably estimate the true entropy contribution in
condensed phase.
4. Results and discussion
This study is divided into two parts. The first part aims at gauging computationally what influence the cocatalyst
exerts on individual elementary steps. Important aspects already disclosed in previous communications [12] are
summarised briefly, but will be extended by the exploration of alternative modes for Lewis acid association and of
rival pathways. The most accessible routes of the alternative dimerisation channels will be compared in the second
part.

We start with the assessment of the strength of Lewis acid association onto the key intermediate of the
dimerisation course, viz. tungstanacycle 3. The analysis is confined to interactions of the cocatalyst with the
immediate environment around the tungsten centre. Hence, up to three and two AlClMe2 moieties, respectively,
have been explicitly considered for 3m and 3b. Off the various tested association modes, a four-membered chelate
featuring a P-Al–Cl–W bridge revealed as being favourable. Two different motifs are seen in Fig. 1 for 3m, where
the Lewis acid bridges the tungsten–imido bond (type A) or exclusively the tungsten–chlorine bond (type B). The
dianionic imido ligand acts as net six-electron donor to the electron-deficient tungsten centre in unbound 3m-0, as it
is evident from the near linear tungsten–imido linkage (әW=N–R = 178°) [26]. Complexation at the chlorine centre
weakens somewhat the equatorial W–Cl bond, which is near-balanced by new WѧCl and AlѧCl dative bonds, but
leaving the tungsten–imido bond unaffected. Type B adducts are thus the preferred of the two association motifs,
with 3m-IB and 3m-IIB are only moderately uphill (Fig. 1). This contrasts with type A adducts, where the
generation of a NimideѧAl interaction provokes substantial electronic reorganisations at the nitrogen centre,
effectively attenuating the tungsten–imido bond to a degree that cannot be compensated for by the newly formed
dative bonds. As a result, 3m-IA, 3m-IIA and 3m-IIIA are thermodynamically highly unfavourable (Fig. 1).
A different situation arises for uncomplexed 3b-0, where the imido’s lone pairs share the same vacant tungsten
orbital. Hence, some proportion of the lone pair’s density remains localised on each nitrogen atom, as manifested in
two distinctly bent imido moieties (әW=N–R = 161°) showing equally lengthened W=NR bonds (1.796 Å, Fig. 1).
The higher basicity of Nimide centres makes bis(imido) tungsten(VI) compounds more susceptible towards Lewis
acid bridging across the arylimido–tungsten linkage than their mono(imido) cousins. Chelation of one of the imido
groups greatly benefits from the second unbound imido group acting stabilising as a net six electron donor (әW=N–
R = 179°, 1.765 Å). Species 3b-I has been predicted previously by us as the favourable and stable Lewis acid adduct
of a bis(imido) tungsten(VI) compound (Fig. 1).
The four-membered chelates depicted in Fig. 1 are seldom reported in literature [27, 28]. One notable example is
the X-ray structure of an AlMe3 adduct of a titanium imido methyl cation featuring two bridged methyl groups [28].
Supportive DFT calculations by the same authors have indicated that steric factors govern the observed association
mode, whilst bridging the titanium–imido bond is preferred electronically. Alternative forms of AlClMe2 association
onto 3m, 3b featuring a P-Al–Me–W bridge have been probed explicitly, the relative stabilities, given in
parenthesises, are collected in Fig. 1. This clearly shows the greater aptitude of the chlorine donor centre to
participate in AlClMe2 association.

mol-1) slightly exergonic process, thus proceeding in a reversible fashion. Olefin coupling remains mainly
thermoneutral but becoming more demanding kinetically upon cocatalyst complexation, as the barrier roughly
doubles in size for mono(imido) and somewhat less for bis(imido) species. Nonetheless, formation of tungstanacycle
3 appears as being most facile among all relevant steps, thus not likely affecting the catalytic behaviour.

4.1.3. Reactivity of 3 towards olefin substrate
The analysis of divergent paths starts by assessing the reactivity of 3 towards olefin substrate. The tungstanacycle
imido intermediate has two potential sites for olefin attack, viz. the metallacycle fragment and the tungsten–imido
linkage. Table 2 collects the energetics for 3 + C2H4 ѧ5 metallacycle growth and 3 + C2H4 ѧ6 [2 + 2]
cycloaddition to commence from 3m and 3b having the AlClMe2 activator complexed in various modes. As a
general feature of both processes, olefin approach is indicated to not be associated with a substantial enthalpic
barrier [29].
Ethylene insertion into the WVI–C bond of the metallacycle fragment evolves through a transition-state (TS)
structure comprising a quasi-planar four-membered cis arrangement of the WVI–C bond and the coplanar oriented
ethylene substrate. Considering the pathways associated with 3m-IB and 3b-II precursors as representative
examples, the type B chelate stays in its original form during the whole process, whilst accommodation of incoming
substrate onto 3b-II goes along with the partial rupture of one chelate, having the NimideѧAl interaction still intact,
which becomes rebuilt in 5.
The 3 + C2H4 ѧ6 olefin cycloaddition across the tungsten–imido linkage proceeds via a four-membered TS
structure having the two reactive bonds arranged near-coplanar. Cycloaddition commencing from 3m-IB involves a
product-like TS structure exhibiting significantly elongated tungsten–imido and olefin double bonds together with a
relatively short new N–C bond (1.62 Å). In contrast, TS[3–6]m-IA features a very weak NimideѧAl interaction, as
olefin attack at the arylimido group reduces its aptitude for cocatalyst association. Unsurprisingly, we have not been
able to locate the TS for other type A modes IIA, IIIA. Concerning bis(imido) species, azacycle formation does
occur at an earlier stage via a reactant-like TS structure.
The alternative steps exhibit similar kinetics for a given pathway involving mono(imido) or bis(imido)
compounds (Table 2). This suggests a comparable likelihood for 3 + C2H4 ѧ5 and 3 + C2H4 ѧ6 being traversed
from a kinetics point of view. Noteworthy, AlClMe2 association does not discriminate between these steps.
However, thermodynamics appears as being the discriminating factor. The growth of the metallacycle fragment is in
most cases exergonic, driven by a moderate thermodynamic force (Table 2). On the other hand, the
azatungstanacycle 6 is thermodynamically highly unfavourable (Table 2), thereby suggesting that the reverse 6ѧ3 +
C2H4 step is significantly more facile than 3 + C2H4ѧ6 azacycle formation. This led us to conclude that for both 3m
and 3b the WVI–C bond is the preferential target for olefin attack.
Metallacycle growth has computed barriers of 35.0 and 23.2 kcal mol-1 for unbound species 3m-0 and 3b-0,
respectively (Table 2). Type B Lewis acid complexation at W–Cl bonds of 3m (IB, IIB, cf. Fig. 1) leaves the energy
profile almost unchanged, whilst type A chelation (IA, IIA, IIIA, cf. Fig. 1) provokes an increase of the barrier by
6–7 kcal mol-1 (Table 2). A similar behaviour is seen for 3b. Ethylene insertion into 3b-I, where the second unbound
imido ligand acts as a regulating factor (see above), exhibits an energy profile that is almost degenerate to that for
3b-0. The reduction of the donor ability of both imido groups upon AlClMe2 complexation increases the insertion
barrier by ~10 kcal mol-1 (II, Table 2). Overall, the computational analysis presented thus far has disclosed that the
cocatalyst exerts a moderate effect onto the formation and growth of tungstanacycle 3, this in contrast to its
profound influence on metallacycle degradation (see below).

4.1.4. Degradation of 3
Degradation of the five-membered tungstanacycle to furnish the dimer product can either proceed though the
stepwise mechanism depicted in Scheme 1, or alternatively via concerted 1,3-H transfer. The energetics of the two
examined mechanisms is summarised in Table 3. Previous computational studies of the selective ethylene
trimerisation by group 4 [17b-d], 5 [17a] and 6 [30] metal catalysts have provided significant evidence for the
stepwise mechanism being preferential for the rigid five-membered metallacycle, whilst degradation of
conformationally more flexible metallacycles follows the concerted pathway.
Starting with the stepwise degradation of mono(imido) and bis(imido) tungstanacycles, exemplified again for
pathways linked to 3m-IB and 3b-II, the former sees some seemingly facile rearrangements of the bridging
AlClMe2 moiety at earlier stages until the TS for EH-abstraction is reached, in order to accommodate the shifted
hydrogen. Decay of the TS leads to 4m-IB having the alkenyl double bond complexed at the tungsten centre. The
isomer where the alkenyl moiety is K1-coordinated to the metal by is alkenyl terminus, although entropically
favourable, does not represent the starting point for reductive CH-elimination (RE) evolving through the minimumenergy TS. This process does benefit from the coordinative stabilisation of the TS by the alkenyl double bond.
Whilst passing through the TS for E-H abstraction from 3b-II, one of the Lewis acid chelates is partially cleaved,
but re-associates again in 4b-II bearing a K1-alkenyl moiety. Ensuing reductive dimer release evolves through an
early TS structure that occurs at a distance of 1.35 Å for CH bond formation.
The availability of a vacant tungsten acceptor orbital is the major electronic factor that determines the kinetics of
E-H abstraction [12]. Suitable tungsten orbitals, however, are unavailable for unbound 3m-0 and also for type B
adducts 3m-IB, 3m-IIB, hence giving rise to an almost uniform barrier of ~30 kcal mol-1 (Table 3). Type A
AlClMe2 complexation, although thermodynamically unfavourable (see above), alleviates the kinetic blockage by
the strong imido donor, which leads to a significant acceleration ('G‡ ~20 kcal mol-1 for 3m-IA, 3m-IIA, 3m-IIIA,
cf. Table 3). A similar situation is seen for bis(imido) species. The rather small change in activation energy for 3b-I
relative to unbound 3b-0 is understandable, again, from the regulating influence of the second net six-electron donor
imido group. Saturation of the immediate proximity around the tungsten centre by cocatalyst complexation, which
amplifies the electrophilicity of the tungsten centre, facilitates the reductive elimination for the mono(imido)
compound [12a], as the barrier decreases regularly upon increasing the number of associated AlClMe2 moieties
(Table 3). On the other hand, the unconquerable barrier for unbound species bis(imido) compound ('G‡ = 72.4 kcal
mol-1, Table 3) drops substantially after confining the imido’s donor capacity by cocatalyst complexation.
In light of the rather demanding stepwise degradation of 3b, it may be conceivable that the concerted 1,3-H
transfer, although demonstrated to be far less accessible for the conformationally rigid five-membered metallacycle
[17], is predominant here. The TS structure associated with 3b-II features two nearly equidistant CE–H and CD’–H
bonds, thus indicating a synchronous hydrogen shift, with the two chelates remaining intact. The Lewis acid appears
to influence the precursor and TS in a comparable fashion, hence giving rise to a barrier of ~40–45 kcal mol-1 for

1210

3b-I and 3b-II that is similar to what is calculated for 3b-0 (Table 3). Given the size of this barrier it seems rather
unlikely that the concerted mechanism becomes preferential for the mono(imido) tungstanacycle.
In conclusion, the stepwise mechanism is operative for dimer generation via mono(imido) and bis(imido)
compounds. The computational survey has unveiled that the Lewis acid acts profoundly in smoothing the energy
profile.

4.2. Comparison of alternative dimerisation channels
Having assessed to what extent the cocatalyst affects individual steps, we now compare the located most
accessible paths of the alternative channels shown in Scheme 1. It takes the tungstana(VI)cyclopentane intermediate
3 as the reference point, this in light of the previous findings that the oxidative coupling is a facile and basically
thermoneutral step (see above) [31]. Starting the analysis with unbound species 3m-0, 3b-0, DFT predicts an almost
insurmountable barrier for its degradation ('G‡RE-CH = 42.4 and 72.4 kcal mol-1, respectively) in conjunction with a
kinetically easier growth to furnish 5 ('G‡INS = 35.0 and 23.2 kcal mol-1, respectively). Accordingly, dimer
formation is almost entirely prevented and larger oligomers should likely be formed instead. This contrasts sharply
with observed dimerisation abilities [11], thereby demonstrating that effective catalysis necessitates the active
participation of the cocatalyst in the productive cycle; this in addition to its presumed role, among others, as
alkylating and/or anion abstracting agent in the process of generating of the active catalyst.
Moving now to the realistic scenario where the Lewis acid does participate, the located most accessible pathway
for the mono(imido) catalyst compound evolves through species where AlClMe2 bridges the tungstenchlorine bond
in a four-membered chelate (Fig. 2). The operative stepwise mechanism for tungstanacycle degradation exhibits a
double-well profile with a sufficiently stable, transient intermediate 4, which can be expected as being to some
extent populated. It may thus seem likely that seemingly facile AlClMe2 association/dissociation does occur at this
stage of the process. The first E-H abstraction has the higher barrier, thereby determining the effective kinetics of
dimer formation. Notably, one AlClMe2 moiety does participate in this step (commencing from 3-IB), whilst the
consecutive reductive CH-elimination does benefit from two cocatalyst moieties (commencing from 4-IIB). DFT
predicts E-H abstraction as being turnover limiting having a barrier of 31.0 kcal mol-1, whilst competing olefin
insertion into the metallacycle fragment ('G‡ = 35.0 kcal mol-1 for 3m-0 + C2H4ѧ5m-0) and [2 + 2] cycloaddition
with the arylimido functionality ('G‡ = 36.2 kcal mol-1 for 3m-0 + C2H4ѧ6m-0) are significantly less probable,
thereby rendering these routes almost impossible to traverse. All these aspects consistently reflect observed activity
and selectivity, hence aid in rationalising the catalyst’s abilities.
Lewis acid association at both arylimido functionalities appeared as being most effective in smoothing the
energetics of dimer formation for the bis(imido) compound (see above). Degradation of 3b-II displays a similar
double-well profile, but with reductive elimination is now kinetically more demanding (Fig. 2). The associated

Sven Tobisch. / Procedia Computer Science 4 (2011) 1203–1213

1211

substantial total barrier of 48.1 kcal mol-1 indicates that this is likely not a viable step at operating reaction
conditions. Instead, olefin attack at the two reactive sites of 3b-I is clearly preferred kinetically ('G‡ = 22.6/24.7
kcal mol-1 for 3b-I + C2H4ѧ5b-I/6b-I), such that the dimer generating path stays closed throughout.
The present computational survey constitutes some evidence that a mono(imido) tungsten compound, having the
Lewis acid associated in a chelating fashion across one or two tungsten–chlorine bonds, can trigger dimerisation.
This type of specific catalyst-cocatalyst interaction appears as being pivotal for achieving effective catalysis.
Bis(imido) tungsten compounds, on the other hand, are indicated to not be responsible for observed catalyst’s
abilities. This raises questions concerning the identity of the active species for the case when a 1:2 molar ratio of
tungsten and aniline starting materials is used [11]. It could also be a mono(imido) species, which may imply the
abstraction of one imido ligand induced by the Lewis acid [32]. However, this aspect is beyond the scope of the
present study and will be subjected to forthcoming studies.

5. Concluding remarks
Tungsten imido compounds, when activated by a distinct amount of AlClnRm (m+n=3) cocatalyst, have been
recently reported of being capable dimerising D-olefins [11]. However, little is known about the identity of the
catalytically active species and the precise function of the Lewis acid component. Herein is reported a
comprehensive computational survey of alternative dimerisation channels to engage mono(imido) and bis(imido)
tungsten compounds on a realistic catalyst model and authentic reaction conditions. We performed an extensive
DFT simulation of configurationally and conformationally different reaction pathways involving up to three
AlClMe2 moieties for all relevant steps of a plausible metallacycle mechanism. Furthermore, catalyst deactivation
through formation of azatungstanacycle intermediates has been examined. The calculated reaction energy profile for
unbound tungsten imido compounds is at odds with observed dimerisation abilities. The present study unveiled that
effective catalysis necessitates the active participation of the Lewis acid component in the productive cycle, this in
addition of its presumed role in the process of forming the active catalyst species. The AlClMe2 component
preferably forms four-membered chelates across tungsten–imido and tungsten–chlorine bonds featuring a P-Al–Cl–
W bridge. This does moderately affect the formation of the five-membered tungstanacycle key intermediate, but the
Lewis acid acts profoundly in modulating the energetics of its degradation to furnish the dimer product. Of the
alternative reaction channels, DFT predicts a smooth reaction profile for the most accessible path through
mono(imido) tungsten compounds, with AlClMe2 bridges across tungsten–chlorine bonds. This specific catalystcocatalyst association mode appears as being pivotal for achieving effective catalysis. The E-H abstraction is
turnover determining with a barrier of 31.0 kcal mol-1 to furnish the dimer, whilst the route towards higher

oligomers is well separated and kinetically almost inaccessible. All these aspects are in consonance with observed
activity and selectivity. The reaction channel through bis(imido) tungsten compounds displays a significantly more
demanding energy profile, hence rendering it almost impossible to traverse. This implies that bis(imido) tungsten
compounds are unlikely to play a role in the productive dimerisation course.

31 An almost quantitative and sufficiently facile transformation of the starting materials into the bis(olefin) active catalyst species 2 is
furthermore assumed. A practicable route has been previously suggested for bis(imido) tungsten compounds (see ref. 12b)
32 There is some presence for such processes, for instance in metathesis catalysis; see, for example: R.R Schrock and A.H. Hoveyda, Angew.
Chem., Int. Ed. 42 (2003) 4592.
