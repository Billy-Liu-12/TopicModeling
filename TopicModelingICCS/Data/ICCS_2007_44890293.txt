Abstract. The black and white traveling salesman problem (BWTSP) is a new
class of NP-hard problem arising from work on airline scheduling and
telecommunication fiber networks. The existing Ghiani LP for the undirected
BWTSP contains an exponential number of constraints. For a special case of the
directed BWTSP whose L = +∞ , the LP with polynomial number of constraints
could be obtained by transforming it to an asymmetric traveling salesman
problem with replenishment arcs (RATSP), whereas there exists no LP for the
directed BWTSP in its general form. This paper proposes a LP with 3n 2 + 2n
constraints only for the directed BWTSP in such a way that, by reducing the
problem to an asymmetric traveling salesman problem (ATSP), we add
n 2 cardinality constraints and n 2 length constraints to the existing GavishGrave LP for the ATSP. The new LP is also valid for the undirected BWTSP
when viewed as a special case of the directed BWTSP.
Keywords: Black and white traveling salesman problem, Linear programming,
Gavish-Grave LP.

1 Introduction
The black and white traveling salesman problem (BWTSP) is a generalization of the
well known traveling salesman problem (TSP) and is therefore NP-hard. Given a
directed graph G = (V , A) or an undirected graph G = (V , E ) with vertex set

V = {1,

, n} , arc set A = {(i, j ) : i, j ∈ V , i ≠ j} or edge set E = {(i, j ) : i, j ∈ V , i ≠ j} ,

and costs on the arcs c ∈ R or costs on the edges c ∈ R , the BWTSP is to find a
shortest Hamiltonian tour on G . However the tour must satisfy additional constraints
i) cardinality constraints: the vertex set V is partitioned into black vertices, denoted
by B ( B ≥ 2 ) and white vertices, denoted by W = V \ B , the number of white

vertices between two consecutive black vertices on the tour does not exceed a positive
integer Q , and ii) length constraints: the length of any path or chain between two
consecutive black vertices does not exceed a positive value L .
An application of the BWTSP arises in the design of telecommunication fiber
networks using the SONET technology [1, 2]. When designing survivable fiber

networks using the SONET technology, one seeks a shortest Hamiltonian cycle
comprising hubs (white vertices) and ring offices (black vertices) with upper bounds
on both the number of hubs and chain length between consecutive ring offices. Aside
the above-mentioned application, the scheduling of airline operations that incorporate
maintenance connections [3] can also be modeled as a BWTSP.
Ghiani et al. have shown a linear programming (LP) with exponential constraints for
the undirected BWTSP, whereas no LP exists for the directed BWTSP in its general
form. With the special case of the directed BWTSP whose Q = L = +∞ is associated
extensive existing LPs by reverting to the usual ATSP (see [5]). Dantzig et al. [6]
introduced a conventional LP with 2 n −1 − n − 1 constraints in 1954. Miller et al. [7]
presented a sequential LP with n 2 − n + 2 constraints in 1960. A single commodity
flow based LP with n(n + 2) constraints was proposed by Gavish et al. [8] in 1978. In
1983 Finke et al. [9] developed a two-commodity flow based LP with n(n + 4)
constraints. Wong [10] and Claus [11] described the multi-commodity flow based LP
with n 3 + n 2 + 6n − 3 constraints, respectively, in 1980 and 1984. Besides a time staged
LP with 2n 2 − n + 3 constraints by Vajda [12] in 1961, Fox et al. [13] showed two time
staged LPs in 1980, one with 4n − 1 constraints, the other with n( n + 2) constraints.
When L = +∞ , the directed BWTSP reduced to an asymmetric traveling salesman
problem with replenishment arcs (RATSP). The natural arc LP for the RATSP was
developed by Zhu [14] based on the DFJ formulation for the ATSP in 1994. Boland et
al. [15] proposed a path LP for the same problem in 2000. Both of the previously
mentioned LPs involve exponentially many variables and constraints. Vicky [16]
strengthened the LP by Zhu, and proposed a polynomial-size LP.
In this paper we propose a new LP with polynomial constraints for the directed
BWTSP in its general form. The directed BWTSP reduces to an ATSP when
Q = L = ∞ , thus we can derive our LP from the Gavish-Grave LP [8] for the ATSP.
The new n 2 formulations of cardinality constraints are obtained in such a way that,
by introducing cardinality flow representing the number of white vertices quota
remaining, we investigate the conditions that the arcs on the tour should be subject to.
Similarly, we obtain n 2 formulations of length constraints. Therefore, we establish
the new LP with 3n 2 + 2n constraints for the original problem. The new LP is also
valid for the undirected BWTSP when viewed as a special case of the directed
BWTSP. The results of the paper can promote the complete algorithm design of the
BWTSP.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the
Gavish-Grave LP for the ATSP. Cardinality constraints and length constraints are
presented in section 3 and in section 4, respectively, followed by conclusions in
section 5.

2 Gavish-Grave LP for the ATSP
As mentioned before, the directed BWTSP reduces to an ATSP when Q = L = ∞ ,
thus any solution to the directed BWTSP is feasible for the ATSP, and all inequalities

for the ATSP are also valid for the directed BWTSP. Therefore, we are able to derive
our LP from the Gavish-Grave LP.
We define xij as a binary variable equal to 1 iff arc (i, j ) belongs to the solution.
To eliminate subtours, we introduce yij as a continuous variable which represents the
commodity flow in arc (i, j ) . The Gavish-Grave LP for the ATSP can be described as
follows.

In this LP, constraints (2)-(4) are degree constraints which insure that exactly one
arc enters and leaves each vertex. Whereas constraints (5)-(7) are called arc
constraints which guarantee that the solution contains exactly one loop. Assume that
the solution contains more than one loop, all of them distinct. Consider a loop
t = (i0 , i1 ,..., ik , i0 ) which does not contain vertex 1. From (5) and (7) it follows that

yi j−1i j − yi j i( j+1) mod( k +1) = 1 for all j = 1,..., k , therefore we have yi0 i1 = yik i0 + k , nevertheless
from (7) it follows that yik i0 − yi0 i1 = 1 . No loops can exist that do not contain vertex 1;
since vertex 1 is contained in exactly one loop, thus at most one loop is generated.
The Gavish-Grave LP consists of n(n + 2) constraints, n(n − 1) 0-1 variables and

n(n − 1) continuous variables.

3 Cardinality Constraints
We define p = (i0 , i1 ,..., ik ) as a black-to-black path with (i j −1 , i j ) ∈ A for all

j = 1,..., k , i j ≠ il for all distinct j , l ∈ {0,..., k} , and i0 , ik ∈ B, i j ∈ W for all
j = 1,..., k − 1 . We also define V ( p) = {i0 , i1 ,..., ik } as the vertices on p ,
A( p) = {(i0 , i1 ), (i1 , i2 ),..., (ik −1 , ik )} as the arcs on p , and f ( p ) = ci0 i1 + ci1i2 + ... + cik −1ik as
the length of p . A black-to-black path p is said to be feasible if the number of white

296

vertices on it does not exceed Q , i.e. V ( p ) − 2 ≤ Q , and the length of it does not
exceed L , i.e. f ( p ) ≤ L . Otherwise it is said to be infeasible. Obviously, a feasible
solution of the BWTSP consists of alternating feasible black-to-black paths.
To eliminate cardinality violation, we introduce extra cardinality flow qij for each
(i, j ) ∈ A , which represents the number of white vertices quota remaining after
visiting arc (i, j ) . Then our cardinality constraints can be derived as follows.
The total cardinality flow into a white vertex j ∈ W will be 1 more than that out of
j . Therefore, we have the following constraint:

∑

i≠ j

qij − ∑ z ≠ j q jz = 1

∀j ∈ W

(8)

And the total cardinality flow out of each black vertex j ∈ B should not exceed Q
in order to guarantee that, the number of white vertices on the black-to-black path
starting with vertex j does not exceed Q .

∑

i≠ j

q ji ≤ Q

∀j ∈ B

(9)

Last of all, qij is bounded according to:
0 ≤ qij ≤ Qxij

∀i, j ∈ B ∪ W , i ≠ j

(10)

Constraints (8), (9) and (10) are formulations of cardinality constraints which impose
the maximum number restriction of white vertices between consecutive black vertices.
These formulations consist of n 2 constraints and n(n − 1) new continuous variables.
Proposition 1. Constraints (8), (9) and (10) are valid for the directed BWTSP.
Proof. Assume that a solution of the directed BWTSP subject to constraints (8), (9)
and (10) violates the cardinality constraints. Thus, there must be a black-to-black path
p = (i0 , i1 ,..., ik ) on the solution subject to k − 2 ≥ Q . From (8) and (10) it follows that

qir ir +1 = qir+1ir +2 + 1 for all r = 0,..., k − 2 . Therefore, we have qi0 i1 = qik −1ik + k − 1 > Q ,
which contradicts with constraint (9). Thus, no solution subject to (8), (9) and (10)
could exist that does not satisfy cardinality constraints.
To show that a feasible solution of the directed BWTSP satisfies (8), (9) and (10),
assume that p = (i0 , i1 ,..., ik ) is a feasible black-to-black path on the solution; (8), (9)
and (10) hold by assigning qir ir +1 = k − 1 − r , qir z = 0 for all (ir , z ) ∉ A( p ) ,
r = 0,..., k − 1 .

4 Length Constraints
To eliminate length violation, we introduce length flow lij for each (i, j ) ∈ A , which
represents the length quota remaining after visiting arc (i, j ) . Our length constraints
are derived as follows.

Using Gavish-Grave LP

297

If arc (i, j ) ∈ A ( i ∈ W ) belongs to the solution, i.e. if xij = 1 , the total length flow
out of vertex i will be cij less than that into it. To guarantee this is satisfied, we
require that if xij = 1 , then ∑ z ≠ i liz = ∑ s ≠ i lsi − cij . Therefore, we have the following
constraint:

∑

l = ∑ s ≠ i lsi − ∑ z ≠ i ciz xiz

z ≠ i iz

∀i ∈W

(11)

If arc (i, j ) ∈ A ( i ∈ B ) belongs to the solution, i.e. if xij = 1 , the total length flow
out of vertex i will be considered “refreshed” after visiting i and lij will be set to

L − cij . Thus, we obtain the following constraint:

∑

l = L − ∑ z ≠ i ciz xiz

z ≠ i iz

∀i ∈ B

(12)

Last of all, lij is bounded according to:
0 ≤ lij ≤ xij L

∀i, j ∈ B ∪ W , i ≠ j

(13)

Constraints (11), (12) and (13) are formulations of length constraints which impose
the maximum length restriction between consecutive black vertices. These
formulations consist of n 2 constraints and n(n − 1) new continuous variables.
Proposition 2. Constraints (11), (12) and (13) are valid for the directed BWTSP.
Proof. Assume that a solution subject to constraints (11), (12) and (13) violates the
length constraints. Thus, there must be a black-to-black path p = (i0 , i1 ,..., ik ) on the

solution subject to ∑ 0 ≤ r ≤ k −1 cir ir +1 > L and xir ir +1 = 1 for all r = 0,

, k − 1 . From (11) it

follows that lir +1ir +2 = lir ir+1 − cir +1ir+2 for all r = 0,..., k − 2 . Therefore, we have

lik −1ik = li0 i1 − ∑1≤ r ≤ k −1 cir ir +1 . From (12) it follows that li0 i1 = L − ci0i1 ; hence, we have
lik −1ik = L − ∑ 0≤ r ≤ k −1 cir ir+1 < 0 , which contradicts with constraint (13). Thus, no solution
subject to (11), (12) and (13) can exist that does not satisfy length constraints.
We can show that a feasible solution of the directed BWTSP satisfies (11), (12)
and (13) in a similar way as given in the proof of Proposition 1. Given a feasible
black-to-black path p = (i0 , i1 ,..., ik ) on the solution, (11), (12) and (13) hold by
assigning lir ir +1 = L − ∑ 0≤ s ≤ r cis is+1 , lir z = 0 for all (ir , z ) ∉ A( p ) , r = 0,..., k − 1 .

5 Conclusion
In this paper, we have introduced a new LP for the directed BWTSP. Compared to the
Ghiani LP with exponential constraints for the undirected BWTSP, our LP involves
3n 2 + 2n constraints only. The new LP is derived from the Gavish-Grave LP by
