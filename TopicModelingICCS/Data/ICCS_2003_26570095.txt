Abstract. In real investment situations, one desires to only minimize
downside risk or portfolio loss without aﬀecting the upside potentials.
This can be accomplished by mean semi-variance optimization but not by
mean variance. In the Black-Scholes setting, this paper proposes for the
very practical yet intractable dynamic mean semi-variance portfolio optimization problem, an almost analytical solution. It proceeds by reducing
the multi-dimensional portfolio selection problem to a one-dimensional
optimization problem, which is then expressed in terms of the normal
density, leading to a very simple and eﬃcient numerical algorithm. A
numerical comparison of the eﬃcient frontier for the mean variance and
semi-variance portfolio optimization problem is presented.

Introduction

Multi-period and continuous-time mean variance portfolio selection have been
extensively studied, see e.g. [3], [1], [9], [15], [11], [13], [7]. Dynamic programming
was successfully used in the continuous case in [15] reducing the problem to the
stochastic Ricatti diﬀerential equation within the framework of linear quadratic
stochastic control. This reduction does not, however, apply to the continuous
time mean semi-variance problem, which remains an open problem.
In real investment situations, one desires to only minimize downside risk or
portfolio loss without aﬀecting the upside potentials. This can be accomplished
by mean semi-variance optimization but not mean variance. The aim of this
paper is to provide for this intractable problem of continuous time mean semivariance portfolio optimization, an analytical approach, reducing or compressing
the multi-dimensional portfolio selection problem to a one dimensional optimization problem, and expressing it in terms of the normal density, leading to a very
simple and eﬃcient numerical implementation and algorithm.

Information Technology and Complex Systems.

Mean Semi-variance Portfolio Model

In this paper, we denote by M the transpose of a matrix or vector M = (mij ),
m

by M =
the m-dimensional real space. We
i,j mij its norm and by IR
consider a Black-Scholes type ﬁnancial market where m + 1 assets are traded
continuously on a ﬁnite horizon [0, T ]. One asset is a bond S0 (t), whose dynamics
is governed by the ordinary diﬀerential equation

dS0 (t) = rS0 (t)dt,

t ∈ [0, T ],

S0 (0) > 0,

(1)

where r (> 0) is the interest rate of the bond. The remaining m assets are stocks,
and their prices are modeled by the system of stochastic diﬀerential equations
m
j=1

dSi (t) = Si (t)(bi dt +

σij dW j (t)),

t ∈ [0, T ],

Si (0) > 0,

(2)

where bi (> r) is the drift or appreciation rate, σij are the volatility coeﬃcients, satisfying the non-degeneracy condition σσ > 0 and W (t) ≡ (W 1 (t), · · ·,
W m (t)) is an m-dimensional Brownian motion.
m
A dynamic portfolio consists of i=0 Ni (t)Si (t), where Ni (t) is the number
of shares invested in the ith asset Si . If an initial wealth X0 > 0 is invested
across the assets in this market, the total wealth at time t ≥ 0 denoted by X(t),
can be shown, e.g. [5], to follow the dynamics
dX(t) = X(t)((r(1 −

where πi denotes the proportion of the wealth X(t) invested in the i-th stock,
m
that is πi X(t) = Ni (t)Si (t), i = 1, · · · , m. Then X(t) = i=0 πi X(t), where we
m
let π0 = 1 − i=1 πi be the proportion of the investment in the bond, and call
π := (π1 , · · · , πm ) ∈ IRm the portfolio selection. Note that even though πi is
constant the actual portfolio Ni (t) is dynamic and changes over time t. We do
not constrain πi to take positive values, in other words, short-selling of stocks is
allowed. Finally, transaction costs and consumptions are not considered here.
The system (3) can be written in the vectorized form
dX(t) = X(t)((r + (b − r1) π)dt + σ πdW (t)),

X(0) = X0 ,

(4)

where 1 is the m-dimensional column vector with each component equal to 1.
To simplify notation further, we let µ = r + (b − r1) π and η = σ π. Then
dX(t) = X(t)(µdt + ηdW (t)),

X(0) = X0 .

(5)

The ﬁrst and second moments of X(t) can be easily calculated,
EX(t) = X0 eµt ,

Var X(t) = X02 e2µt (e

(6)

In ﬁnance, given a notion of risk, portfolio optimization consists of selecting
the portfolio with a given return and minimum risk. In this work, risk is measured
by the semi-variance of the terminal wealth, that is
E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2 > 0.

(7)

We note that this captures risk on the undesirable downside, when EX(T ) >
X(T ), while leaving the upside EX(T ) < X(T ) unaﬀected. For a prescribed target expected terminal wealth EX(T ) ≥ C, the investor’s aim is to minimize the
above downside risk. On the other hand, the investor expects a return above the
risk free investment consisting of πi = 0 for i = 1, · · · , m, and whose associated
wealth process X(·) satisﬁes dX(t) = rX(t)dt, X(0) = X0 , and has for solution,
X(T ) = X0 erT . This leads to the following natural assumption, C ≥ X0 erT .
The wealth X(·) and portfolio π are called admissible if they satisfy the linear
stochastic diﬀerential equation (3). The mean semi-variance portfolio optimization problem can then be formulated as1
min E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2

π∈IRm

EX(T ) ≥ C,
(X(·), π) is admissible.

subject to

(8)

Problem (8) is called feasible if there exists at least one admissible pair satisfying
EX(T ) ≥ C. Given C, the optimal strategy π
¯ of (8) is called an eﬃcient strategy
and the pair (EX(T ), E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2 ) is called an eﬃcient point.
The set of all eﬃcient points, when the parameter C runs over [X0 erT , +∞),
is called the eﬃcient frontier. We emphasize again that the eﬃcient frontier
depends on the notion of risk under consideration.
After some calculations in Section 3, we will reduce the m-dimensional mean
semi-variance portfolio selection problem (8) to the following one-dimensional
optimization problem, expressed in terms of the normal density function
min X02 e2rT Γ (ε),
ε∈IR

Remark 1. The important fact about this result is that the only unknown in
the expression of the optimal portfolio π
¯ , which could have an arbitrary large
number of assets, is ε¯, which is the solution of the one-dimensional optimization
problem (9). In other words, we have reduce the portfolio selection problem on
m + 1 assets to a one-dimensional problem.
Remark 2. We note that it is not possible to carry out the optimization problem
(9) analytically since Φ(·) is the standard normal distribution function. However,
numerical techniques can be fruitfully used. For this, one can use standard polynomial approximations, such as the one with six-decimal-place accuracy (see [4]),
and use a numerical optimization routine, such as Matlab Optimization Toolbox.

We numerically apply the above algorithm to an example, whose details can
be found in Section 4, to run a comparative valuation of the eﬃcient frontier for
the mean semi-variance case studied here, versus the classical Markowitz style
mean variance portfolio selection. The results are plotted in Figure 1. What is
interesting to note in this ﬁgure, is that to reach the same level of terminal
wealth, a level of risk almost 6 orders of magnitude higher must be taken with
mean variance compared to semi-variance, since the latter leaves the up-side
strategies open.

Proof of the Main Results

We ﬁrst recall a multi-dimensional version of Itˆ
o’s lemma (see, e.g., [14], [10])
Lemma 1 Given an m-dimensional process x(·) satisfying
dx(t) = µ(t, x(t))dt + ν(t, x(t))dW (t),
and a real valued function ϕ(·, ·) ∈ C 2 ([0, T ] × IRm ), we have
dϕ(t, x(t)) = ϕt (t, x(t))dt + ϕx (t, x(t)) dx(t)

(14)

+ 12 tr[ν(t, x(t)) ϕxx (t, x(t))ν(t, x(t))]dt.

Using this lemma and after some calculations, see [8], one can ﬁnd the density
function of the wealth process X(t) in (5) to be

(15)

We now reduce part of the semi-variance’s expression (8) in continuous time.
Using an idea introduced in [5], the starting point is to project the problem onto
the family of ellipsoids,
ε= η = σπ .

(16)

Lemma 2 Given an admissible solution π of problem (8), the semi-variance can
be expressed as
E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2 = X02 g(ε, T )e2(r+(b−r1) π)T ,

Now, substituting (16) in the above yields the desired result.
Note that the function g(ε, T ) is one-dimensional. The exponential part in
(17) has still m-variables. To further reduce dimension, we introduce the following intermediary optimization problem.
Any ﬁxed ε > 0 deﬁnes an ellipsoid. Using Lemma 2 and (6), problem (8),
projected onto this ellipsoid, can be transformed into the following optimization
problem
min X02 g(ε, T )e2(r+(b−r1) π)T ,
π 
 X0 e(r+(b−r1) π)T ≥ C,
subject to
σ π = ε,

π ∈ IRm .

Proposition 1 The optimal solution of problem (18) is given by
π=

ε
(σσ )−1 (b − r1),
θ

(19)

where θ = σ −1 (b − r1) denotes the market price of risk.
Proof. We introduce some transformations. Problem (18) is clearly equivalent
to
min X02 g(ε, T )e2(r+(b−r1) π)T ,
π 
 (b − r1) π ≥ C,
subject to
σ π = ε,

π ∈ IRm ,

(20)

ln XC0 − r. By hypothesis (7), E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2 > 0,
therefore, using Lemma 2, we have, g(ε, T ) > 0. Hence, we can further reduce
problem (20) to

where C =

1
T

min (b − r1) π,
π 
 (b − r1) π ≥ C,
subject to
σ π = ε,

π ∈ IRm .

(21)

We will ﬁnally solve problem (21). Let us introduce the Lagrange multipliers
µ ≥ 0 and λ = 0 of (21)
L(π, µ, λ) = (1 + µ)(b − r1) π − µC − λ( σ π

2

− ε2 ).

A simple square completion calculation, see [8], yields
L(π, µ, λ) = −λ π −

It can be veriﬁed, see the above reference, that this problem has for minimum,
π=

1+µ
2λ (σσ

)−1 (b − r1).

Substituting the solution (22) into σ π = ε, we conclude that
together with (22), implies (19).

(22)
1+µ

Solving (8) amounts to minimizing the solution (19) of (18) over all possible
ε, we can more generally write problem (8) as
min X02 e2rT Γ (ε),

subject to
where Γ (ε) = g(ε, T )e2εθT .

X0 e(r+εθ)T ≥ C,
ε > 0,

(23)

It remains to verify that this problem is convex. Since the objective function X02 e2rT Γ (ε) of (9) is transformed from E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2 via
the linear transformation (19), X02 e2rT Γ (ε) is also convex in ε. Indeed, let
G(π) = E[max(EX(T ) − X(T ), 0)]2 , H(ε) = X02 e2rT Γ (ε). Then G(π) = H(ε)
for π, ε related by (19). For α ∈ (0, 1), εˆ, ε˜ ∈ IR and π
¯, π
˜ ∈ IRm , using the linearity
of (19), we have
αˆ
π + (1 − α)˜
π = [αˆ
ε + (1 − α)˜
ε](σσ )−1 (b − r1).
Then,
G(αˆ
ε+(1−α)˜
ε) = H(αˆ
π +(1−α)˜
π ) ≤ αH(ˆ
π )+(1−α)H(˜
π ) = αG(ˆ
ε)+(1−α)H(˜
ε).
In addition, the set deﬁned in (9) is convex. Therefore, the optimization problem
(9) has a unique minimum solution.

Example

We now consider an example to illustrate the results of the previous section, with
interest rate r = 2% and m = 3 stocks. The time granularity for all parameters
is yearly. The yearly drift, volatility and correlation matrix ρ of the 3 stocks are
listed below,

that is,

t ∈ [0, T ],

i = 1, 2, 3,

(24)

where z(t) := (z1 (t), z2 (t), z3 (t)) are correlated Brownian motions with
dz(t)dz(t) = ρdt. We need the volatility matrix σσ of the standard Brownian
motion for the dynamics of these assets, as in (2). Let ν be the diagonal matrix
with diagonal entries, ν1 , ν2 , ν3 . Comparing the volatility coeﬃcients of (2) and
(24), yields the vector equality, νdz(t) = σdW (t). Multiplying each side by the
transpose, and using the fact that, dz(t)dz(t) = ρdt and dW (t)dW (t) = Idt,
where I is the 3-dimensional identity matrix, results in σσ = νρν. Therefore

θ = σ −1 (b − r1) = 0.2116.
We then numerically solved problem (9) in this case, using Matlab Optimization Toolbox. We discretized time into daily time steps going 5 years forward,
and the optimal ε¯ was accordingly computed at the daily frequency. The results
are plotted in Figure 2. Then substituting every optimal ε¯ into (11) yields the
optimal strategy. Finally, the corresponding eﬃcient frontier was obtained using
(12) and plotted as a surface, in Figure 1, for the interest rate r = 2%, time
horizon up to T = 5 years, initial wealth X0 = 1, 000, 000 and terminal wealth
C ∈ [X0 e0.02T , 2, 000, 000]. On the same Figure, we have also plotted the eﬃcient frontier corresponding to the mean-variance optimal portfolio, see [8] for
more detail. For a ﬁxed T , the cross section of the surface is the eﬃcient frontier.
Note that a higher level of wealth C corresponds to higher semi-variance, which
decreases as T increases, as a larger portion of the wealth can be invested in the
bond.

Conclusion

Portfolio optimization under mean semi-variance is more appropriate than its
classical counter part mean variance, but is however a lot more complicated. In
continuous-time, and for constant parameters, we proposed in this work an approach which compressed or reduced the multi-dimensional problem, as many as
the assets, to a one-dimensional problem, for which one can use numerical routines quite eﬃciently. Extending this work to time dependent parameters adds
considerable complexity to the problem. This is accomplished in [8]. Undertaking

numerical comparisons between various down side risk portfolio optimization approaches would be very valuable for practical applications. We intend to pursue
this elsewhere.
