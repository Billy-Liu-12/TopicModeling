Abstract. Understanding of processes in which calcium signaling is involved is of fundamental importance in systems biology and has many
applications in medicine. In this paper we have studied the particular
case of the complex calcium-calcineurin-MCIP-NFAT signaling network
in cardiac myocytes, the understanding of which is critical for treatment
of pathologic hypertrophy and heart failure. By including some most
recent experimental ﬁndings, we constructed a computational model totally based on biochemical principles. The model can correctly predict
the mutant (MCIP1−/− ) behavior under diﬀerent stress such as PO
(pressure overload) and CaN∗ (activated calcineurin) overexpression.

Introduction

In eukaryotic cells, Ca2+ functions as a ubiquitous intracellular messenger regulating a diverse range of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, muscle contraction, programmed cell death, etc [5,8,12,20]. Recently it has been recognized
that calcium also plays a central role in the control of heart growth through a complex calcium-calcineurin-MCIP-NFAT signaling network (see Fig. 1, please note
that the abbreviations used in this paper are listed in the legends of Fig. 1 and in
the note of Table 1). The heart responds to physiological and pathological stimuli
by hypertrophic growth [20, 21]. Cardiac hypertrophy is a thickening of the heart
muscle (myocardium) resulting in a decrease in size of the ventricles. Prolonged
pathological hypertrophy may progress to heart failure and signiﬁcantly increase
the risk for sudden death. Thus deciphering the details of the signaling pathways
involved in cardiac hypertrophy and understanding their quantitative dynamics
through computational modeling will be critical for devising therapeutic drugs
for the treatment of heart disease [21].
As shown in the left-up corner of Fig.1, stress incurs the rise of the concentration of cytosolic Ca2+ (in normal cardiac myocytes, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
rests at a level of less than 200nM and it becomes more than 700 nM under a
very strong stress condition), which binds to CaM (4:1). Ca2+ -bound CaM binds
to CaN to activate it [13]. CaN∗ (i.e., activated CaN) can bind to MCIP to form
Complex1 [21,22]. CaN∗ can also work as the enzyme to help convert NFATP into
NFAT [11]. Another enzyme GSK3β works in the reverse conversion of NFAT into

NFATP , which can bind to 14-3-3 to form Complex3 [2,10]. Such conversion between NFAT and NFATP with the help of two enzymes (GSK3β and CaN∗ ) also
happens in the nucleus [7]. NFAT in the cytosol will be imported into the nucleus
and NFATP in the nucleus will be exported into the cytosol. The nuclear NFAT
can initiate the transcription of the hypertrophic genes and the gene encoding
MCIP (more precisely, MCIP1, a form of MCIP) [7,23]. Both GSK3β and CaN∗
are shuttled between the nucleus and the cytosol [7, 15]. As shown in the rightup corner of Fig.1, particular stress such as PO can activate BMK1 [19], which
catalyzes the conversion of MCIP into MCIPP [1]. MCIPP can be converted into
MCIPP P by GSK3β . The reverse conversion of MCIPP P into MCIPP is again
catalyzed by CaN∗ [22]. MCIPP P will bind with 14-3-3 to form Complex2 [1].

are as follows: calmodulin (CaM); calcineurin (CaN); activated calcineurin (CaN∗ ); nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT); phosphrylated NFAT(NFATP ); modulatory
calcineurin-interacting protein (MCIP); phosphorylated MCIP on serine 112 (MCIPP );
phosphorylated MCIP on both serine 112 and serine 108 (MCIPP P ); big mitogenactivated protein kinase 1 (BMK1); glycogen synthase 3β (GSK3β); the complex formed
by MCIP and calcineurin(Complex1); the complex formed by MCIPP P and protein
14-3-3 (Complex2); the complex formed by NFATP and protein 14-3-3 (Complex3);
pressure overload (PO); hypertrophic stimuli (stress). The stress of PO is delivered by
transverse aortic constriction (TAC).

MCIP1 seems to facilitate or suppress cardiac CaN signaling depending on the nature of the stress (see Fig. 2a). In the case of CaN∗ transgenic mice, the knock-out
of MCIP1 gene (i.e. MCIP1−/− TG mice) exacerbated the hypertrophic response

to CaN∗ overexpression. Paradoxically, however, cardiac hypertrophy in response
to PO was blunted in normal MCIP1−/− mice [9,21].
In 2006, Shin et al. [18] published a paper in FEBS Letters using switching feedback mechanism to explain this dual role of MCIP in cardiac hypertrophy. The aim
of this paper is to propose a much-extended version of Shin’s model by including more recent experimental ﬁndings (e.g., CaN∗ is imported into the nucleus to
function there [7], MCIPP P will associate with protein 14-3-3 [1] and protein 143-3 competes with CaN∗ to associate with NFATP to form Complex3 [10]). The
construction of the model is based on biochemical principles and we use an open
source software (CelleratorT M ) to automatically generate the equations. As we
will see later, this model can correctly predict the mutant (MCIP1−/− ) behavior
under diﬀerent stress such as PO and CaN∗ overexpression.

Computational Model
Cellerator Software

CelleratorT M is a Mathematica package designed to facilitate biological modeling via automated equation generation [16, 24]. It uses an arrow-based reaction
notation to represent biochemical networks and is especially amenable for simulating signal transduction networks.
2.2

Representation of Relevant Reactions

The complex Ca2+ -calcineurin signaling network shown in Fig.1 can be represented using 17 reactions grouped into four categories (see Table 1) in addition
to a transcription control process of MCIP by NFAT.
2.3

The Equations of the Model

The ODEs (ordinary diﬀerential equations) notation of the set of all relevant reactions consists of 28 equations concerning 28 unknowns including Ca(t) which
denotes the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration. Since calcineurin is unique in its speciﬁc responsiveness to sustained, low frequency calcium signals [20], we will assume cytosolic Ca2+ concentration as a constant in the following simulations
as Shin et al. [18] did in their simulations. Then we need to further consider
modeling the transcription control process of MCIP by NFAT. We have added
the following equation to replace the equation of Ca(t) in our model:
M RN A (t) = k41 · N F AT n(t) − k42 · M RN A(t)

(1)

where M RN A(t) denotes the mRNA concentration of MCIP and k41 is the control constant, k42 is the degradation constant [28]. Moreover, we need to add an
additional production term (k43∗M RN A(t)) and a degradation term((ln2/t1/2 )∗
M CIP (t)) in the change rate equation of M CIP (t) where t1/2 denotes the halflife time constant of MCIP. Thus eventually we have completed building of our

Results and Discussion

Now we have the model, then a natural ensuing question is how to simulate the
stress. Similar as Shin et al. did in their paper, we simulate the mild stress (i.e.,
PO) by setting parameter Ca to a smaller constant (0.2μM) (please note that
we use a selected steady state as the initial condition for simulating the normally
growing heart cells for parameter Ca = 0.05μM . This means that we simulate
the increase of the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration incurred by PO by increasing
parameter Ca from 0.05μM to 0.2μM). Moreover, at the same time we increase
the initial value of BM K1(t) from 0.012μM to 1.2 μM because PO activates
BMK1 [19]. The strong stress (i.e., CaN∗ overexpression) is simulated by setting
parameter Ca to a bigger constant (0.4μM) and simultaneously increasing the
initial value of CaN c∗ (t) from 0.0275μM to 0.825μM.

(a) The stimuli of pressure overload (PO) caused more severe hypertrophy in normal
animals (the ﬁrst bar) than in MCIP−/− animals (the second bar) whereas the stimuli of
CaN∗ overexpression (expressed from a muscle-speciﬁc transgene) incurred much more
HW/BW (heart weight normalized to body weight) increase in MCIP−/− transgenic
(TG) mice (the fourth bar) than in normal transgenic mice (the third bar). (b) The

3.1

Steady-State Properties

By numerically solving the equations using the parameters listed in Table 2,
simulations show that the system does evolve to a steady state. In Fig. 2b,
the steady-state value increase of nuclear NFAT (i.e.,N F AT n∗ (t)) under the
diﬀerent stimuli for simulated MCIP+/+ and MCIP−/− heart cells are shown.
By comparison of the ﬁrst two bars in this Figure, we can see that PO causes
greater increase of the steady-state value of nuclear NFAT in simulated normal
cells than in simulated MCIP mutant cells. However, the comparison of the
third bar with the fourth bar tells us that CaN∗ overexpression incurs much less
increase of the steady state value of nuclear NFAT in simulated normal cells
than in simulated MCIP−/− cells.
3.2

Transients and Mutant Behavior

In Fig. 3, critical transient curves in the case of CaN∗ overexpression for simulated MCIP+/+ cells are shown. From Fig. 3d, we can see that the concentration

of nuclear NFAT quickly rises to a peak value of 7.6 nM and then gradually
declines (it will eventually rests at 5.3 nM). Similarly, we can perform numerical
simulations for the MCIP−/− animals. Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d show the transient
curves of the main CaN species and NFAT species under the stimulus of CaN∗
overexpression. From Fig. 2d, we can see that nuclear NFAT steadily increases
from 0.5nM to a resting level of 8.8 nM.
3.3

Discussion

The decrease of Complex2 shown in Fig. 3C means the accelerated dissociation of Complex2 which should produce more MCIPP P (see Reaction 8 in Table
1). However, from Fig. 3b, we can see that MCIPP P is actually decreasing.
Since only two reactions (Reaction 8 and 13) can possibly cause the decrease
of MCIPP P , the only feasible explanation is that the initial sudden rise of cytosolic CaN∗ catalyzes the conversion of MCIPP P to MCIPP and then to MCIP
and the resultant depletion of MCIPP P promotes the dissociation of Complex2
which also causes the concentration rise of protein 14-3-3 as seen in Fig. 3c. The

Simulating Complex Calcium-Calcineurin Signaling Network

117

increasing formation of Complex1 shown in Fig. 3c indicates that the MCIP
converted from MCIPP and the newly expressed MCIP associate with cytosolic CaN∗ . Since in ﬁrst 50 hours, the total increase of Complex1 concentration
(about 0.5 μM) is much greater than the total decrease (less than 0.09 μM) of
the concentration of three MCIP species shown in Fig.3b, we can conclude that
the greatest source of MCIP consumed in the process of increasing formation of
Complex1 is from newly expressed MCIP. The increasing formation of Complex1
also consumes cytosolic CaN∗ and realizes the inhibition of MCIP on calcineurin
(CaN) activity. In simulated MCIP−/− cells, due to the lack of MCIP, nuclear
NFAT increases to a much higher level (8.8nM) than in MCIP+/+ cells (5.3 nM)
as shown in Fig.2d. Also it takes much less time for the system to evolve to new
steady state.
Similarly, the simulations in the case of PO stress (results not shown here due
to the limit of space) show that in normal cells, activated BMK1 promotes the
conversion of MCIP to MCIPP then to MCIPP P which causes the increase of
Comlex2 formation (from 0.28 μM to 0.96 μM) and the decrease of free 14-3-3
concentration (from 0.71 μM to 0.048 μM). In simulated MCIP−/− cells, due to
the existence of large quantity of free 14-3-3, nuclear NFAT increases from 0.5
nM to a less higher level (5.6 nM) than in MCIP+/+ cells (7.2 nM) as shown in
Fig.2b.
By comparison of the experimental and simulated hypertrophic response to
diﬀerent stress shown in Fig. 2a and Fig.2b, we can see both two second bars
are lower than the corresponding ﬁrst bars which means that our model does
reproduce the seemingly facilitating function of MCIP on hypertrophic response
under the stimuli of PO. Moreover, The two fourth bars are higher than the
corresponding third bars which means that our model does reproduce the inhibitory function of MCIP on hypertrophic response under the stimuli of CaN∗
overexpression.

Conclusion

We have built a computational model for the complex calcium-calcineurinMCIP-NFAT signaling network in cardiac myocytes. Our model can correctly
predict the mutant (MCIP1−/− ) behavior under diﬀerent stress such as PO and
CaN∗ overexpression. Our simulation results suggest that in the case of PO, the
seeming facilitating role of MCIP is due to that activated BMK1 promotes the
conversion of MCIP to MCIPP then to MCIPP P which associates with 14-3-3
to relieve the inhibitory eﬀect of 14-3-3 on hypertrophic response. In the case
of CaN∗ TG mice, the overexpressed CaN∗ causes the dissociation of Complex2
by promoting the conversion of MCIPP P to MCIPP then to MCIP, which associates with CaN∗ to inhibit its activity. Moreover, the feedback loop of MCIP
expression controlled by NFAT contributes greatly to this inhibition.
