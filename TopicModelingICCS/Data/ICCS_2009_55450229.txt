Abstract. Taking tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclotrisphosphazene (TPP) as template,
series of derivatives and analogs were designed with the aim to investigate the
structural features of organic zeolite (OZ) and their potential applications. On the
basis of DFT-PBE0/6-31G** quantum calculation, the results show a tight dependence of the electron donor (E-D) of the entire molecule on that of the side
group and bridge. It was found that extending the side fragment with a phenyl ring
and substituting CH/N, or tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-like group, or the side phenyl
fragments substitution by TTF and its derivatives, preserve the “paddle wheel”
molecular shape, a key factor in the tunnel formation on which is based the organic OZ use of TPP. In comparison with the commonly used organic superconductors, most of the designed molecules with TTF fragments were predicted
to show comparable or better E-D strength.
Keywords: molecular design, DFT, organic zeolite, TPP, TTF.

1 Introduction
The absorption properties of materials are emerging as a forefront issue of present day
research, due to the strategic industrial and environmental applications, such as gas
storage, selective gas recognition, and separation [1]. As a result of their unique features, molecular self-assembled materials and organic zeolites (OZ) [2, 3] seem to
constitute a competing alternative in this field, and are thus still to be explored extensively. Originally studied by Allcock [4], tris(o-phenylenedioxy)cyclotriphosphazene
(TPP, 1a) became a compound of choice to investigate the structural features of OZ
and their potential applications.
Studies focused on the stability of the hexagonal modification compared to compact guest-free monoclinic [5], the investigation of gas storage or aromatic guest insertion by advanced NMR techniques [6], the confinement of I2 molecules by several
crystallization procedures [7], and the insertion of dipolar molecules [8]. From TPP to
some of its derivatives, it has been shown that the available space for absorbates can
be modulated by the choice of the side group, which substitutes the dioxyphenylene in
the former, the key-factor of the tunnel formation being reported to be the rigid “paddle wheel” molecular shape and the requirements of the crystal state [9]. For example,
it was reported that TPP and tris(2,3-dioxynaphthyl)cyclotri-phosphazene, (TNP, 2a)

spontaneously form inclusion adducts with benzene, toluene, heptane, octanes, and
many other compounds [4, 10, 11]. With 1a and some of its derivatives, clathration
was characterized as a pure mechanical phenomenon [12]. Some of its relevant applications however, may be based on physico-chemical properties. Within TPP zeolite,
which shows a strong affinity to include gaseous CH4, CO2 [6b], I2 and Xe [6a, 7, 13],
specific host-guest interactions of the donor-acceptor type are expected for channels.
Recent report by Hertzsch T. has shown that 1a may be used to remove radioactive
I2 [6b], even from a humid environment or water [14]. The stability of the inclusion
compound TPP(I2)0.75 up to 420 K [7], was interpreted based on the Lewis acidity of
I2 and the electron-donor (E-D) capacity of the TPP-phenylenedioxy rings. It appears
clear that the E-D capacity may play a certain role in the trapping process of some
compounds within TPP OZ, which may provide some potential applications in the
environmental chemistry. From this viewpoint, different TPP-like materials (Fig. 1)
are studied in this contribution. We focused our interest on the relationship between
the E-D capacity of the side fragment (part C), bridge (part B), and that for the entire
molecule. Although a number of theoretical works on phosphazene containing systems can be found in the literature [15, 16], very few were devoted to related OZ and
the relationship between E-D and the structure of molecules [16]. This contribution
may provide some helpful insights toward the understanding of TPP-like OZ uses and
the further design as well.

2 Computational Strategy
Taking TPP or TNP molecular structure as template, we have designed series of TPP
or TNP analogs by systematically extending or substituting the side fragment with a
phenyl ring and substituting CH/N, or tetrathiafulvalene (TTF)-like group, or the
bridge O substituted by NH totally or partially as described in Fig. 1. All molecular
geometry optimizations were carried out with the aid of Gaussian 03 package [17].
During the geometry optimization, the neutral species were constrained within the C3
symmetry. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation using the PBE0 functional
[18] with the 6-31G(d,p) [19] basis set was performed in the geometry optimization,
which was proved to be proper for such kind of system [16a]. The equilibrium structures were located using analytical energy derivatives. To confirm the structure is a
minimum on the potential energy surface at this level of theory, frequency calculations were performed. The unrestricted formalism was used for the oxidized forms
and uniformly estimated from PBE0/6-31+G (d, p) calculation including diffuse functions needed to describe the cations. From the calculated <S2> values, the spin contamination included in the present calculation results was confirmed to be in general
no more than 3%. IP of the molecules were calculated as described in the equation
below:
IP = -EHOMO.

Where EHOMO is the HOMO energy (according to the Koopman`s theorem [20])
at the HF/6-31G(d,p) level. Our preliminary calculations have proved that based
on Koopman`s theory, the HF/6-311+G* can yield an excellent accuracy for adiabatic
IP [16].

3 Results and Discussion
It is found that the geometry of the core ring is independent of the variation of bridge
atom and/or side fragment. All the structures of investigated compounds preserve the
“paddle wheel” molecular shape (as schematically shown in Fig. 2 as examples), a
key factor in the tunnel formation on which is based the organic OZ use of TPP as
soft material. In general, a good agreement was found between the calculated structures and available crystal data [5, 12a]. The frontier molecular orbital (FMO) distribution of investigated compounds all localized on their three spirocyclic side groups,
as shown in Fig. 3. The E-D strength of the phenyl ring within TPP affects the stability of the adsorbent···adsorbate complex [7]. Therefore, we demonstrated herein a
tight relation between the IP of TPP–like molecules and that of the free side fragment.
Then, one may directly estimates the effect of the substitution on the bridge; the
CH/N heterosubstitution on the side fragment; the extending of side group by extra
phenyl ring or TTF-like fragment; and the substitution of phenyl by TTF-like fragments for the E-D capacity of TTP and its analogs from the IP of the entire molecules.
The obtained electronic properties such as the IP, FMO energies, and energy gaps

between HOMOs and LUMOs are summarized in Table 1. Furthermore, the optimized structures for the neutral and cationic species for investigated compounds only
revealed small structural changes, suggesting being the good candidates for OZ use.

3.1 The Effect of Enhanced π Conjugation and the Bridge O/NH Partially or
Totally Substitution
We begin our discussion with the already synthesized compounds (1a-3a) and 4a
which correspond to extending the phenylenedioxyl side group (within TPP) with one
more phenyl rings, linearly (2a) or laterally (3a, 4a). Some of the corresponding optimized structures are displayed in Fig. 2. In agreement with experimental observations
is the planarity of the side fragment in the cases of 1a, 2a, and of course, the twisted
heterocycle (containing the two O atoms) in 3a. With the aim of evaluating the influence of CH/N heterosubstitution on the molecular structure of TPP and TPP-like
molecules, compounds 1a and 2a were considered for this issue.
As clearly summarized in Fig. 4, the results suggest that (i) the O/NH substitution
increases both the EHOMO and ELUMO energies in the sequence Na < Nb < Nc (with N =
1, 2, and 3) and (ii) π-conjugation increases the EHOMO, while decreasing the ELUMO in
the sequence of 1i < 2i < 3i (i = a, b, and c). From these results, it may be concluded

233

that comparatively to 1a, extending the side group with an aromatic ring destabilizes
the HOMO, which becomes more stabilized by the O/NH substitution. A comparison
of 2i to 3i (or 4a) shows that the HOMO is even more destabilized by a lateral extension. E-D capacity is then increased within the same order as confirmed by IP calculations whose results are summarized in Table 1. The results show a tight dependence
of the E-D capacity of the TPP-like molecules on that of the free side group, resulting
in some interesting implications for some aspects of OZ use: (i) The stability of the
inclusion compound, TPP(I2)x, and the operating temperatures may be improved by
using 1c, 2a, and 3a whose clathrates with many other molecules are already known,
with the OZ-I2 inclusion compound based on 2a being expected to be less stable than
that based on 3a. (ii) The E-D capacity of TPP side groups appears to be tunable,
allowing predictions to be made about the stability of the inclusion compounds of OZ
and molecules of Lewis acidity comparable to that of I2.

LUMOs, H = HOMOs)

3.2 The CH/N Heterosubstitution Effect on the Side Fragment
With the aim to evaluate the influence of the CH/N hetero-substitution on the molecular structure of TPP and TPP-like molecules, compounds 1a, 2a and their CH/N substituted derivatives (1ad-e, 2ad-e) were considered for this issue. From the length of
the side fragment viewpoint, on which depends the available space for adsorbates, we
anticipate a decreasing diameter of the tunnel with the degree of CH/N substitution
within both TPP and TNP.
This can be explained by comparing the C-C bond length of the unsubstituted bond
(1.37-1.41 Å) to that of the corresponding C-N one (1.28-1.30 Å) in the CH/Nsubstituted derivatives. On the basis of our results the magnitude of the variation is
expected in the decreasing order unsubsituted > disustituted derivatives. Thus, the size
of the adsorbing space in CH/N derivatives of TPP may be anticipated to be smaller
than that of TPP itself, while CH/N derivatives of TNP would lead to crystals having
a tunnel spacein between those with TPP and TNP.

The CH/N substitution in the side fragment decreases (and stabilizes) the HOMO
and LUMO eigenvalues at the same time owing to the presence of two nitrogen atoms
and very dependently on the position of the substituted CH group in the side fragment. Due to the inductive effect of the nitrogen atom, the HOMO gets stabilized in
the sequence 1a < 1ae < 1ad within the subgroup of TPP and its CH/N derivatives and
in the sequence of 2a < 2ad < 2ae in the subclass of TNP and its CH/N derivatives.
The predicted net effect was that, in comparison to TPP, extending the side group
with an aromatic ring (TNP) destabilizes the HOMO, which becomes more stabilized
by CH/N substitution.

3.3 The Effects of TTF-Like Fragments in the Side Groups
To design novel materials combining a good E-D strength and “paddle wheel” molecular shape responsible for inclusion adducts formation, we introduce TTF-like
fragments in to TPP by fused with phenyl ring (5) or substituting it (6), which may
lead to potential candidates for superconductors, that may combine a good electrondonor ability and a possible inclusion adduct formation. The bridging parts by O/NH
substitution are also considered.
In general, most of the new derivatives are predicted to preserve the “paddle
wheel” molecular shape, the TTF-containing side group retaining the TTF-like
donor behavior (TTF-like moiety distortion into the planar) during the oxidization
process. From the electron-donor ability point of view, the current study shows
clearly that, comparatively to the commonly used electron donors, such as TTF,
Tetramethyltetraselenafulvalene (TMTSF), Bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene
(ET), Bis(ethylenedioxy)tetrathiafulvalene (BETS-TTF), and Bisethylenedioxytetrathiafulvalene) (BO), whose predicted IPKT ranges from 6.65-7.05 eV, a
comparable E-D ability can be reached by adopting the building approach developed in this work (whose predicted IPKT ranges from 6.69-7.18 eV). An additional
insight provided by the current results is that the O/NH substitution induces a relatively significant decrease in the IP, increasing therefore the E-D strength. Finally,
one may find from the same results that partial substitution leads to TTF-containing
TPP analogs whose IP values (E-D strength) may be in between those of the corresponding derivatives from the total O/NH.

4 Conclusion
Using TPP as template, series derivatives or analogs were designed by chemical
modification of TPP by the substitution of bridge part or side fragments. On the basis
of DFT-BPE0/6-31G** quantum calculation, the results show a tight dependence of
the E-D of the entire molecule on that of the side groups and bridge part, which may
result in some interesting implications for some aspects of OZ use, i.e., (i) The stability of the inclusion compound, OZ-I2, and the operating temperatures may be improved by using high E-D material (ii) The E-D capacity of TPP side groups appears
to be tunable, allowing predictions to be made about the stability of the inclusion
compounds of OZ and molecules of Lewis acidity comparable to that of I2. It was
concluded that the total O/NH substitution for the bridge part may significantly enhance the electron-donor capacity without altering the tolerance of TPP-like host
materials to the guest molecules. The E-D capacity was found to be more significantly
enhanced by a lateral than a linear extension with phenyl ring, while it decreased upon
CH/N heterosubstitution, which can affect the stability of some related host·····guest
complexes in the same order. The extension (or substitution) of the phenylenedioxyl
group with an aromatic ring especially by introducing TTF fragments significantly
enhance the E-D. In addition, in comparison with the commonly used organic superconductors, most of the designed molecules with TTF fragments were predicted to
show comparable or better E-D strength, suggesting them to be good candidates for
organic superconductors.
