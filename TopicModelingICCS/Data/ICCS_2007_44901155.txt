Abstract. Recently atomic cluster structures have been intensively studied
because of their importance in physics, chemistry and material science.
However, finding the lowest energy structure, which is the most stable
configuration, is NP-hard. Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm is a new
heuristic approach which mainly has three advantages: finding the true global
minimum regardless of the initial parameter values, fast convergence, and using
few control parameters. In this paper we describe a new search method that uses
differential evolution (DE) algorithm to optimize the geometry of small argon
atom clusters. Experimental results show that the exact global optimal
configuration of argon clusters with atom number N≤ 16 can be found in a
reasonable computing time, and approximate optimization can also be obtained
for clusters with N=30. From their 3-D geometry structures, we can see that
their optimal energy structures are highly symmetrical.

1 Introduction
Recently atomic cluster structures have been intensively studied because of their
importance in physics, chemistry and material science. One method of solving this
optimization problem is to explore the potential energy surface (PES) composed of all
possible cluster conformations. Unfortunately, as the cluster size increases, so does
the number of degrees of freedom in the placement of the atoms. This characteristic
produces a PES where the number of local optima grows exponentially with the
cluster size [1]. Determining the ground-state energy level, which is the most
energetically stable level, is extremely difficult. Wille and Vennik [2] proved this
problem is NP-hard for homo-nuclear clusters (i.e., clusters with only one type of
atom) and Greenwood [3] later proved the same thing for hetero-nuclear clusters.
Hence, heuristic search techniques are widely used in this area, such as Genetic
algorithms [4,5], Simulated Annealing [6].
Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm [7,8] is a new heuristic approach which
mainly has three advantages: finding the true global minimum regardless of the initial
parameter values, fast convergence, and using few control parameters. In this paper

we describe a new search method that uses differential evolution (DE) algorithm to
optimize the geometry of small argon atom clusters. Experimental results show that
the exact global optimal configuration of argon clusters with atom number N≤ 16 can
be found in a reasonable computing time, and approximate optimization can also be
obtained for clusters with N=30.
The paper is organized as follows. An overview of atomic clusters is provided in
Section 2. Section 3 reviews the DE approach and shows how it is used to search for
low energy conformations. Section 4 presents some experiments conducted with small
clusters of argon atoms. Finally, Section5 concludes the paper with summary and
future research directions.

2 Homo-nuclear Clusters and Potential Energy Functions
The objective is to find the lowest energy conformation because it is the most stable
conformation. In this work, we approximate the total energy as the sum of all the
pairwise interactions between atoms:
N −1

E=∑

N

∑ v(r )

(1)

ij

i =1 j = i +1

Where rij is the Euclidean distance between atoms i and j , and v(rij ) is the
pairwise potential energy function.
A commonly used pairwise potential energy function for (1) is the Lennard-Jones
potential function [4]:
⎡⎛ σ
v ( rij ) = 4.0ε ⎢ ⎜
⎢ ⎜⎝ rij
⎣

12

⎞
⎛σ ⎞
⎟⎟ − ⎜⎜ ⎟⎟
⎠
⎝ rij ⎠

⎤
⎥
⎥
⎦

rij = ( xi − xj ) 2 + ( yi − yj ) 2 + ( zi − zj ) 2

(3)

where ε = 1 , σ = 3.36 Å, xi , yi , zi ∈ [−1/ 2 ⋅ 3 6 N ⋅ σ ,1/ 2 ⋅ 3 6 N ⋅ σ ] .

3 Using DE in Cluster Searches
The DE algorithm is a population based algorithm like genetic algorithms using the
similar operators: crossover, mutation and selection [7]. The main difference in
constructing better solutions is that genetic algorithms rely on crossover while DE
relies on mutation operation. This main operation is based on the differences of
randomly sampled pairs of solutions in the population.
The algorithm uses mutation operation as a search mechanism and selection operation to direct the search toward the prospective regions in the search space. The DE
algorithm also uses a non-uniform crossover that can take child vector parameters
from one parent more often than it does from others. By using the components of the
existing population members to construct trial vectors, the recombination (crossover)
operator efficiently uses information about successful combinations, enabling the
search for a better solution space.

An optimization task consisting of D parameters can be represented by a
D-dimensional vector. In DE, a population of NP solution vectors is randomly created
at the start. This population is successfully improved by applying mutation, crossover
and selection operators. The details of the mutation, crossover and selection operators
were described in literature [7].

4 Experimental Results
These experiments were all executed under Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with
3.00GHz of Intel(R) Pentium(R) 4 CPU and 512 MB of RAM. Each experiment was
executed 10 times, and the parameters of the DE algorithm [7] in the experiments
were as follows:
Dimensions D = 3N, where N is argon atom number, the number of population
NP = 30, the scale factor F = 0.35, the crossover rate CR = 0.2, the maximum
generation is 100000, and we use the strategy DE/rand-to-best/1/exp.
The optimized energy results for argon atom clusters are shown in Table 1. Experimental results show that the exact global optimal configuration of argon clusters with
atom number N≤ 16 can be found in a reasonable computing time, and approximate
optimization can also be obtained for clusters with N=30.
The optimized geometry structures for argon atom clusters (N= 12, 14, 16 and 30)
are shown in Fig. 1. From the pictures, we can see that their geometry structures are
highly symmetrical.

5 Summaries and Future Work
In this paper we use differential evolution algorithm to find global minimum energy
structure of small argon clusters. Experimental results show that the exact global
optimal configuration of argon clusters with atom number N≤ 16 can be found in a
reasonable computing time, and approximate optimization can also be obtained for
clusters with N=30. From their 3-D geometry structures, we can see that their optimal
energy structures are highly symmetrical.
For future work, we will use the proposed DE method in other optimization areas,
such as Si atomic clusters and protein 3-D structure prediction.
