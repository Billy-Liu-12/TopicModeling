Abstract. The mobile market is becoming more competitive. Mobile operators
having been focusing on the market share of high quality customers. In this paper, we propose a new method to help mobile operator to estimate the share in
high quality customers market based on the available data, inter-network calling
detail records. The core of our method is a discretization algorithm which
adopts the Gini criterion as discretization measure and is supervised, global and
static. In order to evaluate the model, we use the real life data come from one
mobile operator in China mainland. The results prove that our method is effective. And also our method is simple and easy to be incorporated into operation
support system to predict periodically.

1 Introduction
Due to deregulation, new technologies, and new competitors, the telecommunication
industry becomes more competitive than ever. Two biggest mobile operators in China
mainland, China Mobile and China Unicom, are struggling for acquiring the customers. As well as attracting the incoming customers, retention of the own high quality
customers and acquisition of competitors’ customers are becoming the core tasks of
each operator. The reason is that these customers are not only the source of the revenue but also the foundation of maintaining an advantage in such a competitive environment. For each operator, the pre-step of retention and acquisition is to estimate the
share in high quality customers market and be control of changes of share. This prework is very important because it can help to duly find the potential problems during
the process of managing the high quality customers and can be guideline to supervise
the operation of sub operators to guarantee that they can be kept in sustaining
developments.
In this paper, we propose a new method to help one China Mobile operator in
China mainland to estimate the share in high quality customers market. Due to the
lack of the foundational data, the estimation can only be based on the inter-network
calling detail records (CDRs) which are stored in the operation support systems
(OSS). The CDRs describe the calling behaviors between the competitors’ customers
and the operators’ internal customers, which are composed of many fields including
calling part, called part, starting time and duration of the call. However, the calling

types, which include local call, long-distance call and roam call, are difficult to identify from the inter-network CDRs. In order to decrease the costs of data process, the
estimation can only depend on the total call duration of each customer.
In the traditional method, the estimation process can be decomposed of three steps.
Firstly, the distribution of inter-network call duration of China Unicom’s customers is
computed. Secondly, a cut point is chosen based on the distribution. Finally, the market share can be estimated by using the scale of the customers whose calling duration
is greater than the chosen cut point. These customers are considered as high quality
ones. The foundational hypothesis of the traditional method is that the customers who
have higher inter-network calling duration are more possible to be high quality customers. Although this method is adopted universally by operators, it has some drawbacks and can result in estimation error.

Due to the difference of the customers’ behavioral structure and the difference
of the prices of telecom services, the hypothesis of the traditional method can’t
be satisfied. For example, for some customers, the long-distance calls and
roam calls occupy bigger proportion in the total duration than others’. Because
the prices of these two services are higher, although they may have shorter total calling duration, they also can be high quality customers.
The China Unicom customers can give call to many customers including not
only China Mobile but also China Telecom and China Netcom ones. However,
the OSS of China Mobile only records the CDRs between China Mobile and
China Unicom. So if some customers have long calling duration, most of
which are not directional to China Mobile, then these customers are possible to
be considered as low quality ones.

The most current research of market share estimation focus on the sales prediction
[1, 2]. The research on customers’ market share estimation in telecom is rare. And
because of the disadvantages of traditional method, we propose a new method which
is a process of inference from China mobile customers to China Unicom customers.
During the process our method adopts supervised discretization technology which has
good characters compared with other ones. We estimate the market share based on the
real life data which come from one China Mobile operator. And the data are customers’ CDRs from January to November in 2007. The results show that our method is
simple and comparatively accurate.

2 Discretization Method
The discretization methods can be classified according to three axes [3]: supervised versus unsupervised, global versus local, and static versus dynamic. A supervised method
would use the classification information during the discretization process, while the
unsupervised method would not depend on class information. The popular supervised
discretization algorithms contain many categories, such as entropy based algorithms including Ent-MDLP [4, 5], D2 [6], Mantaras distance [7], dependence based algorithms
including ChiMerge, Chi2 [8], modified Chi2 [9], Zeta [10], and binning based algorithms including 1R, Marginal Ent. The unsupervised algorithms contain equal width,
equal frequency and some other recently proposed algorithms such as PCA-based algorithm [11] and an algorithm using tree-based density estimation [12].

Local methods produce partitions that are applied to localized regions of the instance space. Global methods, such as binning, produce a mesh over the entire continuous instances space, where each feature is partitioned into regions independent of
the other attributes.
Many discretization methods require a parameter, , indicating the maximum
number of partition intervals in discretizing a feature. Static methods, such as EntMDLP, perform the discretization on each feature and determine the value of n for
each feature independent of the other features. However, the dynamic methods search
through the space of possible n values for all features simultaneously, thereby capturing interdependencies in feature discretization. Most of the popular methods are classified according to the three axes in [13]. The Fig. 1 describes the basic process of
discretization. In our application, we use the Gini-criterion based discretization which
is supervised, global and static.

2.1 Notations
Suppose for a supervised classification task with k class labels, the training data set
consists of | | instances, where each instance belongs to only one of classes. Let
be one continuous attribute. Next, there exists a discretization scheme on the attribute A, which discretizes the attribute into discrete intervals bounded by the pairs
of numbers:

where and , respectively, are the minimal and the maximal values of the attribute
, and the values in are arranged in ascending order. The discretization scheme
is called an -scheme. These values constitute the cut points set
, , ,
of the discretization scheme. The discretization algorithm is to determine the value of
and the cut points set.
2.2 Discretization Measure
For the ith interval
, , we can get a conditional class probability
,
,
where
is the th class probability in th interval and satisfies
∑
1. The Gini [14] is defined as follows:
(1)
In our algorithm we use Gini gain as the discretization measure. The cut point is
chosen based on the criterion, whose Gini gain value is the biggest on attribute . The
Gini gain ∆ is defined as:

, ;

,

(2)

where
· is the Gini measure defined in Eq. (1),
and
are the subsets of
partitioned by the cut point , |·| denotes the number of instances.
2.3 Stopping Criterion
The training set is split into two subsets by the cut point which is chosen using Gini
measure. Subsequent cut points are selected by recursively applying the same binary
discretization method to one of the generated subsets, which has biggest Gini gain
value, until the stopping criterion is achieved. Because the quality of discretization
methods involves a tradeoff between simplicity and predictive accuracy, the stopping
criterion of our algorithm is defined by
,

the user, is the Gini value with intervals, defined by

Eq. (3) can be easily returned as follows:

X. Zhang et al.

From the Eq. (5), we can know that the parameter can affect the number of partition intervals. The smaller the right part of the Eq. (5) is, the more chances the algorithm has to discretize the continuous attribute further. In general, higher value can
result in more intervals.
2.4 Comparison with Other Discretization Measures
The following are two other discretization measures.
∑

Entropy measure:

(6)
,

Minimal measure:

,

,

(7)

These two measures and Gini measure have common characters. Their values are
high for lower probable events and low otherwise. Hence, they are the highest when
1/ for each j; and they are the lowest when
each event is equi-probable, i.e.,
1 for one event and 0 for all other events. As known, entropy is one of the most
commonly used discretization measures in the discretization literature. When there are
only two classes in a classification task, entropy undoubtedly is an excellent measure
of class homogeneity. However, when there are more than two classes in a classification problem, entropy sometimes cannot accurately reflect the class homogeneity. For
example, see the Table 1.

In the example, the entropy value for case 1 is the lowest. Because the smaller
value is preferred, the case 1 is the best of all. But the case 3 has higher prediction
accuracy, it is 3/4 higher than 1/2 in case 1. Likewise, the minimal measure has the
same ordered value as entropy. However, Gini measure gives the case 3 the lowest
value. So in this example, Gini measure shows the better ability in terms of classification than the other ones.
We compare the contours of three measures, entropy, Gini, and minimal, in Fig. 2.
The vertex of the triangle denotes the event in which only one class label occurs. The
center
1/3, 1/3, 1/3 denotes that each class label occurs at the equal probability. The farther away the point moves from , the higher the degree of the class
heterogeneity.
The minimal measure only consider the minimum class information in an interval,
whereas the Gini measure takes into account all the class information and evaluates
the interval according to the whole class distribution. The shape of contour of entropy

lies between minimal and Gini. Entropy and minimal measure seem to prefer the
points that are close to the boundary of the triangle. So they prefer (1/2, 1/2, 0) than
(1/8, 3/4, 1/8).

3 Estimation Method
3.1 Notations
All telecom operators pay more attention to average revenue per user (ARPU). The customers with high ARPU mean that they can provide more revenue to operators and they
are the high quality customers. The ARPU depends on the calling minutes per user in
one month (MOU) and the price of services. In our application, the customers which
satisfy the following conditions can be defined as high quality customers in th month.

- The average ARPU of th,
1th,
2th months is greater than 100 Yuan.
- During th,
1th,
2th months, the calling behaviors all exist.
In order to give the basic definitions, the customers’ average MOU of th,
1th,
2th months are sorted by ascending order. Then the MOU values are discretized
into many intervals by cut points. The number of customers and high quality customers
falling into these intervals can be computed. The Fig. 3 shows the process.

quality customers falling into th MOU interval. And
is the number of the China Unicom customers falling into the th MOU interval,
is number of the high quality customers falling into th MOU interval. MOU means the average MOU of the continuous
three months.
3.2 Basic Hypothesis
The basic hypothesis of our method is that in all discretized intervals, proportions of
the high quality customers for two operators are similar, which can be represented by
,

, ,

, ,

.

(8)

The meaning of the hypothesis is concluded in the following.

-

In each MOU interval, the distribution of the proportion between the China
Unicom customers’ inter-network call MOU and their total call duration is
similar to the China Mobiles’ customers.
- For China Mobile and China Unicom customers, the call behavior structure is
similar in each MOU interval.
Because of the similarity of service structure, service quality and service price for
the two operators, the hypothesis can be approximately satisfied. And to some extent,
the hypothesis depends on the chosen cut points which discretize the MOU into intervals. We adopt the Gini discretization method to choose the cut points.
3.3 Estimation
Based on the basic hypothesis, the formula of estimating the number of China Unicom’s high quality customers is as follows:
,

(9)

and
can be computed simply based on internal CDRs and
can be
where
computed based on inter-network CDRs.
In order to estimate the market share of high quality customers for each sub mobile
operators, we also need to estimate the number of high quality customers of each sub
China Unicom operator.

3.4 Model Evaluation
Due to lack of the real market share data, we can’t directly evaluate the model. We
adopted the self-validation method. In other words, we use our method to estimate the
proportion of high quality customers to all customers in China Mobile which can be
compared to the real proportion. We use the data from nth to n+2th months to build
model and estimate the proportion of n+3th month. The process is shown in Fig. 4.

4 Results
In the application, we extract the internal CDRs and inter-network CDRs from January to November in 2007. The cut points obtained by using supervised discretization
technology are shown in Table 2. Here the best number of cut points is seven, so there
are eight discretization intervals. Because of totally eleven months, we can get nine
groups of cut points. In order to get robust results, we adopt the median of all groups
as the final cut points.

The evaluation results are shown in Table 3, in which Ci (i=1, 2, …, 12) represents
the ith sub China Mobile operator. Totally there are twelve sub operators. And because of eleven months, we can obtain eight groups of errors. We can see that the
average error of each sub operator is less than 6%, which proves that our estimation
method can obtain good accuracy. The Table 4 shows the results of market share

that it can be easily incorporated into operation support system to predict periodically.

5 Conclusions
In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the market share of high quality customers for mobile operators. This method is based on a discretization technology which
adopts the Gini criterion as discretization measure. The Gini-based discretization method
is supervised, static and global, which is compared with other methods and has its’ good
characters. We describe the complete process of estimating market share. And based on
real life data come from one China mobile operator, the estimation method is implemented. The results prove that our method is effective. Our method is also simple and
can be easily incorporated into the OSS to predict periodically.
