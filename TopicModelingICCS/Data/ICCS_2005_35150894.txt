Abstract. RNA interference (RNAi) is a posttranscriptional gene silencing mechanism frequently used to study gene functions and knock
down viral genes. RNAi has been regarded as a highly eﬀective means of
gene repression. However, an “oﬀ-target eﬀect” deteriorates its speciﬁcity
and applicability. The complete oﬀ-target eﬀects can only be characterized by examining all factors through systematic investigation of each
gene in a genome. However, this complete investigation is too expensive
to conduct experimentally which motivates a computational study. The
sequence matching between an siRNA and its target mRNA allows for
mismatches, G-U wobbles, and the secondary structure bulges, in addition to exact matches. To simulate these matching features, we propose
string kernels measuring the similarity between two oligonucleotides and
develop novel eﬃcient implementations for RNAi oﬀ-target detection.
We apply the algorithms for oﬀ-target errors in C. elegans and human.

Introduction

In addition to its use as a powerful tool to study gene functions and knockdown
viral genes, RNA interference (RNAi) [1] also has the potential for validating
drug design and treating diseases. RNAi is initiated by short interfering RNA
(siRNA) of about 21 nt in length, either generated from double stranded RNA
(dsRNA) by the enzyme Dicer, or delivered experimentally. Target mRNA transcripts that are matched with the siRNA are destroyed by the silencing complex
RISC. RNAi has been regarded as a highly eﬀective means of gene repression [2].
However, the eﬀectiveness of RNAi can be compromised by the oﬀ-target knockdown, also known as nonspeciﬁc, cross-reactive, and false positive knockdown,
which is deﬁned as gene silencing inadvertently induced when a true target gene
is intended to be knocked down. Characterizing the speciﬁcity of RNAi is critical
to fully applying this novel technology to therapeutics [3, 4].
Examinations of RNAi oﬀ-target eﬀect have yielded mixed results. The predominant opinion is that RNAi is highly speciﬁc to its target [2, 5]. But significant non-speciﬁc gene knockdowns have also been reported [6, 7]. In addition,
some RNAi applications did not evaluate oﬀ-target eﬀects [8]. To thoroughly
understand RNAi speciﬁcity, oﬀ-target eﬀect of silencing each gene should be

evaluated in a genome by considering multiple factors. However, it is expensive
to conduct this comprehensive study experimentally. Computational approach is
inexpensive to implement and able to extend experimental parameters into wider
ranges and simulate what is impossible under normal biological conditions.
If an RNAi experiment assesses its speciﬁcity, the recommended procedure is
using BLAST [9] searches to ﬁnd oﬀ-target genes [10]. The sequence binding between an siRNA and its target mRNA allows for mismatches, G-U wobbles, and
the secondary structure bulges [7]. Though BLAST allows for deletion, insertion
and mismatch based on alignment, it cannot control exact patterns of the imperfect matches, such as their positions and lengths. To simulate siRNA-target
matching, we develop string kernels that accurately generate matching patterns
by controlling the pattern length and position.
Related to RNAi, computational methods exist to predict microRNA genes
and targets [11, 12], putative RNAi [13], and siRNA eﬃcacy [14]. To our knowledge, related works have not studied RNAi speciﬁcity. Our string kernels are the
ﬁrst of their kind to simulate siRNA and target matching that allows for accurate
pattern control. We measure the similarity between two oligonucleotides with inner products in the feature space, similar to [15]. Leslie et al. [15] constructed a
mismatch tree for computing their mismatch string kernel for a support vector
machine classiﬁer to detect protein families. But this mismatch kernel did not
control mismatch positions. Amir et al. [16] developed an algorithm for string
searches with single letter mismatch, which is not enough for RNAi.
We ﬁrst deﬁne oﬀ-target error rate using information retrieval theory. We
then propose novel string kernels to simulate siRNA and its target binding and
develop eﬃcient implementations for genome-wide computation. We study the
dependencies of non-speciﬁcity on factors derived from RNAi experiments including dsRNA length, siRNA length, lengthes and positions of imperfect mismatches. Experiments are performed on C. elegans and human genomes.

String Kernels and Their Implementations

We ﬁrst deﬁne the exact match string kernel and the oﬀ-target error rate. We
then present the imperfect match kernels and their implementations.
Sequence matching between an siRNA from a given gene and another endogenous gene signiﬁes an occurrence of oﬀ-target knockdown, which is a typical
setting for gene function analysis [8]. For viral gene silencing, we conceptually
combine the viral gene into the host genome and use the same setting.
2.1

Matching siRNA and Target with the Exact Match String
Kernel

We describe each gene by its possible contiguous subsequences of length n (17-28
nt), called n-mers, or n-grams, representing siRNAs. Gene gx in the input space
X , consisting of sequences drawn from the alphabet A = {a, c, g, t}, is mapped
n
into an n-gram feature space R4 by the feature map of exact match,
Φex (gx ) = (φa (gx ))a∈An ,

(1)

896

S. Qiu and T. Lane

where φa (gx ) is the number of times n-gram a occurs in gx . Therefore, the image
of gx is the coordinates in the feature space indexed by the number of occurrences
of its constituent n-mers. A gene gy is said to match gx if the following is true,
K(gx , gy ) = Φex (gx ), Φex (gy ) ≥ T,

(2)

for a threshold T . The similarity measure K(gx , gy ) = Φex (gx ), Φex (gy ) in (2)
deﬁnes a kernel as used for a support vector machine classiﬁer [17]. We use the
kernel to match an siRNA and its target, instead of classifying. Since any match
between an siRNA and an mRNA will silence the gene, we choose T = 1.
Implementation of the Exact Match Kernel. Computing the similarity
of (2) directly in a vector space requires O(DF 4n ) time, where F is the number
of n-grams in the genome (40 × 106 for C. elegans and 60 × 106 for human) and
D (close to F ) is the amount of n-mers to be compared in the coding sequences.
For genome-wide scan, this computing time is prohibitive and can be improved
since the the feature vectors are sparse. We use an inverted ﬁle where the n-mers
serve as identiﬁers and their gene names and positions within the genes serve
as attributes. We use the positions for imperfect matches later. If we ignore nmers having zero occurrence and allow for duplicate n-mers, a gene gx can be
represented in the feature space compactly,
Φex (gx ) = {(a1 , p1 ), (a2 , p2 ), ..., (akx , pkx )},

(3)

where aj , 1 ≤ j ≤ kx , is the jth n-gram of gx , pj is its position on gx , and kx is
the number of n-mers in gx . In the inverted ﬁle, the records for gx contains the
triples a1 , gx , p1 , a2 , gx , p2 , a3 , gx , p3 ,..., akx , gx , pkx . The inverted ﬁle for
a genome is the collection of the triples of its genes. To speed up computation,
we sort the inverted ﬁle on the n-mer ﬁeld using a binary search tree (BST).
K(gx , gy ) in (2) is computed by searching each n-mer of gx for gy in the inverted ﬁle. K(gx , gy ) is the number of occurrences of gy among the matched
genes. Each search in the BST takes O(log F ) time, resulting in a time of
O(kx log F ) for computing K(gx , gy ).
2.2

Deﬁnition of Oﬀ-target Error Rate

We deﬁne the oﬀ-target error using the exact match kernel, but it is the same
for other kernels. To simulate Dicer’s cleavage of dsRNA (100-400bp) into siRNAs, we take an oligonucleotide ox , as dsRNA, from gene gx and map it into
the feature space using the exact match kernel. Expressed compactly as in (3),
Φex (ox ) = {(s1 , p1 ), (s2 , p2 )..(slx , plx )}, where sj is the jth n-mer in ox . To obtain the matched genes based on (2), we compute the kernel K(ox , gy ) for each
gene gy , for 1 ≤ y ≤ G, where G is the total number of genes in a genome. These
calculations use BST searches, as described previously.
Let Cx = {gx1 , gx2 , ...} be the set of genes whose kernel values with ox satisﬁes (2), excluding gx itself. The precision of a search is the proportion of correct
documents to the total number of documents matched. Here, only gx is correct and the number of genes returned is 1 + |Cx |. So the precision of gx is Px =

String Kernels of Imperfect Matches for Oﬀ-target Detection in RNAi

897

1/(1+|Cx |). We deﬁne the oﬀ-target error of gx as Ex = 1−Px = |Cx |/(1+|Cx |).
We deﬁne the average error rate as,
E(Θ) =

G
i=1

Ei /G,

(4)

where Ei is the error for silencing gene gi . And Θ = l, n, m, p, b, q, w, r is the
set of parameters, where l is the dsRNA length; n, siRNA length; m, mismatch
length; p, position of the mismatch; b and w are lengths of the bugle and wobble;
and q and r are positions of the bulge and the wobble, respectively. Figure 1
shows some of the parameters. The average number of incorrect genes targeted
by silencing each gene in the genome is, Z(Θ) = E(Θ)/(1 − E(Θ)).

Note the mismatch, bulge and wobble neighborhoods are supersets of the exact match region. By deﬁning the similarity neighborhood for the combination
of mismatches, bulges, and wobbles as the union of the neighborhoods deﬁned
above, we can deﬁne the feature map of simultaneous mismatch, bulge and wobble Φmbw
m,p,b,q,w,r (.) accordingly. The string kernels are derived using inner products
based on the above feature maps, as in (2).

Implementations of Mismatch, Bulge, and Wobble Kernels

Let S = {s1 , s2 ...sN } be a set of strings of length k from an alphabet A. Suppose
string si = a1 a2 ..ak , where aj ∈ A, 1 ≤ j ≤ k, has reverse string si = ak ak−1 ..a1 .
Deﬁnition A mirrored tree of a binary search tree (BST) populated with strings
from S is the BST populated with reverse strings s1 , s2 ,...,sN . A u leading range
of a string s from S searched in a BST is the set of nodes returned by a search
that only matches the beginning u letters of s.

The mismatch kernel in (5) can be computed by the mirrored tree search
(MTS) in Algorithm 1, whose correctness proof we omit due to space limitation.
At step 5 and 6, the substring before the mismatch is exact-matched in T1 and
the leading range is stored in R1 , the substring after the mismatch is exactmatched in T2 and the leading range is stored in R2 . The genes corresponding
to the mismatch letters are sandwiched in C at step 7 by the intersection based
on gene names and positions of the n-mers. At step 9, Ei is computed using Ci .
Let the size of the inverted ﬁle be F and the total number of n-grams from all
dsRNAs be D. MTS has a cost of Tmt = O(D(2 log F + C)), where O(2 log F ) is
the search time in the BSTs, and C is the cost of obtaining the leading ranges and
the intersection. Using proper join algorithms, C can be bounded by O(|R1| +
|R2|) [18]. Empirically, C is small and treated as a constant. The mismatch
tree algorithm [15] has a complexity of O(DLnm 4m ), where L is the average
length of genes. Since usually F < 108 and log F < 30, MTS is much faster. A
straightforward way of mismatch search—done by searching each variant of the
n-mer once—needs 4m exact-match searches in the BST and consumes a time of
Tsf = O(4m DlogF ). MTS’s speedup over the straightforward method is roughly,
Sp ≈ O(4m ). Empirical results demonstrated that MTS achieved speedups of 2
orders of magnitude on average for the 2 organisms. However, it uses more space
because of the mirrored tree.
The wobble kernel can be implemented by modifying Algorithm 1 to allow
only G-U wobbles in step 7. The bulge kernel can also be computed by modifying

MTS. At step 1, use (n + b)-mer on the target; at step 4, elongate si and si to
length n + b by appending b arbitrary letters; get q − 1 leading range R1 from
T1 at step 5; get n + b − q + 1 leading range R2 from T2 at step 6. Thus R1
contains the genes corresponding to the exact matches on the ﬁrst q − 1 letters,
leaving n + b − (q − 1) letters unconstrained in T1 . And R2 contains the genes
corresponding to exact matches on the last n−q+1 letters, leaving b+q−1 letters
unconstrained in T2 . The intersection yields bulge matches of the (n + b)-mer on
the target and n-mer of the siRNA. The combination of imperfect matches can
also be computed using MTS. These implementations are eﬃcient and ﬂexible,
allowing the imperfect match patterns to occur anywhere in the n-grams.

Experiments

The cDNA sequences of 22,168 genes of C. elegans (release WS110) were obtained from Sanger Institute. The human genes representing 27,852 mRNAs
were taken from the RefSeq database at NCBI.
We show oﬀ-target error rates using an exact match in Fig. 2(a)(H. sapiens)
and (b)(C. elegans). When siRNA length increases, the oﬀ-target error decreases.
When an siRNA is short, a small length increase improves the error dramatically
and the error rate curve is steep. But when the siRNA is relatively long, further
length increase only improves the error slightly. The observed siRNA length in
biological experiments is between 19 and 25 nt, which is consistent with our
ﬁnding that increasing siRNA length beyond 25 does not improve speciﬁcity
much. When siRNAs are short, longer dsRNAs generate larger errors. When they
are relatively long, longer dsRNAs cause slight increases in the error. The error
rate in human is higher than in C. elegans, but they present similar patterns.
Therefore we focus on the C. elegans genome in the following. Fig. 2(c) plots
the error rates when bulge, mismatch and wobble exist separately. Bulge barely
increases oﬀ-target error. This is because the larger neighborhood caused by a
bulge is cancelled by the reduced chances of target binding made by an increased
length of the subsequence on the target to form the bulge. Wobble increases the
error slightly, but its increase becomes insigniﬁcant for siRNAs longer than 21

nt. Mismatch caused a dramatic increase in error rate, but its eﬀect diminished
when n ≥ 25. Results also show that positions of these imperfect matches did not
change error rates. Therefore, position eﬀects observed in biological experiments
are due to thermodynamic properties of the sequences and RISC [7]. Fig. 3(a) and

more critical than G-U wobble. Fig. 3(c) displays simultaneous mismatch, bugle,

errors did not diminish until n ≥ 25.

To predict oﬀ-target errors in C. elegans, we ﬁtted a nonlinear regression funcˆ = E(n,

tion (7) using SAS software package, where E
and length parameters are in nucleotides. As shown, n has a negative coeﬃcient,
consistent with oﬀ-target errors decreasing with n. The large coeﬃcient with the
m term shows that mismatch raises the error remarkably. The nonlinear terms
are interactions of n with imperfect match parameters and also have negative
coeﬃcients, demonstrating the dominance of n over other parameters. Given a
range of parameters, predictions using this function provide estimates of the
oﬀ-target error rates and save computational eﬀort.

Conclusions

Because the speciﬁcity of RNA interference is of fundamental importance and
mixed results have been reported, we conducted a computational study of the oﬀtarget eﬀects. To simulate the matching between an siRNA and its target mRNA,
we introduced string kernels of imperfect matches including mismatches, bulges,
and wobbles that are able to control the positions and lengths of the patterns.
To improve computational performance for genome-wide scans, we proposed
eﬃcient implementations for the string kernels, which sped up computation

substantially. Results in C. elegans and human genomes indicated that oﬀ-target
errors were substantial (5% to 80%). We found that bulge did not signiﬁcantly
increase oﬀ-target error, wobble raised the error slightly, and mismatch elevated
the error dramatically. But the increase in error rates all diminished when siRNAs are long enough. Computationally, positions of the imperfect matches did
not change oﬀ-target errors. Therefore, position-eﬀects are due to thermodynamic properties of the components. A nonlinear regression function was ﬁtted
to predict oﬀ-target error rates. In summary, the oﬀ-target eﬀect presents a real
but not prohibitive issue and should be controlled in RNAi experiments.
