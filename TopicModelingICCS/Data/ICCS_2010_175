Abstract
The multiscale multilevel mimetic (M3 ) method was designed in [13] for the accurate modeling of two-phase ﬂows
in highly heterogeneous porous media on general polygonal meshes. In this article, it is extended to well-driven ﬂows
in porous media. We demonstrate its ability to treat accurately non-orthogonal locally-reﬁned meshes and tensorial
material properties.

1. Introduction
We consider a system of equations governing ﬂow of two immiscible phases, oil and water, in a heterogeneous
medium Ω [4]:
∂S
+ div ( f (S ) u) = qw ,
φ
∂t
(1)
u = −λ(S ) K ∇p,
div (u)

= qo + qw ,

where S is the water saturation, u is the bulk velocity, p is the reservoir pressure, and qw , qo are the source/sink terms.
The Buckley-Leverett fractional ﬂow function f (S ) and the total mobility λ(S ) are smooth functions of the saturation.
One of the major diﬃculties in modeling subsurface ﬂows comes from highly variable permeability ﬁelds K with long
correlation lengths. Here, we neglect eﬀects of compressibility and capillary pressure, and assume that the porosity φ
is constant. Finally, we assume that the ﬂuid ﬂow is driven by wells.
Numerical solution of the coupled system (1) requires accurate and eﬃcient methods for solving the elliptic
equation with highly discontinuous coeﬃcient K. Various pressure solvers have been developed over the last two
decades. Most eﬀective solvers exploit ideas of two-level and domain decomposition methods and diﬀer by selection

of interpolation and restriction operators as well as by construction of the coarse grid problem [7, 3, 5, 8]. An
interesting two-level method based on the mortar technique is proposed in [1].
A truly multilevel technique for two-phase ﬂows has been introduced in [13] and was inspired by article [16]
which demonstrated that accuracy comparable to a two-level method [7] could be obtained more eﬃciently. The
multiscale multilevel mimetic (M3 ) method [13] uses the synergy of two ideas: exact algebraic coarsening [10] and
approximate (but accurate) ﬂux coarsening, to generate a multilevel hierarchy of models. Together, they preserve
algebraic structure of the pressure equation on all levels of the multilevel hierarchy. Moreover, independently of the
approximate ﬂux coarsening, we ensure local mass conservation on all levels of the multilevel hierarchy.
The M3 method supports unstructured polygonal meshes, full tensor permeabilities, and arbitrary coarsening
strategies. The latter may result in elements with non-planar edges. In [14], the M3 method was used to analyze
the inﬁltration of water into a two-dimensional layered medium with highly anisotropic inclusions. Time and space
adaptive strategies developed in [15] increase eﬃciency and accuracy of these M3 simulations.
In this article, we extend the M3 method to well-driven ﬂows. Accurate modeling of well singularities is an
important factor in predictive capabilities of reservoir simulations. We use locally reﬁned meshes to capture essential
near-well heterogeneity and the Peaceman model [17] to avoid extremely small times step in the IMPES (IMplicit
Pressure and Explicit Saturation) method. The Peaceman model results in positive reaction terms in pressure equation
which cannot be treated with the original M3 method. To ﬁx this problem, we incorporate new technology [10]
developed for diﬀusion problems with mixed cells.
Results of numerical simulations are presented for a strongly heterogeneous tensorial ﬁeld. We show that the
multiscale solution remains within 5% of the ﬁne-scale solution, even when the computational cost of the pressure
solver is reduced 20 times.
The paper outline is as follows. In Section 2, we describe the Peaceman model and discuss various mesh techniques for reduction of computational complexity. In Section 3, we describe the multilevel multiscale mimetic method.
Comparison of ﬁne-scale and multiscale solutions is presented in Section 4.
2. Peaceman model and computational meshes
Modeling of well singularities is one of the important factors in improving predictions of reservoir simulations. We
combine two approaches: mesh adaptation and the Peaceman model [17]. Using a hierarchical mesh reﬁnement (see,
e.g., Fig. 1) around a well may resolve its inﬂuence to the desired accuracy using only a few additional mesh cells.
A pitfall of this approach is a smaller time step in explicit time integration methods. The semi-analytical Peaceman
model for the well production (or injection) is very accurate when the media around the well is homogeneous. A
pitfall of this model is a loss of accuracy for heterogeneous media. The large pressure gradient ﬂow around the well
accentuates eﬀects of near-well heterogeneities and ﬂow based numerical models are required. A balance between
these two strategies is to use a smaller number of reﬁnement levels to capture essential heterogeneous structures
together with the Peaceman model. Also, this strategy allows the well to be placed anywhere in the original coarse
cell.
Consider a quadrilateral cell E with a scalar permeability KE and a wellbore of radius rw in its geometric center.
Let |E| be the area of E.√ We assume that the cell E is close to a square cell and rw is still much less than the
characteristic size Δx = |E|; therefore, the classical Peaceman model is still applicable. A ﬂow rate uE,w is deﬁned
as the weighted diﬀerence between a wellbore pressure pE,w and numerical pressure pE :
uE,w = λ T E,w (pE,w − pE ),

T E,w =

2π KE h
,
ln(r0 /rw )

(2)

where h is the formation thickness (h = 1m), and r0 is the equivalent radius, the distance from the wellbore at which
the analytical pressure is equal to the average pressure in E. We use the Peaceman calculation [17] and set r0 = 0.2Δx.
We consider mesh reﬁnement around wells on a distorted mesh (see Fig. 1) to illustrate the ability of the M3
method to handle unstructured distorted meshes with degenerate cells. For technical reasons, the computational mesh
was built by coarsening of a 256 × 256 quadrilateral mesh and upscaling of the permeability ﬁeld in coarse cells.
Still, we shall refer to this mesh as the AMR mesh. The upscaling procedure described in Sec.4 produces tensor
permeability coeﬃcients. Ability to handle tensorial materials is another feature of the M3 method highlighted in

this work. The mesh coarsening was based on the distance from the wells. Adaptive mesh coarsening strategies are
studied in the coming paper [15].
3. M3 method
We use the IMPES (IMplicit Pressure and Explicit Saturation) time integration method to solve the coupled equations (1). On each time step, the pressure equation is solved ﬁrst, followed by explicit integration of the hyperbolic
saturation equation. We use the Mimetic Finite Diﬀerence (MFD) method to discretize the elliptic equation and the
multilevel multiscale mimetic (M3 ) method to solve it eﬃciently. The hyperbolic saturation equation is discretized
with the single-point upwind ﬁnite volume method [12].
3.1. Mimetic discretization for ﬂow
Let Ωh be a conformal partition of Ω into polygonal cells E. Let f denote a mesh edge and | f | be its length. The
MFD method discretizes the ﬂow equations independently in each cell E.
The MFD method uses two types of pressure unknowns: cell-based (one unknown per cell, pE ) and edge-based
(one unknown per edge, p f ). The discrete velocity unknowns are only edge-based, u f , and represent average ﬂuxes.
We assume that the ﬂuxes are calculated using normals ﬁxed once and for all. Let PE and UE be the vectors of
edge-based pressure and velocity unknowns, respectively, in cell E. Then, the discrete equations have a saddle-point
form:
ME UE + BTE pE − CTE PE = 0,
(3)
= QE ,
BE UE − rE pE
where the two block equations are the discrete Darcy law and the discrete mass balance equation, respectively. The
rectangular matrix BE is the conventional ﬁnite volume discretization of the divergence operator multiplied by −|E|
for symmetry. The diagonal matrix CTE has the same entries and in the same order as BTE . The square mass matrix
ME is a key feature of the MFD construction and is explained in detail in [2]. This matrix is constructed such that the
ﬁrst equation is exact when the discrete unknowns correspond to a linear pressure and the related constant velocity.
The reaction coeﬃcient rE > 0 and the right-hand side QE come from the Peaceman model and the source/sink terms.
They are non-zero only for cells containing wells.

Figure 2: Illustration of a two-step coarsening procedure: exact elimination of internal degrees of freedom followed by approximate coarsening
of boundary ﬂuxes. Pressure unknowns are marked by circles, ﬂuxes are marked by arrows. Note that the macro-cell (right picture) may have
non-planar edges.

The global system is assembled from cell-based equations (3) and is closed by applying boundary conditions. The
assembly procedure results in cancellation of edge-based pressure unknowns. Thus, these unknowns are auxiliary and
do not require additional equations.
3.2. Multilevel hierarchy of models
In this section, we extend the M3 method to elliptic problems with non-zero reaction. It is suﬃcient to describe
only a two-level coarsening procedure that preserves the structure the of ﬁne-scale discrete equations. Then, the
multilevel method is obtained by recursion. Moreover, it is suﬃcient to describe the coarsening procedure for a single
macro-cell.
The procedure consists of two steps illustrated in Fig. 2. On the ﬁrst step, all internal ﬂuxes are eliminated and
one pressure unknown is introduced. This elimination is the exact; thus, no accuracy is lost at this step. The second
step is an approximate coarsening of the boundary ﬂuxes, which is based on the technology introduced in [13]. Note
that we ensure local mass conservation.
The reaction coeﬃcient changes the spectral properties of the corresponding matrices; therefore, the exact coarsening used in [13] will not work for macro-cells with non-zero reaction rate. We employ another idea proposed in
[10] for a diﬀusion problem with mixed cells. It was described for the case where the reaction coeﬃcient is positive
everywhere in Ω; however, the same idea works when the reaction coeﬃcient is positive only in a few cells.
Let us consider a macro-cell E M consisting of ﬁne-scale cells Ei , i = 1, . . . , N. The M3 method is more eﬃcient
when the number of cells in a macro-cell is small, about four in two dimensions. First, we assemble equations for
these cells into a macro-system (see left picture in Fig. 2). As we mentioned above, the assembly procedure results
in cancellation of edge-based pressure unknowns corresponding to internal (w.r.t. the macro-cell) edges. Second, we
split velocity unknowns into two groups. The ﬁrst group contains unknowns associated with the boundary edges of
E M . The other group contains unknowns associated with interior edges of E M . The macro-system can be written as
follows:

For the macro-cell shown in the left picture of Fig. 2, the size of vectors U1 , P1 is seven and the size of vectors U2 ,
P2 is three. We assume that the reaction coeﬃcient is non-zero at least for one cell Ei in the macro-cell. Thus, the
diagonal matrix R is non-zero, but may have up to N − 1 zero entries.
Step 1. The goal of the ﬁrst step in the coarsening procedure is to form a smaller system:

where r M is the mean reaction rate and p M is the mean pressure in the macro-cell.
The third block equation in (4) is simply N mass balance equations for N cells Ei . Summing up these equations,
we get cancellation of terms containing interior ﬂuxes. More precisely, let e be the vector with equal components and
unit norm. Following the proof of Lemma 3.1 in [11], we observe that every row of BT2 has exactly two non-zero
entries with equal values but opposite signs. Thus, the null space of this matrix consists of vectors αe and
N

eT (B1 U1 + B2 U2 − RP2 ) = eT B1 U1 −

rEi pEi = eT Q.

i=1

Comparing this with the last block equation in (5), we get
N

B1 = eT B1 ,

rM pM =

ri pEi ,

Q M = eT Q,

i=1

where r M is the mean reaction rate which will be deﬁned later in (8).
The square system (4) can be solved for U1 by eliminating ﬁrst U2 and then P2 . This gives

A22 = R + B2 M−1

(7)

B = B1 − B2 M−1
22 M21 .

It is known that the Schur complement A11 of the positive deﬁnite matrix is the positive deﬁnite matrix. Let us
make the ﬁrst block equation in (5) out of equation (7) and the mass balance equation (6) for the macro-cell E M . The
ingenious idea proposed in [10], is to split matrix A−1
22 into a semi-positive matrix and the projector on space of vectors
αe. Here, we slightly modify the original proof for the case when matrix R has zero entries.
Lemma 3.1. Let the diagonal semi-positive deﬁnite matrix R have at least one positive entry. Then, the matrix A22 is
positive deﬁnite. Moreover, the following splitting holds:
A−1
22 = D +

1 T
ee ,
σ2

where D is a semi-positive deﬁnite matrix and σ2 = eT R e.
Proof. The matrix A22 is at least semi-positive deﬁnite as the sum of two semi-positive deﬁnite matrices R and
T

T

22 B2 . Thus, x A22 x = 0 if x B2 M22 B2 x = 0 and x R x = 0. The ﬁrst equality implies that x = αe. Then, the
second equality gives α = 0. Thus, the matrix A22 is positive deﬁnite.
The matrix D is semi-positive deﬁnite if
xT D x = xT A−1

Since A22 has full rank, we deﬁne the arbitrary vector x as follows: x = A22 y. Then,

(e A22 y)2 = yT A22 y − 2 (yT R e)2 ≥ yT R y − 2 (yT R y)(eT R e) = 0.

The equality holds when y = e. Then, x = A22 e = R e is the eigenvector of matrix D corresponding to zero eigenvalue.
This proves the assertion of the lemma.

The desired result (the ﬁrst equation in (5)) follows if the mean reaction rate is deﬁned as
r M = σ2 = eT R e ,

(8)

which represents volume averaging of the reaction rates in cells Ei . This completes Step 1 of the coarsening procedure.
Step 2. The goal of the second (approximate) step in the coarsening procedure is to replace the ﬁne-scale boundary
ﬂuxes with coarse-scale ﬂuxes, such that the resulting system for the macro-cell E M has the same structure as the
original system of equations (3) for each cell Ei .
Without loss of generality, we consider a macro-edge f M consisting of two ﬁne-scale edges f1 and f2 . The conservative coarsening implies that
(9)
| f1 | u f1 + | f2 | u f2 = (| f1 | + | f2 |) u fM
holds exactly, regardless of the employed coarsening procedure. Let us deﬁne a parameter
⎧
⎪
⎪
⎨ u f1 /u f2 , if u f2 0,
αM = ⎪
⎪
⎩ 1,
otherwise .
Then, the conservation property (9) is satisﬁed when
u f1 =

α M (| f1 | + | f2 |)
u f ≡ β f1 u fM ,
α M | f1 | + | f2 | M

u f2 =

| f1 | + | f2 |
u f ≡ β f2 u f M .
α M | f1 | + | f2 | M

We refer to parameter α M as the ﬂux moment on macro-edge f M and to parameters β f1 and β f2 as the ﬂux coarsening
parameters. Unfortunately, calculation of α M requires solution of the ﬁne-scale pressure equation. The idea of the M3
method is to calculate the ﬂux moments α M approximately and only a few times (10-20) during a simulation.
Eﬃcient calculation of the ﬂux moments is equivalent to eﬃcient calculation of approximate ﬁne-scale ﬂuxes. The
algebraic multigrid (AMG) method is ideally suited for unstructured polygonal meshes and heterogeneous permeability ﬁelds with long correlation lengths. AMG is applied to a system for edge-based pressure unknowns, which is
obtained by local elimination of other unknowns. A similar elimination procedure is often used in mixed-hybrid ﬁnite
element methods. Additional eﬃciency is achieved by selecting a relatively crude tolerance εAMG (10−1 − 10−3 ) for
termination of the AMG iterations. Usually, 5 − 15 V-cycle iterations is required to achieve this tolerance. Good spectral properties of the V-cycle preconditioner guarantee the accurate evaluation of the edge-based pressure unknowns,
and hence, the ﬂux moments.
Additional accuracy in the multiscale simulation is achieved by adaptive update of the ﬂux moments [15]. This
adaptive strategy provides a mechanism to control the L2 -norm of saturation error. In [15], we observed a 2 − 3 times
smaller error compared to the uniform-in-time update strategy.
To complete the mathematical derivations, we introduce vectors U M and P M of macro-edge ﬂuxes and pressures,
respectively. For the macro-cell shown on the right picture in Fig. 2, the size of these vectors is four. Using the ﬂux
coarsening parameters, we obtain a linear relationship U1 = LU M . Inserting this into (5), and multiplying the ﬁrst
equation by LT , we get
M M U M + BTM p M − CTM P M = 0,
(10)
= QM ,
BM UM − rM pM
where

M M = LT M11 L,

B M = B1 L,

CTM P M = LT CT P1 .

We have freedom in deﬁning the square matrix CTM . By analogy with the ﬁne-scale system (3), we deﬁne CTM as
the diagonal matrix with the same entries as in the column-matrix BTM . The global coarse-grid system is assembled
from the macro-cell-based equations (10) and is closed by applying boundary conditions. Due to deﬁnition of matrix
CTM , this assembly procedure results in cancellation of macro-edge-based pressure unknowns. This completes the
derivation of the coarse-grid model.
Remark 3.1. In general, the matrix M M cannot be derived using the MFD method on the macro-cell E M with any
upscaled permeability tensor. This is the essential diﬀerence between upscaling of a process model and upscaling of
parameters in a process model.

The coarsening procedure described above can be repeated again resulting in a multilevel hierarchy of massconservative models. In the numerical experiment described below, this hierarchy has seven levels. The accuracy
can be controlled by adjusting the AMG tolerance εAMG and by increasing the number of global updates of the ﬂux
moments, α M .
3.3. Fine-scale and multiscale simulations
A ﬁne-scale simulation solves the ﬁne-scale diﬀusion problem on each time step with a tolerance 10−12 . The cost
of the diﬀusion solver is usually more than 80% of the simulation time.
Depending on the problem size, the M3 simulation may reduce cost of the diﬀusion solver to less than 8%. This
includes creation and support of the multilevel hierarchy of models. The memory overhead depends on the coarsening
strategy and is less than 50% for the most popular choice of 2 × 2 macro-cells.
The M3 simulation re-builds the multilevel hierarchy of models a few times during the simulation. The global
updates may be distributed uniformly [13] or adaptively [15] in time. The ﬂux coarsening parameters are frozen
between the global updates. On each time step, we solve to high precision the pressure model on the coarsest grid,
and interpolate velocities to the ﬁne-scale mesh using the ﬂux moments α M and the matrices M M . The saturation is
updated using the explicit upwind time integration method [12].
Remark 3.2. The saturation can be updated on a composite mesh composed of cells from various levels in the
multilevel hierarchy. Dynamic (adaptive) selection of the composite mesh is possible on each time step, for instance,
to track accurately water fronts and sharp saturation changes in general. This strategy is not yet implemented in the
M3 method, since it may require upscaling of the hyperbolic equation, which is an active research area [6].
Between the global updates, the M3 method updates the multilevel hierarchy locally, following changes in the total
mobility λ(S ), which varies signiﬁcantly in the vicinity of water fronts. The macro-cell matrices are recalculated if
mobility change exceeds a threshold value:
1
λn
<
< 1 + ελ ,
1 + ελ λn−1

(11)

where λn is total mobility at time tn and ελ = 0.1, as suggested in [8]. Violation of these criteria in one ﬁne-scale cell
requires the update at most L cells, where L is number of levels in the multilevel hierarchy.
4. Numerical experiment
We deﬁne the relative permeability of water (w) and oil (o) phases as follows:
krw (S ) = (S ∗ )2 ,

kro (S ) = (1 − S ∗ )2 ,

S∗ =

S − S wr
,
1 − S wr − S or

(12)

where S ∗ is the normalized wetting phase saturation, and S wr = S or = 0.1 are the residual saturations. The initial
saturation is set to a constant, S (t = 0) = S wr = 0.1, the constant porosity is φ = 0.2, and the phase viscosities are
μo = 4 cP and μw = 1 cP.
Let Ω be the square computational domain of size 1000m × 1000m. First, a scalar permeability ﬁeld K = K I
is generated on the square 256 × 256 mesh by the GSLIB library such that its logarithm, log10 (1012 K), is normally
distributed with mean zero and variance four. The correlation lengths along the principle axes of statistical anisotropy
are 0.8 and 0.04, leading to a strongly layered structure with a dynamic range of approximately six orders of magnitude
(left picture in Fig. 1). The principle axes are rotated counter clockwise by 60◦ . Second, the mesh is coarsened three
times away from the wells as shown on the right picture in Fig. 1. Third, upscaling of either the permeability ﬁeld or
the problem in coarse-grid cells is required.
The M3 methods allows us to use the upscaled problems (see (10)) in coarse-grid cells. However, to illustrate
ability of the M3 method to handle full tensors, we upscale the permeablities which leads to a full tensor [9]. The
dominant layered structure of the permeability ﬁeld allows us to employ simpler one-dimensional upscaling arguments
to estimate permeability in the direction aligned with the layers and in the orthogonal direction. Thus, the principle

axes of the upscaled tensor are rotated counter clockwise by 60◦ . The eigenvalues of the upscaled permeability tensor
are arithmetic (along the layered structure) and harmonic (in the transverse direction) means of the ﬁne-scale ﬁeld.
In the numerical experiments, we consider the well conﬁguration shown in Fig. 1. The injection wells are A and
B and operate with constant injection rate 500 m3 per day. The production wells are C and D and operate at constant
pressure 4000 psi. The no-ﬂow boundary condition is imposed on ∂Ω. The multilevel hierarchy of models is built
using 2 × 2 coarsening strategy, which results in seven levels. The coarsest model corresponds to a 4 × 4 mesh. In
Fig. 3, snapshots of the ﬁne-scale and multiscale solutions at time T = 0.3 PV I are plotted. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences
are observed in the eye-ball norm. The M3 method reduced the simulation time by approximately seven times.
In the left picture of Fig. 4, we plot water-cut curves for the well C. The diﬀerence in solution proﬁles around the
break-through time is of a particular interest in ﬂow simulations. This area is zoomed in the right picture of Fig. 4.
Both plots demonstrate that the ﬁne-scale and multiscale solutions are very close to each other, and the calculated
diﬀerence between them is less than 5%. The right picture of Fig. 4 reveals the earlier breakthrough time in the
ﬁne-scale solution; however, the relative error in the breakthrough time is less than 1%.

We extended the multiscale multilevel mimetic (M3 ) method to well-driven ﬂows in porous media. We demonstrated its ability to treat accurately non-orthogonal locally-reﬁned meshes and tensorial material properties. In the
future, we plan to reduce cost of the transport equation in the M3 simulation.
