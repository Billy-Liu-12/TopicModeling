Abstract. In this paper we present a model where two interconnected
network operators compete in linear prices in a market characterized by
the existence of social connections among consumers, which are represented by a random regular graph. Assuming horizontal diﬀerentiation
among operators, the customers select their network provider based on
their preferences and the prices oﬀered by the competing ﬁrms. In equilibrium the number of calls made to other agents depends on where they
are located in the social network.

Introduction

The study of network interconnection problems has been a very active area of research over the last decade. One of the main reasons for the interest in this topic
is its immediate impact in terms of regulatory policy, especially in telecommunication markets.1 The literature has studied the case where competing networks
need to be connected to their rivals in order to provide a service. In such a case,
the access charge can play a key role in terms of the equilibrium arising in a
competitive framework. For example, [7] developed a model where, in the presence of linear and nondiscriminatory pricing schemes to consumers, the access
charge can be used by the ﬁrms as a collusive device. That is, the ﬁrms can
agree to pay each other high access charges because their proﬁts are maximized
in this way. However, consumer and social surplus are reduced, consequently,
regulatory intervention is called for. However, a key assumption has not been
scrutinized enough. They assumed a balanced calling pattern, meaning that “the
percentage of calls originated on a network and completed on the same network
is equal to the fraction of consumers subscribing to this network”. In order to
represent the assumption in a simple way, they assume that demand is formed
by a continuous of individuals where each of them connects (or makes calls to)
other individuals with the same intensity if they are confronted with the same
price of the service.

In a mobile phone market, for example, this modeling approach implies that
each person, confronted to equal prices, would make the same number of calls
to their relatives and friends than to any other unrelated person in the market.
This unrealistic assumption is usually made for simplicity, because it permits to
characterize market shares for the ﬁrms in a very simple way. More importantly,
the assumption permits to characterize the equilibrium behavior of the players
using closed form expressions that facilitate the comparative static. However,
to the best of our knowledge, no attempt has been made to study the robustness of the results of these models to the presence of such a strong behavioral
assumption.
In this paper we depart from the traditional approach by abandoning the assumption of the existence of a continuous of consumers connecting to each other
with the same intensity. Instead, we present a model where two interconnected
network operators compete in linear and non discriminatory prices in a market
characterized by the existence of social connections among consumers, which
are modeled through a social network. The balanced calling pattern is no longer
an assumption, but it can arise in equilibrium.2 As usual, each operator has to
pay an access charge to its rival when the services demanded by its consumers
have to be completed in the rival network. Assuming horizontal diﬀerentiation
among operators,3 the customers select their preferred network based on their
tastes and the prices oﬀered by the competing ﬁrms. The main diﬀerence with
previous studies is that we recognize that an individual in the market belongs
to a social network,4 therefore, if he or she makes a call to an individual placed
closer in the network then he or she receives a higher utility than from a call to
an individual located farther away, even if the price for the service is the same.
As a consequence, in equilibrium the number of calls made to others depends on
where they are located in the social network.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we develop the
economic model, including the agent’s demand, the ﬁrms’ problem and the game
played by the two ﬁrms. In section 3 we obtain numerical results when the social
network is modeled using random regular graphs. In section 4 the conclusions
are stated.

The Economic Model

The model assumes the existence of a social network, represented by a graph g.
Nodes in the graph represent agents (indexed by i ∈ I) and the links show
how people are interconnected socially. There are two ﬁrms, A and B, oﬀering
comunication services (i.e. two cellular companies) and individuals have to decide
which ﬁrm to subscribe to. In order to make the aﬃliation decision, agents take

See [3] and [4] for results considering heterogenous agents.
Horizontal diﬀerentiation means that the services oﬀered by the competing networks
are not diﬀerent in quality, thereby consumer preferences determine aﬃliation decisions.
See [5] and [6] for further details on network theory and economics.

into account the price5 per call oﬀered by each ﬁrm, pA and pB , and his or her
taste. Taste is modeled in a standard way: each agent i in the social network
(i.e. each node in g) is endowed with a realization of a taste random variable xi ,
from a cumulative density function F with support in [0, 1]. In what follows we
assume that ﬁrm A is “located” in 0 and ﬁrm B in 1. None of them provide
the “ideal service” to agent i, positioned in xi (this would be the case if some
network were located precisely in xi ). Introducing a unit transportation cost of
t, the cost of selecting a service diﬀerent from i’s ideal one is txi if agent i selects
network A or t(1 − xi ) if network B is preferred.
2.1

The Agent Demand

Consider the aﬃliation decision problem of agent i. If agent i decides to connect
to network j = A, B then we will say that he/she belongs to the set Ij .
Agent i’s demand for calls is represented by the vector qi = (qij )j∈g,j=i , where
the generic element qij is the number of calls that agent i makes to agent j. Then
the gross utility of agent i can be described as follows:
1−1/η

λi δ tij u(qij )

Ui (qi ) =

with

u(qij ) =

j∈g,j=i

qij
1 − 1/η

(1)

where:
δ : is a discount factor, that is 0 < δ < 1.
tij : is the shortest distance (in terms of links) connecting agents i and j. The
more distant is j from i in the social network, the lower is the utility of a call.
If they are not connected then tij = ∞.
η : is a constant parameter representing the elasticity of demand.
λi : scale factor associated with the total amount of social connections of agent i.6
Now let us start assuming that i decides to connect to ﬁrm A. Given that
agent i observes the price of network A, pA , he/she is going to select the vector
of calls qi = (qij )j∈g,j=i to all his contacts in the network g so that:

⎫
⎨
⎬
qij
Vi (pA ) = max λi Ui (qi ) − pA
(2)

j∈g,j=i

Solving this maximization problem, we obtain his/her demand’s components:
qij (pA ) =

We just consider linear and non dicriminatory prices.

In the simulation we will use the scaling parameter λi = (δC(gi ) η )−1 , where C(gi )
stands for the total amount of connections of the agent.

Intuitively, for the same price pA , agent i makes more calls to contacts located
closer in the social network g than farther in it. Therefore, plugging into equation 2 we get the indirect utility function:

Vi (pA ) =
j∈g,j=i

pA 1−η

and an analogous result arise for ﬁrm B.
It is easy to see that each agent, given his/her taste parameter, will select
the network providing him/her the highest indirect utility net of transportation
costs. Agent i’s decision of aﬃliation will depend on his/her taste parameter
value xi in the following way: there is an x∗i representing an indiﬀerent value,
such that if xi < x∗i (resp. xi > x∗i ) he/she will join network A (resp. B). Such
x∗i is deﬁned by:
Vi (pA ) − x∗i t = Vi (pB ) − (1 − x∗i )t

Solving for x∗i ,7 we get:

The Firm’s Problem

Assuming that each ﬁrm pursues the maximization of its proﬁts and access
charges are given, then ﬁrm A (resp. B) will select its price pA (resp. pB ) such
that:
max πA (pA , pB ) =
pA

where:8
f : is the ﬁxed cost incurred by a ﬁrm when it aﬃliates a new subscriber.
coA : is the cost of originating a call for ﬁrm A (coB is deﬁned analogously).
cfA : is the cost of terminating a call for ﬁrm A (cfB is deﬁned analogously).
aA : is the price ﬁrm A charges ﬁrm B in order to terminate a call from a
subscriber of B to a subscriber of A (aB is deﬁned analogously).

It is important to note that x∗i does not depend on where i’s contacts are aﬃliated. This is not the case when networks are permitted to use diﬀerent linear prices
schemes for own and rival subscribers (the discriminatory case).
In what follows, when we solve an optimization problem, we assume that g, f, coA ,
coB , cfA , cfB , {xi }Ii=1 , t are all given exogenously.

The Game

We are interested in a Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (SPNE) of a two stage
game played by ﬁrms. We analyze two cases.
In the ﬁrst case, the unregulated case, ﬁrms are free to select noncooperatively
their access charges, aA and aB , in a ﬁrst stage and then, in the second stage,
they set noncooperatively the prices to consumers p∗A and p∗B .
In the second case, the regulated case, the access charges for both ﬁrms are determined exogenously in the ﬁrst stage (by a regulator) as equal to the marginal
costs (aA = aB = cfA = cfB ). In the second stage the ﬁrms set noncooperatively
the prices to consumers p∗A and p∗B .
In both cases we are interested in the equilibrium outcome and how it is modiﬁed when some parameters change. It is also in our interest to measure consumer
surplus, so given equilibrium prices (p∗A , p∗B ) in any of the cases described above,
we evaluate:
CS(p∗A , p∗B ) =

Numerical Results

The numerical study was performed using medium scale simulations. The social
network was modeled by random regular graphs of degree d, see [2]. The access
costs and prices varied within the predeﬁned range: [amin , amax ] , [pmin , pmax ].
The goal of the simulations was to compare the outcomes of the regulated and
unregulated cases. The methodology for the simulations in the unregulated case
was the following:9
0) Deﬁne parameters: I, d, σ, η, δ, coA , coB , cfA , cfB and f
1) Generate random graph of degree d.
2) Generate random vector of network preferences: x = (xi )i∈I
9

The methodology in the regulated case is trivially implied.

3) For each access charge proﬁle (aA , aB ) in [amin , amax ] × [amin , amax ] we solve
the second stage of the game:
(a) For each price proﬁle (pA , pB ) in [pmin , pmax ] × [pmin , pmax ]:
i) Compute indiﬀerence values: x∗ = (x∗i )i∈I
ii) Compute the utility functions of ﬁrms A and B:
πA (pA , pB ), πB (pA , pB )
(b) Compute price response functions:
rA (pA , pB ), rB (pA , pB )
(c) Compute SPNE price reaction functions in the second stage:
p∗A (aA , aB ), p∗B (aA , aB )
4) Going back to the ﬁrst stage, compute access cost response functions
raA (aA , aB ), raB (aA , aB )
5) Compute SPNE access charges in the ﬁrst stage a∗A , a∗B and evaluate price
reaction functions at these values: p∗A (a∗A , a∗B ), p∗B (a∗A , a∗B )
6) Evaluate indiﬀerence values at the equilibrium outcome:
x∗ (a∗A , a∗B ) = (x∗i (p∗A (a∗A , a∗B ), p∗B (a∗A , a∗B )))i∈I
7) Evaluate ﬁrms’ beneﬁts equilibrium outcome:
πA (p∗A (a∗A , a∗B ), p∗B (a∗A , a∗B )), πB (p∗A (a∗A , a∗B ), p∗B (a∗A , a∗B ))
8) Evaluate consumer surplus CS(p∗A (a∗A , a∗B ), p∗B (a∗A , a∗B )) as in eq. 10
9) Repeat steps (1) to (8) for T diﬀerent graphs keeping parameters deﬁned in
step (0) .
The size of the social network was ﬁxed at I = 1024 and random regular
graphs with degrees d = 10, 15, 20 were used. The access charge discretization
selected 5 values: 2 above and 2 below the regulated case. The price discretization
considered 20 equidistant values. Table 1 below contains average results for
simulations. The rest of the parameters were ﬁxed as follows: σ = 1, η = 1.5,
δ = 0.9, coA = coB = 0.75, cfA = cfB = 0.75 and f = 0.5.

Conclusions

Our preliminary results show that an eventual deregulation in the determination of access charges would have a big impact on the level of access charges
but a relatively minor impact on prices, utilities and consumer surplus. On the
other hand, an increase in the connectivity of the social network (implying an
increase in demand keeping constant the number of individuals forming the network) has a minor impact over access charges and prices, ceteris paribus the
regulatory environment. However, ﬁrms’ beneﬁts and consumer surplus increase
signiﬁcantly, especially in the regulated and unregulated case respectively, closing the gap between both regulatory frameworks. Overall the simulations show
that deregulation can be an attractive alternative in front of a costly regulation,
especially when the social network presents a high level of connectivity. This
result contrasts with the standard recommendations in the literature for the
interconnection problem under linear and nondiscriminatory pricing schemes.
