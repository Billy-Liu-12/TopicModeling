Abstract. Spherical Harmonic Transforms (SHTs) which are essentially Fourier
transforms on the sphere are critical in global geopotential and related
applications. Discrete SHTs are more complex to optimize computationally
than Fourier transforms in the sense of the well-known Fast Fourier Transforms
(FFTs). Furthermore, for analysis purposes, discrete SHTs are difficult to
formulate for an optimal discretization of the sphere, especially for applications
with requirements in terms of near-isometric grids and special considerations in
the polar regions. With the enormous global datasets becoming available from
satellite systems, very high degrees and orders are required and the implied
computational efforts are very challenging. The computational aspects of SHTs
and their inverses to very high degrees and orders (over 3600) are discussed
with special emphasis on information conservation and numerical stability.
Parallel and grid computations are imperative for a number of geodetic,
geophysical and related applications, and these are currently under
investigation.

1 Introduction
On the spherical Earth and neighboring space, spherical harmonics are among the
standard mathematical tools for analysis and synthesis (e.g., global representation of
the gravity field and topographic height data). On the celestial sphere, COBE, WMAP
and other similar data are also being analyzed using spherical harmonic transforms
(SHTs) and extensive efforts have been invested in their computational efficiency and
reliability (see e.g. [6], [7] and [17]).
In practice, when given discrete observations on the sphere, quadrature schemes
are required to obtain spherical harmonic coefficients for spectral analysis of the
global data. Various quadrature strategies are well known, such as equiangular and
equiareal. In particular, Gaussian quadratures are known to require the zeros of the
associated Legendre functions for orthogonality in the discrete computations. As
these zeros are not equispaced in latitude, the Gaussian strategies are often secondary
in applications where some regularity in partitioning the sphere is critical. Under such
requirements for equiangular grids in latitude and longitude, different optimization

schemes are available for the computations which become quite complex and
intensive for high degrees and orders. The approach of Driscoll and Healy [5] using
Chebychev quadrature with an equiangular grid is advantageous in this context.

using colatitude θ and longitude λ, where the basis functions Ynm (θ, λ ) are called the

all |m| < n and n = 0, 1, 2, …. This is an orthogonal decomposition in the Hilbert
space L2 (S 2 ) of functions square integrable with respect to the standard rotation

nonzero, i.e. f n,m ≡ 0 for all n > N.

In this geodetic formulation, the dashed overbars refer to the assumed normalization.
Colombo [1981] has discretized this formulation with θj = j π / N, j = 1, 2, …, N and
λk = k π / N, k = 1, 2, …, 2N.
Legendre quadrature is however well known to provide an exact representation of
polynomials of degrees up to 2N – 1 using only N data values at the zeros of the
Legendre polynomials. This, for example, was the quadrature employed by
Mohlenkamp [12] in his sample implementation of a fast Spherical Harmonic
Transform (SHT). Driscoll and Healy [5] have exploited these quadrature ideas in an
exact algorithm for a reversible SHT using the following (2N)2 grid data for degree
and order N - 1:
Given discrete data f(θ,λ) at θj = π j / 2N and λk = π k / N, j,k = 0,…,2N-1, the
analysis using a discrete SHT gives

which are also considered in the so-called (second) Neumann method where the
corresponding numerical solutions are evaluated for different choices of distinct
parallels θj, not necessarily equispaced in latitude [18]. Other related formulations are
briefly discussed in [2], [3], and also in [15].

3 Optimization of Discrete SHTs
A number of modifications have been developed for the preceding Driscoll and Healy
[5] formulation in view of the intended applications.
First, the geodetic normalization and conventions have been adopted and
implemented in the direct and inverse discrete SHTs. Geopotential and gravity
models usually follow the geodetic conventions. However, software packages such as
SpherePack [1] and SpharmonKit [14] use the mathematical normalization
convention. Also, the requirement that N be a power of 2 as stated explicitly by

Optimization of Spherical Harmonic Transform Computations

77

Driscoll and Healy [5] does not seem to be needed in the included mathematical
derivation of the Chebychev weights.
Second, the latitude partition has been modified to avoid polar complications,
especially in practical geodetic and geoscience applications. Two options have been
experimented with: First, using the previous latitude partition, θj = π j / 2N, with j =
1, …, 2N-1, as for j=0, the weight a0 = 0, and hence the North pole (θ = 0) needs not
be carried in the analysis and synthesis computations. Second, the latitude partition
can be redefined using θj = π (j + ½) / 2N for j = 0, …, 2N-1, with the same
longitude partition, i.e., λk = π k / N, k = 0, …, 2N-1. In this case, the Chebychev
weights aj (when N is not necessarily a power of 2) are redefined as dj, where
dj =

2

* π( j + ½) + N −1 1

(10)

for j = 0,…,2N-1, which are symmetric about mid-range. The grids of 2Nx2N nodes
with ∆θ = ½ ∆λ have also been modified to 2Nx4N nodes with ∆θ = ∆λ for the
majority of practical applications.
Third, hemispherical symmetries have been implemented. The equatorial
symmetry of this latitude partition is also advantageous to exploit the symmetries of
the associated Legendre functions, i.e.
Pnm (cos (π - θ)) = (-1)n+m Pnm (cos θ) .

(11)

This can be verified using the definition of the associated Legendre functions [19]
and is important for the efficiency of SHTs computations.
Fourth, the computations along parallels involve functions of longitude only and
lend themselves to Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs), and hence Fast Fourier
Transforms (FFTs) for computational efficiency in practice.
Fifth, to ensure numerical stability for degrees over 2000, quadruple precision
computation has been implemented. Also, parallel and grid computations are under
development.

4 Numerical Analysis Considerations
For high degrees and orders, the normalized associated Legendre functions
!!!
Pnm (cos θ) have to be used. However, as the normalizing factors in
!!!
Pnm (cos θ) =

2(2n + 1)(n − m)!
Pnm (cos θ)
(n + m)!

!!!
Pn (cos θ) = 2n + 1 Pn (cos θ)

(12)

get quite large for large n, it is important to use the recursive formulas directly in
Pnm (cos θ) . Otherwise,
terms of the normalized associated Legendre functions !!!
significant loss in numerical accuracy is observed for degrees over 60 even with such
software as the intrinsic spherical harmonic and Legendre functions in Mathematica©.

78

J.A.R. Blais, D.A. Provins, and M.A. Soofi

The normalized associated Legendre functions !!!
Pnm (cos θ) are computed following
Rapp [16] formulation. These recursive formulas have been used in geodesy for all
kinds of geopotential field applications for degree and order up to 1800, e.g. [20].
Attempts to exceed this limit using FORTRAN compilers available at the time found
that numerical accuracy which ranged from 10-11 to 10-13 for all colatitudes, degraded
substantially beyond that point. Wenzel observed accuracy of only 10-3 by degree
2000, which has been confirmed using REAL*8 specifications in Win 32 and AMD
64 environments. Experimentation with REAL*16 in AMD 64 and DEC Alpha
environments has demonstrated numerical stability for degrees over 3600. Other
recursive formulas are discussed in [15] and other publications, such as [10], [12]
and [19].

5 Numerical Experimentation
As indicated earlier, there are several formulations for employing spherical harmonics
as an analysis tool. One popular code that is readily available is Spherepack [1] of
which a new version has been released recently. Other experimental codes are those
of Driscoll and Healy [5] and the follow-ons, such as [8] and [14], plus the example
algorithm described by Mohlenkamp [11][12] and offered as a partial sample
implementation in [13]. Experimentation with these codes has shown scaling
differences from that which is expected in a geodetic context [15].
Using the Driscoll and Healy [5] formulation modified as described in Section 3,
extensive experimentation using different grids on several computer platforms in
double precision (i.e. REAL*8) and quadruple precision (i.e. REAL*16) has been
carried out. The first synthesis started with unit coefficients,
anm = bnm = 1, except for bn0 = 0,

(13)

for all degrees n and orders m, which corresponds to white noise. Then, following
analysis of the generated spatial grid values, the coefficients are recomputed and rootmean-square (RMS) values are given for this synthesis/analysis. Then after another
synthesis using these recomputed coefficients, RMS values of recomputed grid
residuals are given for the second synthesis. Hence, starting with arbitrary coefficients
{cnm}, the procedure can be summarized as follows:
SHT[SHT-1[{cnm}]] - [{cnm}]
and
SHT-1[SHT[SHT-1[{cnm}]]] - SHT-1[{cnm}]

→ RMS of first synthesis/analysis,
→

RMS of second synthesis.

Notice that the first RMS is in the spectral domain while the second is in the spatial
domain. The SHTs and SHT-1s are evaluated and re-evaluated explicitly to study
their numerical stability and the computational efficiency. The only simplification
implemented is in not recomputing the Fourier transforms in the second synthesis
following the inverse Fourier transforms in the second part of the analysis. The above
procedure is repeated for coefficients corresponding to 1/degree2, i.e. explicitly,

for all degrees n and orders m, which simulate a physically realizable
situation.Figures 1 show the plots of the RMS values in logarithmic scale and the
computation times for double precision computation with grid ∆θ = ½∆λ . The above
procedure is repeated for quadruple precision computations and for the grid ∆θ = ∆λ.
The results of the RMS values and the computation times are plotted in Figures 2.
The analysis and synthesis numerical results in double precision are stable up to
approximately degrees and orders 2000, as previously mentioned, and with quadruple
precision, the computations are very stable at least up to degree and order 3600.
Spectral analysis of the synthesis/analysis results can be done degree by degree to
study the characteristics of the estimated spectral harmonic coefficients. The results of
the second synthesis also enable a study of the spatial results parallel by parallel,
especially for the polar regions. Such investigations are currently underway to better
characterize the numerical stability and reliability of the SHT and SHT-1. Ongoing
experimentation is attempting to carry out the computations to higher degrees and
orders.

6 Concluding Remarks
Considerable work has been done on solving the computational complexities, and
enhancing the speed of calculation of spherical harmonic transforms. The approach
of Driscoll and Healy [5] is exact for exact arithmetic, and with a number of
modifications, different implementations have been experimented with, leading to
RMS errors of orders 10-16 to 10-12 with unit coefficients of degrees and orders up to
1800. Such RMS errors have been seen to increase to 10-3 with degrees and orders
around 2000. With quadruple precision arithmetic, RMS errors are of orders 10-31 to
10-29 with unit coefficients of degrees and orders 3600. Starting with spherical
harmonic coefficients corresponding to 1/degree2, the previously mentioned analysis
and synthesis results are improved to 10-17-10-16 and 10-35-10-34, respectively. The
latter simulations are perhaps more indicative of the expected numerical accuracies in
practice.
Computations for even higher degrees and orders are under consideration assuming
the availability of parallel FFT code in quadruple precision. As enormous quantities of
data are involved in the intended gravity field applications, parallel and grid computations
are imperative for these applications. Preliminary experimentation with parallel
processing in other applications has already been done and spherical harmonic
computations appear most appropriate for parallel and grid implement tations.
