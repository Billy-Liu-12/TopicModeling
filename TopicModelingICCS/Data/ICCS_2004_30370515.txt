Abstract. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps constitute an attractive modeling approach
that encompasses advantageous features. The most pronounces are the
flexibility in system design, model and control, the comprehensive operation
and the abstractive representation of complex systems. The main deficiencies of
FCMs are the critical dependence on the expert’s opinion and the potential
convergence to undesired steady states. In order to overcome these deficiencies
a possible solution is the utilization of learning methods to adapt the causeeffect relationships of the FCM model. This research work examines the
formulation of a weight adaptation method suitable for FCMs based on
nonlinear Hebbian-type learning algorithm. A process control problem is
presented and its control is investigated using the adaptation technique.

1 Introduction
Conventional methods were used, successfully, to model and control systems, in the
past years, but their contribution is limited in the representation, analysis and solution
of complex systems. In such systems, the inspection of their operation depends on
human knowledge. Generally, there is a great demand for the developing of
autonomous complex systems that can be achieved taking advantage of human like
reasoning. Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) seem to be capable to deal with situations
where the human reasoning process for any procedure includes uncertain descriptions.
FCMs are important modeling means for describing particular domains showing
the concepts (variables) and the relationships between them. FCMs can contribute to
the construction of more intelligent systems since a more intelligent a system
becomes, the more symbolic and fuzzy representations it utilizes.
Over the last 10 years, a variety of FCMs have been used for representing
knowledge and artificial intelligence in engineering applications, for instance, fault
detection [1], geographical information systems [2] and modelling the supervision of
distributed systems [3]. FCMs have been also used for several tasks like web data
mining [4], and medical decision-making [5].

In this research work we propose a learning methodology for fine-tuning FCM
causal links in order to update the initial experts’ knowledge and to control a process
problem efficiently. In general, experts in a certain domain make the task of creating
Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs), but it is very promising the learning of FCMs from
the initial experts’ knowledge and experience. Till today, very few research efforts
have been made to investigate and propose a learning algorithm suitable for FCMs
[6,7,8,9]. The introduction of FCM weight adaptation technique eliminates the
deficiencies in the usage of FCM and enhances the dynamical behavior and flexibility
of the FCM model.

2 Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Background
FCMs are special kind of cognitive maps and have been introduced by Kosko [9] to
represent fuzzy cause effect relationships instead of the crisp cause-effect relations
represented in the original cognitive maps. FCMs are fuzzy signed digraphs with
feedback. Nodes in the graph are fuzzy sets and represent concepts. Directed edges
represent causal effect relationships between the concepts as the case of generic
cognitive maps.
The FCM structure is similar to a recurrent artificial neural network, where
concepts are represented by neurons and causal relationships by weighted links
connecting the neurons. Concepts reflect characteristics, of the system.
Interconnections among concepts of FCM signify the cause and effect relationship
that a concept has on the others. These weighted interconnections represent the
direction and degree with which concepts influence the value of the interconnected
concepts. Figure 1 illustrates the graphical representation of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map.
The interconnection strength between two nodes C j and Ci is w ji , with w ji taking
on any value in the range –1 to 1.
There are three possible types of weights among concepts:
indicates positive causality between concepts C j and Ci ,

w ji > 0 which

w ji < 0 and w ji = 0 .

The value of each concept is calculated, computing the influence of other concepts to
the specific concept, by applying the following calculation rule:

= f( A (

A ( k ) is the vector of values of concepts Ci at iteration step k, and f is the
−x
sigmoid threshold function f ( x ) = 1 (1 + e ) .
The output vector A after the implementation of the threshold function is used as
where

the input vector for the (k+1) stage. This new input vector is again operated on the
weight matrix. The following algorithm expresses the FCM interactions.

By studying the final state of the iterations, we infer for the model. Equilibrium in
the system is attained when we have a set of repeated patterns. Repeated patterns can
be fixed points or limit cycles or a chaotic attractor. The “chaotic attractor” is a limit
cycle consisting of repeating patterns of differing lengths.
The methodology for developing FCMs is based on a group of experts who are
asked to define concepts and describe relationships among concepts and use IF-THEN
rules to justify their cause and effect suggestions among concepts and infer a
linguistic weight for each interconnection. A more detailed description about the
development of FCMs is given in [10].
The most significant weaknesses of the FCMs are their dependence on the expert’s
opinion and the uncontrollable convergence to undesired states. Learning procedures
is a mean to increase the efficiency of FCMs, by modifying the FCM weight matrix.

Learning Methods for Fuzzy Cognitive Maps

Fuzzy Cognitive Map learning involves updating the strengths of causal links so that
FCM converge in a desired region. An advanced learning strategy is to modify FCMs
by fine-tuning its initial causal link or edge strengths through training algorithms
similar to that in artificial neural networks.
Up-to-date, there have been proposed just a few unsupervised learning algorithms
for FCMs [6,7,8] and they are mostly based on ideas coming from the field of
artificial neural networks training. Kosko has proposed the first algorithm, named
Differential Hebbian Learning, as a form of unsupervised learning, but without any
mathematical formulation and implementation in real problems [6]. There is no
guarantee that DHL will encode the sequence into the FCM and till today no concrete
procedures exist for applying DHL in FCMs. Another method is the Adaptive
Random Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (ARFCMs), which are trained with a reinforcement

518

learning law. They are based on the theoretical aspects of Random Neural Networks
and can be used like associative memories [7]. Despite the recent fusion of FCMs and
Random Neural Networks, the resulted Adaptive Random FCM has not any
significant results in real dynamic system modeling.
Also, a different approach has been proposed for FCM learning, which is based on
evolutionary computation [9]. This technique is exactly the same used in neural
networks training. It doesn’t take into consideration the initial structure and experts’
knowledge for the FCM model and the calculated weights appear large deviations
from the actual FCM weights without accepted physical meaning. So, a formal
learning methodology suitable for FCMs and for practical applications is still needed.

Weight Adaptation Method Based on Nonlinear Hebbian
Learning

The proposed weight adaptation procedure is based on the Nonlinear Hebbian
Learning rule. The proposed nonlinear Hebbian-type rule for ANNs learning [10]
have been adapted and modified for the FCM case, determining the Nonlinear
Hebbian Learning (NHL) algorithm.
This learning algorithm is based on the premise that all the concepts in FCM
model are triggering at each iteration step and change their values. During this
triggering process the weight w ji of the causal interconnection of the related
concepts is updated and the modified weight
( k +1)

The value Ai

of Ci , concept at iteration k + 1 , is calculated, computing the

influence of interconnected concepts with values

is derived for iteration k .

at iteration k , through the following equation:

(2)

Furthermore, some of concepts are defined as Desired Output Concepts (DOCs).
These concepts stand for the factors and characteristics of the system that interest us,
and we want to estimate their values, which represent the final state of the system.
The distinction of FCM concepts as inputs or outputs is determined by the group of
experts for each specific problem. experts select the output concepts and they consider
the rest as initial stimulators of the system. The learning algorithm that extracts
hidden and valuable knowledge of experts can increase the effectiveness of FCMs.
Taking the advantage of the general nonlinear Hebbian-type learning rule for NNs,
[10], we introduce the mathematical formalism. The proposed rule has the general
mathematical form:
( k −1)

∆w ji = ηk Ai ( Aj − w ji
Ai )
(3)
where the coefficient η is a very small positive scalar factor called learning
(k )

parameter and is determined using experimental trial and error method in order to

A Weight Adaptation Method for Fuzzy Cognitive Maps

optimize the final solution. We propose the following form of nonlinear weight
adaptation algorithm:

w ji

(k )

= γ ⋅ w ji

( k −1)

+ η ( k ) Ai ( A j

(k )

− w ji

( k −1)

Ai )

(4)

where the η is the learning rate parameter and γ is the weight decay parameter.
The value of each concept of FCM is updated, through the eq. (2) where the value
of weight

w ji

(k )

is calculated using eq. (4). Only the initially non-zero weights

suggested by experts are updated for each iteration step. All the other weights remain
equal to zero.
Also, we use two criteria functions for the termination of the proposed algorithm.
One criterion is the maximization of a function J , which has been defined by Hebb’s
rule in [10]. The J have been proposed for the NHL examining the values of DOCs.
The J is defined as: J =

l

∑ ( DOC
i =1

i

)2

(5)

where l is the number of DOCs.
The second criterion is the minimization of the variation of two subsequent values
of DOCs, represented in equation:
(6)
DOC (j k +1) − DOC (j k ) < e
in order to terminate the iterative process of the learning algorithm. The term e is a
tolerance level keeping the variation of values of DOC(s) as low as possible and it is
proposed equal to e = 0.001 , satisfying the termination of iterative process.

Step 7: Return the final weights wNHL .
A generic description of the proposed NHL Algorithm for FCMs is given in
Algorithm 2. In NHL algorithm, upper and lower bounds for the learning rate
parameters γ and η are determined using trial and error experiments, 0 < η < 0.1

and 0.9 < γ < 1 , respectively, and then constant values for each one are proposed
for each case-study problem.

An Industrial Process Control Problem

A process control problem encountered in chemical industry is selected to illustrate
the workings of the proposed weight adaptation algorithm. The process control

520

problem is a part of a chemical plant consisting of two tanks, three valves, one heating
element and two thermometers for each tank, as depicted in Figure 2.
For this system a FCM model has been constructed in [3]. Variables and states of
the system, such as the height of the liquid in each tank or the temperature, are the
concepts of an FCM, which describes the system. For this simple system eight
concepts are proposed and they give a good model of the system:
Concept 1: The height of the liquid in tank 1. The height of liquid is dependent on
state of valve 1 and valve 2.
Concept 2: The height of the liquid in tank 2. The height of liquid is dependent on
state of valve 2 and valve 3.
Concept 3: The state of the valve 1. The valve is open, closed or partially open.
Concept 4: The state of the valve 2. The valve is open, closed or partially open.
Concept 5: The state of the valve 3. The valve is open, closed or partially open.
Concept 6: The temperature of the liquid in tank 1.
Concept 7: The temperature of the liquid in tank 2.
Concept 8: Describes the operation of the heating element, which has different levels
of operation and which increases the temperature of the liquid in tank 1.

Fig. 2. The illustration for the process control example

These concepts are connected with each other. The signs and the weight of each
connection have been determined in [3]. The interconnections among concepts can
easily be changed and some new can be added or others can be removed if the human
operator decides so, in order to have a better model and operation of the system.
Three experts constructed the FCM. The experts determine the cause-effect
relationship among concepts. Each connection between concepts has a weight, which
ranges between [-1,1] and was determined by a group of experts. Each concept of the
FCM takes a value, which ranges in the interval [0,1] and it is obtained after threshold
the real measurement of the variable or state, which each concept represent.
The control objective is to keep values of these variables in the following range of
values:
(7)
0.5 ≤ C1 ≤ 0.75, 0.75 ≤ C 2 ≤ 0.8, 0.75 ≤ C 6 ≤ 0.80, 0.65 ≤ C 7 ≤ 0.70
The values of the weights will be determined after training the FCM using NHL
algorithm. The DOCs in this problem, as experts propose them, are the concepts: C1
of “Tank 1”, C2 of “Tank 2”, C6 of “Temperature 1” and C7 of “Temperature 2”.
Experts have suggested the appropriate initial weights of the FCM model that are
shown in the following weight matrix in eq. (8). The desired regions for the DOCs,
which reflect the proper operation of the modeled system, have been prespecified in
eq. (7).

Simulation Results

First, before the implementation and testing of the proposed NHL algorithm, we apply
the typical Algorithm 1 to find the final state of the iterations in the previously
described chemical process control problem. The initial values of concepts given in
0

vector A =[0.48 0.57 0.58 0.68 0.59 0.59 0.52 0.58] and the initial weight matrix

w initial are used in Algorithm 1 to calculate the final state of the process. After 10
equil
=[0.6256 0.733 0.7675 0.860 0.7704
iterations the equilibrium state is reached A
0.739 0.681 0.7548]. It is observed that the values for C2 and C6, in final state, are out
of the suggested desired regions in eq. (7).
Next, the NHL algorithm is applied to train the FCM and modify the weights. This
experiment concerns the weight adaptation of the FCM model for the specific case
problem to converge in the desired convergence region, determining the appropriate
values of cause-effect relationships among concepts (weights). The process starts by
applying the same initial vector

A 0 and weights w initial . Notably, only the initially

non-zero weights that connect the triggering concepts are updated at each iteration
step The suggested exponential attenuation value of learning parameter η is 0.04 and
the associate value for weight decay parameter γ is 0.98, after trial and error
experiments, for fast system convergence in desired regions. If the learning
parameters η , γ , take different values than the proposed ones, but within the
initially suggested limits, then the system will converge in undesired regions.
The proposed algorithmic procedure continues, until the two termination criteria
are met. The result of training the FCM is a set of connection weights w ji that
satisfies the termination criteria. After 12 iteration cycles, the system converges and
the updated weight matrix is the following:

which leads the FCM to the steady state:

These new values for weights describe new relationships among the concepts of FCM
and the DOCs are within the desired regions. Thus the weight adaptation method
adjusts the FCM cause-effect relationships and controls the system convergence in
accepted steady states.

Conclusions

In this paper, the unsupervised weight learning method, namely Nonlinear Hebbian
Learning, is introduced to adapt the cause-effect relationships between concepts and
to eliminate the deficiencies that appear in operation of FCMs. In this way, we take
into account the dynamic characteristics of the learning process and the environment.
The proposed method for weight adaptation of FCM is presented and
accompanied with the good knowledge of a given system or process can contribute
towards the establishment of FCM as a robust technique. Also a formal methodology
suitable for process control problems has been developed and desired convergence
regions for problem have been produced. In future work, further developments of
learning algorithms will be examined.
