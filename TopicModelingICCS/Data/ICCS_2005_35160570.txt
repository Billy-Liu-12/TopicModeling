Abstract. We present the extended notion of pure exchange economy
under uncertainty, called an economy with awareness structure, where
each trader having a strictly monotone preference makes decision under his/her awareness and belief, and we introduce a generalized notion of equilibrium for the economy, called an expectations equilibrium
in awareness. We show the existence theorem of the equilibrium and the
fundamental welfare theorem for the economy, i.e., an allocation in the
economy is ex-ante Pareto optimal if and only if it is an expectations
equilibrium allocation in awareness.

Introduction

This article relates economies and distributed belief. We shall present a generalized notion of economy under uncertainty, called an economy with awareness
structure, where each trader makes decision in his/her awareness and belief under incomplete information. The purposes are: First, to introduce an extended
notion of expectations equilibrium for the economy, called an expectations equilibrium in awareness. Secondly, to show the fundamental welfare theorem for
the extended economy under expectations equilibrium in awareness.
Main Theorem. In a pure exchange economy under uncertainty, the traders
are assumed to have an awareness structure and they are risk averse. Then
an allocation in the economy is ex-ante Pareto optimal if and only if it is an
expectations equilibrium allocation in awareness for some initial endowment with
respect to some price system.
In Economic theory and its related ﬁelds, many authors have investigated
several notions of equilibrium in an economy under asymmetric information.1
They have studied the relationships between these equilibrium concepts (e.g.:

The existence theorem of equilibrium, the core equivalence theorem and the no
trade theorem etc.) One of the serious limitations of their analysis is to assume
‘partition’ structure as information the traders receive. From the epistemic point
of view, the partition structure represents the traders’ knowledge satisfying the
postulates: ‘Truth’ T (what is known is true), the ‘positive introspection’ 4
(that we know what we do) and the ‘negative introspection’ 5 (that we know
what we do not know). The postulate 5 is indeed so strong that describes the
hyper-rationality of traders, and thus it is particularly objectionable.
This raises the question to what extent results on the information partition structure (or the equivalent postulates of knowledge). The answer is to
strengthen the results: We shall weaken the conditions in the partition. This
relaxation can potentially yield important results in a world with imperfectly
Bayesian agents.
The idea has been performed in diﬀerent settings. Geanakoplos [5] showed the
no speculation theorem in the extended rational expectations equilibrium under
the assumption that the information structure is reﬂexive, transitive and nested.
The condition ‘nestedness’ is interpreted as a requisite on the ‘memory’ of the
trader. Einy et al [4] extended the core equivalence theorem of Aumann [1] to
the equivalence theorem between the ex-post core and the rational expectations
equilibria for an economy under asymmetric information. Recently, Matsuhisa [6]
gives an extension of the theorem into an economy under awareness structure. In his
line we establish the fundamental theorem for welfare into the generalized economy.
This article is organized as follows: In Section 2 we propose the model: An
economy with awareness structure and an expectations equilibrium in awareness.
In Section 3 we state explicitly the fundamental theorem for welfare economics
and sketch the proof. Finally we conclude by remarks.

The Model

Let Ω be a non-empty finite set called a state space and 2Ω the ﬁeld 2Ω consisting
of all subsets of Ω. Each member of 2Ω is called an event and each element of Ω
called a state. We denote by T the set of the traders. We shall present a model
of awareness according to E. Dekel et al [3].2
2.1

Awareness, Belief and Information

A belief structure is a tuple Ω, (Bt )t∈T in which Bt : 2Ω → 2Ω is trader t’s
belief operator. The interpretation of the event Bt E is that ‘t believes E.’ An
awareness structure is a tuple Ω, (At )t∈T , (Bt )t∈T in which Ω, (Bt )t∈T is a
belief structure and At is t’s awareness operator on 2Ω deﬁned by
PL
2

At E = Bt E ∪ Bt ( Ω \ Bt E )

for every E in 2Ω .

A diﬀerent approach of awareness models is discussed in R. Fagin, J.Y. Halpern,
Y. Moses and M.Y. Vardi, Reasoning about Knowledge. The MIT Press, Cambridge,
Massachusetts, London, England, 1995.

The interpretation of At E is that ‘t is aware of E.’ The property PL says
that t is aware of E if he believes it or if he believes that he does not believe
it.
We shall give the generalized notion of information partition in the line of
Bacharach [2] as follows.
Definition 1. The associated information structure (Pt )t∈T with awareness
structure Ω, (At ), (Bt ) is the class of t’s associated information functions
Pt : Ω → 2Ω deﬁned by Pt (ω) = E∈ 2Ω {E | ω ∈ Bt E}. (If there is no event E
for which ω ∈ Bt E then we take Pt (ω) to be undeﬁned.) We denote by Dom(Pt )
the set {ω ∈ Ω | Pt (ω) = ∅}, called the domain of Pt .
The mapping Pt is called reflexive if:
Ref

ω ∈ Pt (ω)

for every ω ∈ Dom(Pt ),

and it is said to be transitive if:
Trn

ξ ∈ Pt (ω) implies Pt (ξ) ⊆ Pt (ω) for any ξ, ω ∈ Dom(Pt ).

Furthermore Pt is called symmetric if:
Sym

ξ ∈ Pt (ω) implies Pt (ξ)

ω for any ω and ξ ∈ Dom(Pt ).

Remark 1. M. Bacharach [2] introduces the strong epistemic model equivalent
to the Kripke semantics of the modal logic S5. The strong epistemic model is a
tuple Ω, (Kt )t∈T in which t’s knowledge operator Kt : 2Ω → 2Ω satisﬁes the
ﬁve postulates: For every E, F of 2Ω ,
N Kt Ω = Ω,
4 Kt F ⊆ Kt Kt F ,

K
5

Kt (E ∩ F ) = Kt E ∩ Kt F ,
Ω \ Kt F ⊆ Kt (Ω \ Kt F ).

T

Kt F ⊆ F ;

t’s associated information function Pt induced by Kt makes a partition of Ω,
called t’s information partition, which satisﬁes the postulates Ref, Trn and
Sym. This is just the Kripke semantics corresponding to the logic S5; the
postulates Ref, Trn and Sym are respectively equivalent to the postulates
T, 4 and 5. The strong epistemic model can be interpreted as the awareness
structure Ω, (At ), (Bt ) such that Bt is the knowledge operator. In this situation it is easily veriﬁed that At must be the trivial operator, 3 and that
Dom(Pt ) = Ω.
2.2

Economy with Awareness Structure

A pure exchange economy under uncertainty is a structure
E = T, Ω, e, (Ut )t∈T , (πt )t∈T
3

I.e. At (F ) = Ω for every F ∈ 2Ω .

consisting of the following structure and interpretations: There are l commodities
in each state of the state space Ω; the consumption set of each trader t is Rl+ ;
an initial endowment is a mapping e : T × Ω → Rl+ with which e(t, ·) : Ω →
Rl+ is called t’s initial endowment; Ut : Rl+ × Ω → R is t’s von-Neumann
and Morgenstern utility function; πt is a subjective prior on Ω for t ∈ T . For
simplicity, πt is assumed to be full support for all t ∈ T . That is, πt (ω) = 0 for
every ω ∈ Ω.
Definition 2. A pure exchange economy with awareness structure is a structure
E A = E, (At )t∈T , (Bt )t∈T , (Pt )t∈T , in which E is a pure exchange economy
under uncertainty, and Ω, (At )t∈T , (Bt )t∈T , (Pt )t∈T is an awareness structure
with (Pt )t∈T the associated information structure. By the domain of the economy
E A we mean Dom(E A ) = ∩t∈T Dom(Pt ). We always assume that Dom(E A ) = ∅.
Remark 2. An economy under asymmetric information is an economy E A with
the awareness structure Ω, (At )t∈T , (Bt )t∈T given by the strong epistemic
model, and that Dom(E A ) = Ω.
We denote by Ft the ﬁeld of Dom(Pt ) generated by {Pt (ω)| ω ∈ Ω} and denote
by Πt (ω) the atom containing ω ∈ Dom(Pt ). We denote by F the join of all
Ft (t ∈ T ) on Dom(E A ); i.e. F = ∨t∈T Ft , and denote by {Π(ω)| ω ∈ Dom(E A )}
the set of all atoms Π(ω) containing ω of the ﬁeld F = ∨t∈T Ft . We shall often
refer to the following conditions: For every t ∈ T ,
A-1
t∈T e(t, ω) > 0 for each ω ∈ Ω.
A-2 e(t, ·) is F-measurable on Dom(Pt ).
A-3 For each x ∈ Rl+ , the function Ut (x, ·) is at least F-measurable on Dom(E A ),
and the function: T × Rl+ → R, (t, x) → Ut (x, ω) is Σ × B-measurable where
B is the σ-ﬁeld of all Borel subsets of Rl+ .
A-4 For each ω ∈ Ω, the function Ut (·, ω) is strictly increasing on Rl+ , continuous, strictly quasi-concave and non-satiated on Rl+ . 4
2.3

Expectations Equilibrium in Awareness

An assignment is a mapping x : T × Ω → Rl+ such that for each t ∈ T , the
function x(t, ·) is at least F-measurable on Dom(E A ). We denote by Ass(E A )
the set of all assignments for the economy E A . By an allocation we mean an
assignment a such that a(t, ·) is F-measurable on Dom(E A ) for all t ∈ T and
A
t∈T a(t, ω) ≤
t∈T e(t, ω) for every ω ∈ Ω. We denote by Alc(E ) the set of
all allocations.
We introduce the revised notion of trader’s expectation of utility in E A . By t’s
ex-ante expectation we mean Et [Ut (x(t, ·)] :=
ω∈Dom(Pt ) Ut (x(t, ω), ω)πt (ω)
for each x ∈ Ass(E A ). The interim expectation Et [Ut (x(t, ·)|Pt ] is deﬁned
by Et [Ut (x(t, ·)|Pt ](ω) :=
ξ∈Dom(Pt ) Ut (x(t, ξ), ξ)πt ({ξ} ∩ At ({ξ})|Pt (ω)) on
4

That is, for any x ∈ Rl+ there exists an x ∈ Rl+ such that Ui (x , ω) > Ui (x, ω).

Dom(Pt ). It should be noted that we use not the usual notion of posterior
πt ({ξ}|Pt (ω)) but the revised one πt ({ξ} ∩ At ({ξ})|Pt (ω)).5
A price system is a non-zero function p : Ω → Rl+ which is F-measurable on
Dom(E A ). We denote by ∆(p) the partition on Ω induced by p, and denote by
σ(p) the ﬁeld of Ω generated by ∆(p). The budget set of a trader t at a state
ω for a price system p is deﬁned by Bt (ω, p) := { x ∈ Rl+ | p(ω) · x ≤ p(ω) ·
e(t, ω) }. Deﬁne the mapping ∆(p) ∩ Pt : Dom(Pt ) → 2Ω by (∆(p) ∩ Pt )(ω) :=
∆(p)(ω) ∩ Pt (ω). We denote by Dom(∆(p) ∩ Pt ) the set of all states ω in which
∆(p)(ω) ∩ Pt (ω) = ∅. Let σ(p) ∨ Ft be the smallest σ-ﬁeld containing both the
ﬁelds σ(p) and Ft .
Definition 3. An expectations equilibrium in awareness for an economy E A
with awareness structure is a pair (p, x), in which p is a price system and x is
an assignment satisfying the following conditions:
EA1. x is an allocation;
EA2. For all t ∈ T and for every ω ∈ Ω, x(t, ω) ∈ Bt (ω, p);
EA3. For all t ∈ T , if y(t, ·) : Ω → Rl+ is F-measurable on Dom(E A ) with
y(t, ω) ∈ Bt (ω, p) for all ω ∈ Ω, then
Et [Ut (x(t, ·))|∆(p) ∩ Pt ](ω) ≥ Et [Ut (y(t, ·))|∆(p) ∩ Pt ](ω)
pointwise on Dom(∆(p) ∩ Pt );
EA4. For every ω ∈ Dom(E A ), t∈T x(t, ω) =

t∈T

e(t, ω).

The allocation x in E A is called an expectations equilibrium allocation in awareness for E A .
We denote by EA(E A ) the set of all the expectations equilibria of a pure
exchange economy E A , and denote by A(E A ) the set of all the expectations
equilibrium allocations in awareness for the economy.

3

The Results

Let E A be the economy with awareness structure and E A (ω) the economy with
complete information T, (e(t, ω))t∈T , (Ut (·, ω))t∈T for each ω ∈ Ω. We denote
by W(E A (ω)) the set of all competitive equilibria for E A (ω).
3.1

Existence of Equilibrium in Awareness

Theorem 1. Let E A be a pure exchange economy with awareness structure satisfying the conditions A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4. Then there exists an expectations
equilibrium in awareness for the economy; i.e., EA(E A ) = ∅.

Before proceeding with the proof we shall note that:
Lemma 1. The event (∆(p) ∩ Pt )(ω) can be decomposed into the disjoint union
(∆(p)∩Pt )(ω) = ∪pk=1 Π(ξk ). Furthermore, for x ∈ Ass(E A ), Et [Ut (x(t, ·))|∆(p)∩
p
πt (Π(ξk ))
Ut (x(t, ξk ), ξk ).
Pt ](ω) = k=1 πt ((∆(p)∩P
t )(ω))
Proof of Theorem 1. In view of the existence theorem of a competitive equilibrium for an economy with complete information,6 it follows that there exists a (p∗ (ω), x∗ (·, ω)) ∈ W(E A (ω)) for each ω ∈ Ω by the conditions A-1,
A-2, A-3 and A-4. Deﬁne the pair (p, x) as follows: For each ω ∈ Ω, denote x(t, ξ) := x∗ (t, ω) for all ξ ∈ Π(ω) and ω ∈ Dom(E A ), and set p(ξ) :=
/ Dom(E A ).
p∗ (ω) for all ξ ∈ Π(ω) and ω ∈ Dom(E A ), p(ξ) := p∗ (ω) for ω ∈
Then we can verify that (p, x) is an expectations equilibrium in awareness for
E A : For EA3. On noting that E A (ξ) = E A (ω) for any ξ ∈ Π(ω), it follows that
(p(ξ), x(t, ξ)) ∈ W(E A (ω)) for every ω ∈ Ω, and thus we can observe EA3 by
Lemma 1. The other conditions in Deﬁnition 3 are easily veriﬁed.
3.2

Fundamental Theorem for Welfare Economics

An allocation x in E A is said to be ex-ante Pareto-optimal if there is no allocation
a such that Et [Ut (a(t, ·))] ≥ Et [Ut (x(t, ·))] for all t ∈ T with at least one
inequality strict. We can now state our main theorem.
Theorem 2. Let E A be an economy with awareness structure satisfying the conditions A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4. An allocation is ex-ante Pareto optimal if and
only if it is an expectations equilibrium allocation in awareness for some initial endowment w with respect to some price system such that t∈T w(t, ω) =
A
t∈T e(t, ω) for each ω ∈ Dom(E ).
Proof. Follows immediately from Propositions 1 and 2 as below.
Proposition 1. Let E A be an economy with awareness structure satisfying the
conditions A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4. Then an allocation x is ex-ante Pareto
optimal if it is an expectations equilibrium allocation in awareness with respect
to some price system.
Proposition 2. Let E A be an economy with awareness structure satisfying the
conditions A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4. If an allocation x is ex-ante Pareto optimal in E A then there are a price system and an initial endowment e such that
x is an expectations equilibrium allocation in awareness with

Proof of Propositions 1 and 2

Before proving the propositions we ﬁrst establish
Proposition 3. Let E A be an economy with awareness structure satisfying the
conditions A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4. Then A(E A ) = {x ∈ Alc(E A ) | There is a
price system p such that (p(ω), x(·, ω)) ∈ W(E A (ω)) for all ω ∈ Dom(E A )}.
Proof. Let x ∈ A(E A ) and (p, x) ∈ EA(E A ). We shall show that (p(ω), x(·, ω)) ∈
W(E A (ω)) for any ω ∈ Dom(E A ). Suppose to the contrary that there exist a
trader s ∈ T and states ω ∈ Dom(E A ), ω0 ∈ (∆(p) ∩ Ps )(ω ) with the property:
There is an a(s, ω0 ) ∈ Bs (ω0 , p) such that Us (a(s, ω0 ), ω0 ) > Us (x(s, ω0 ), ω0 ).
Deﬁne the F-measurable function y : T × Ω → Rl+ by y(t, ξ) := a(t, ω0 ) for ξ ∈
Π(ω0 ), and y(t, ξ) := x(t, ξ) otherwise. It follows immediately by Lemma 1 that
Es [Us (x(s, ·))|∆(p) ∩ Ps ](ω ) < Es [Us (y(s, ·))|∆(p) ∩ Ps ](ω ), in contradiction.
The converse will be shown: Let x ∈ Ass(E A ) with (p(ω), x(·, ω)) ∈ W(E A (ω))
for any ω ∈ Dom(E A ). Set the price system p∗ : Ω → Rl+ by p∗ (ξ) := p(ω) for all
/ Dom(E A ). We shall
ξ ∈ Π(ω) and omega ∈ Dom(E A ), and p∗ (ξ) := p(ω) for ω ∈
∗
A
show that (p , x) ∈ EA(E ): x(t, ·) is F-measurable and x(t, ω) ∈ Bt (ω, p∗ ) on
Dom(E A ) for all t ∈ T . It can be plainly observed that EA1, EA2 and EA4
are all valid. For EA3: Let y(t, ·) : Ω → Rl+ be an F-measurable function with
y(t, ω) ∈ Bt (ω, p∗ ) for all ω ∈ Dom(E A ). Since (p∗ (ω), x(·, ω)) ∈ W(E A (ω)) it follows that Ut (x(t, ω), ω) ≥ Ut (y(t, ω), ω) for all t ∈ T and for each ω ∈ Dom(E A ).
By Lemma 1, Et [Ut (x(t, ·))|∆(p∗ ) ∩ Pt ](ω) ≥ Et [Ut (y(t, ·))|∆(p∗ ) ∩ Pt ](ω) for all
ω ∈ Dom(∆(p∗ ) ∩ Pt ), and so (p∗ , x) ∈ EA(E A ), in completing the proof.
Proof of Proposition 1. It follows from Proposition 3 that (p(ω), x(·, ω)) ∈
W(E A (ω)) at each ω ∈ Dom(E A ). By the fundamental theorem of welfare in
the economy E A (ω), we can plainly observe that for all ω ∈ Dom(E A ), x(·, ω) is
Pareto optimal in E A (ω), and thus x is ex-ante Pareto optimal.
Proof of Proposition 2. It can be shown that for each ω ∈ Ω there exists
p∗ (ω) ∈ Rl+ such that (p∗ (ω), x(·, ω)) ∈ W(E A (ω)) for some initial endowment
e (·, ω) with t∈T e (t, ω) = t∈T e(t, ω). Proof: First it can be observed that
for each ω ∈ Ω there exists p∗ (ω) ∈ Rl+ such that p∗ (ω) · v ≤ 0 for all v ∈
G(ω) = { t∈T x(t, ω) − t∈T y(t, ω) ∈ Rl | y ∈ Ass(E A ) and Ut (y(t, ω), ω) ≥
Ut (x(t, ω), ω) for all t ∈ T } for each ω ∈ Dom(E A ): In fact, on noting that that
G(ω) is convex and closed in Rl+ by the conditions A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4,
the assertion immediately follows from the fact that v ≤ 0 for all v ∈ G(ω)
by the separation theorem7 : Suppose to the contrary. Let ω0 ∈ Ω and v0 ∈
G(ω0 ) with v0 > 0. Take y0 ∈ Ass(E A ) such that for all t, Ut (y0 (t, ω), ω0 ) ≥
Ut (x(t, ω0 ), ω0 ) and v0 = t∈T x(t, ω0 ) − t∈T y0 (t, ω0 ). Let z ∈ Alc(E A ) be
v0
deﬁned by z(t, ξ) := y0 (t, ω0 ) + |T
| if ξ ∈ Π(ω0 ), z(t, ξ) := x(t, ξ) if not. By A-4

it follows that for all t ∈ T , Et [Ut (z)] ≥ Et [Ut (x)], in contradiction to which
x is ex-ante Pareto optimal. By a similar argument in the proof of the second
fundamental theorem of welfare economics,8 we can verify that (p∗ (ω), x(·, ω)) ∈
W(E A (ω)) for some initial endowment e with t∈T e (t, ω) = t∈T e(t, ω).
Now, let p be the price system deﬁned by: p(ξ) := p∗ (ω) for all ξ ∈ Π(ω) and
/ Dom(E A ). Further we extend e to the initial
ω ∈ Dom(E A ), p(ξ) := p∗ (ω) for ω ∈
A
endowment w for E by w(t, ξ) := e (t, ω) for all ξ ∈ Π(ω) and ω ∈ Dom(E A ). It
can be observed that w(t, ·) is F-measurable with t∈T w(t, ω) = t∈T e (t, ω).
To conclude the proof we shall show that (p, x) ∈ EA(E A ). Proof: For each
ω ∈ Dom(E A ), there exists ξ such that ξ ∈ (∆(p) ∩ Pt )(ω) = ∆(p)(ξ) = Π(ξ),
and so we can observe by A-3 that for each x ∈ Alc(E A ), Et [Ut (x(t, ·))|(∆(p) ∩
Pt )](ω) = Ut (x(t, ξ), ξ). We shall verify EA3 only: Suppose to the contrary
that there exists s ∈ T with the two properties: (i) there is an F-measurable
function y(s, ·) : Ω → Rl+ such that y(s, ω) ∈ Bs (ω, p) for all ω ∈ Ω; and
(ii) Es [Us (y(s, ·))|(∆(p) ∩ Ps )](ω0 ) > Es [Us (x(s, ·)|(∆(p) ∩ Ps )](ω0 ) for some
ω0 ∈ Dom(∆(p) ∩ Ps ). In view of the above equation it follows from (ii) that
there exists ξ ∈ (∆(p) ∩ Pt )(ω0 ) with Us (y(s, ξ), ξ) > Us (x(s, ξ), ξ), and thus
y(s, ξ) > x(s, ξ) by A-4. Thus p(ξ) · y(s, ξ) > p(ξ) · x(s, ξ), in contradiction.

Concluding Remarks

Our real concern in this article is about relationship between players’ beliefs
and their decision making, especially when and how the players take corporate
actions under their decisions. We focus on extending the fundamental theorem
of welfare economics into an economy with traders having ‘awareness and belief’
model. We have shown that the nature of the theorem is dependent not on
common-belief nor on the partition structure of traders’ information, but on the
structure of awareness and belief when each player receives information.
