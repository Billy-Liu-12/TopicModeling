Abstract
High-dimensional multivariate integration is a diﬃcult problem for which the
Monte Carlo method is often the only viable approach. This method provides an
unbiased estimator of the integral, together with a probabilistic error estimate
(e.g., in the form of a conﬁdence interval). The aim of randomized quasi-Monte
Carlo (QMC) methods is to provide lower-variance unbiased estimators, also
with error estimates. This talk will concentrate on one class of randomized QMC
methods: randomized lattice rules.
We will explain how these methods ﬁt into QMC methods in general and
why they are interesting, how to choose their parameters, and how they can be
used for medium and large-scale simulations. Numerical examples will be given
to illustrate their eﬀectiveness.
