Abstract. Algorithms based on reflectance band ratios and first derivative have
been developed for the estimation of chlorophyll a and carotenoid content of rice
leaves by using airborne hyperspectral data acquainted by Pushbroom
Hyperspectral Imager (PHI). There was a strong R680/R825 and chlorophyll a
relationship with a linear relationship between the ratio of reflectance at 680nm
and 825nm. The first derivative at 686 nm and 601 nm correlated best with
carotenoid. The relationship between the ratio of R680/R825 and chlorophyll a
relationship, the first derivative at 686 nm and carotenoid concentration were
used to develop predictive regression equations for the estimation of canopy
chlorophyll a and carotenoid concentration respectively. The relationship was
applied to the imagery, where a chlorophyll a concentration map was generated
in XueBu, which is one of the sites for rice.

1 Introduction
Hyperspectral remote sensing exploits the fact that all material reflect, absorb, and emit
electromagnetic energy, at specific wavelengths, in distinctive patterns related to their
molecular composition. Hyperspectral imaging sensors in the reflective regions of the
spectrum acquire digital images in many contiguous and very narrow spectral bands
that typically span the visible, near infrared, and mid-infrared portions of the spectrum.
This enables the construction of an essentially continuous radiance spectrum for every
pixel in the scene. Thus, Hyperspectral imaging data exploitation makes possible the
remote identification of ground materials-of –interest based on their spectral signatures.
(D.G.Manolakis & G.Shaw, 2002)
Hyperspectral algorithms for the estimation of the concentrations of chlorophyll A
and carotenoids can be develop using statistical approaches. Spectral band in the visible
and near-infrared regions of the spectrum have been used to develop a number of
indices for estimating chlorophyll. The commonly used normalized difference
vegetation index (NDVI) was developed by contrasting the chlorophyll absorption in
the red wavelengths. The NDVI has been found to be insensitive to medium and high

chlorophyll concentrations.(Buschman & Nagel,1993) Miller found the concentration
of chlorophyll within a vegetation canopy is related positively to the point of maximum
slope at wavelengths between 690 and 740 nm in reflectance.(Miller et al.,1990) This
point, Known as the Red edge of plant reflectance.(Curran et al.,1991) The Recent
studies have developed several new vegetation indices based on other visible
wavelength bands instead of the red wavelengths near 670-680nm.The spectral
derivative technique has been used to improve characterizing the spectra and estimating
accuracy of vegetation biochemical concentrations (Demerriades-Shah & Steven.M.D.
et al., 1990, Pu & Gong 1997). Maximum sensitivity of reflectance to chlorophyll
content was found in the green wavelengths region at 550 nm and at 708 nm in the
far-red wavelengths. The reflectance in the main chlorophyll absorption regions in
400-500nm and 660-690nm proved to be insensitive to variation in chlorophyll content
(Bisun.D.,1998). Strong correlation were observed between red edge position and
canopy chlorophyll concentration using airborne image (Rosemary.A.J. et al.,1999).

2 Data Acquisition
2.1 Airborne Radiance Data
The hyperspectral image data in this paper are acquired from two airborne flights in
1999 in Changzhou area, Jiangsu province of East China, by using the Push-broom
Hyperspectral Imager (PHI), which is developed by the Shanghai Institute of Technical
Physics (SITP), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Table 1 shows the specification
of PHI. The flights were carried out in September 9 and October 18 when the rice was
in the broom and ripe stages, respectively. 80 bands were selected for recording in a
range of 400-850nm for the 244-band PHI with the spectral resolution <5nm. The pixel
size or spatial resolution is 2.25m with a flight altitude about 1500m. A 3D stabilized
platform was applied for PHI and GPS data was recorded with the image data.

The field spectra are measured by the 252-channel SE590 spectrometer with a
spectral resolution about 2-3nm in the range of 0.4-1.1µm.
The PHI image was pre-processed for radiometric, spectral and geometric
calibration then was transformed to a reflectance image by field calibration using
empirical line method.
2.2 Field Site
Night field sites were selected to analyzed chlorophyll concentration. There are four
sites for rice within the nine. Unfortunately the PHI imagery was acquired on 18
October 1999 was deflected one field site for rice. Three sites were used to analyze rice
samples. Nine study plot were located three sites which to be ensure were larger than
one 2.25m*2.25m PHI pixel. Field reflectance and samples of different rice species for
biochemical analyses were collected at the nine study areas.
2.3 Canopy Biochemical Concentration Data
Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid of rice leaves have been measured in
Sep.1 1999 and Oct.18, 1999 in the study area of Changzhou.
The concentration of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and total chlorophyll was
calculated by the following equations. The unit is microgram per milliliter.
Ca=12.7A663-2.69A645

(1)

Cb=22.9A645-4.68A663

(2)

Ca+b=20.2A645+8.02A663
CK =4.7A440-0.27CA+B

(3)
(4)

Where Ca is the concentration of chlorophyll a; Cb is the concentration of chlorophyll b,
Ca+b is the concentration of the total chlorophyll and CK is the concentration of
carotenoid (mg/ml) A663 and A645 are the absorption value of leaves where wavelengths
are 663nm and 645nm respectively. These values were measured by 721
spectrophotometer.
From the Ca, Cb, and Ca+b, the concentration of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and
carotenoid can be got from the following equations.
Xa = Ca×V/W

(5)

Xb= Cb×V/W

(6)

X = Ca+b×V/W

(7)

Y = (4.7A440 – 0.27Ca+b) ×V/W

(8)

Where Xa, Xb, X, and Y are the concentration of the chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b,
chlorophyll a and b, and carotenoid respectively. (mg/g). And A440 is the absorption
value of the leaf where wavelength equals 440 nm. W (g) is the weight of the samples
and V (ml) is the volume of the sample liquor.

concentrations of carotenoid at all wavelengths

showing the correlation coefficients between reflectance, first derivative of reflectance
and the concentrations of vegetation biochemical at all wavelengths. The correlogram
for chlorophyll is shown in Figure 1. The similar correlogram for cartooned is
demonstrated in Figure 2. The reflectance is insensitive to chlorophyll. The first
derivative at 735 nm correlated best with chlorophyll. The reflectance and the first
derivative were well correlated with the carotenoid contents at many wavelength bands.
The first derivative at 601 nm and 686 nm correlated best with carotenoid.
Chlorophyll a, b, a+b, and carotenoid content were related to the vegetation indices
R680/R550, R680/R700, R680/R825, R760/R550, R760/R700, R825/R550, NDVI,
GNDVI, the Red edge Position and the Red edge slope. The correlation coefficients
between these indices and pigment are given in Table 2.
The NDVI is normalized difference vegetation index, defined as
(R760-R670)/(R760+R670).
A “green” NDVI defined as GNDVI=(R760-R550)/(R760+R550),by using the
green wavelength band near 550nm.
Red edge position is the point of maximum slope at wavelengths between 690 nm
and 740 nm in reflectance. This point characterizes the effective boundary between the
strong absorption of red radiation by chlorophyll and the increased multiple scattering
of radiation in near-infrared wavelengths (Curran et al., 1991).
Red edge slope is the slope of red edge and is the maximum slope at wavelength
between 690 nm and 740 nm.
R680/R550, R680/R700, R680/R825 and R825/R550 are sensitive to chlorophyll a,
and R680/R825 is correlated best with chlorophyll a.
R680/R825 and R825/R550 are well correlated with chlorophyll a+b. The red edge
slope is sensitive to carotenoid.

4 Algorithms for Estimates of Canopy Chlorophyll and Carotenoid
from Image Spectra
There was a strong R680/R825 – chlorophyll a relationship with a linear relationship
between the ratio of reflectance at 680nm and 825nm.. There was a statistically
significant correlation between R680/R825 and chlorophyll a at the 99% confidence
level.(r = -0.90)
The relationship between R680/R825 and chlorophyll a concentration was used to
develop a predictive regression equation for the estimation of canopy chlorophyll a
concentration. The algorithms equation had the form of Equation (9).
Chl a = -2.657R680/R825+1.8029

(9)

Where Chl a is the concentration of chlorophyll a (mg/g). R680 and R825 are the
reflectance at 680nm and 825nm.
This relationship was applied to the imagery, where a chlorophyll a concentration
map (Figure 3) was generated in Xuebu, which is one of the sites for rice.
The first derivative at 686 nm correlated best with. There was a very strong first
derivative-carotenoid relationship with a linear relationship between the first derivative
at 686nm. There was a statistically significant correlation between the first derivative at
686 nm and carotenoid at the 99.9% confidence level. (r = 0.99)
The relationship between the first derivative at 686 nm and carotenoid concentration
was used to develop a predictive regression equation for the estimation of canopy
carotenoid concentration. The algorithm equation was the Equation (10).

5 Discussion
Analysis of visible/infrared reflectance and biochemical concentration data for rice
leaves has revealed some new information on the quantification of chlorophyll and
carotenoid by airborne hyperspectral data. PHI data, by means of its continuous, high
resolution spectral imagine, have been found useful for the estimation of chlorophyll a
and carotenoid content of rice leaves. It was found that the indices R680/R550,
R680/R700, R680/R825 and R825/R550 correlate well with chlorophyll a. R680/R825
and R825/R550 showed the more sensitivity to chlorophyll a+b. It was also found red
edge slope correlate well with carotenoid. The new index R680/R825 is the best
indicator of chlorophyll a. The reflectance ratio is the simple transformation, which
removes irrelevant information from reflectance spectra, and highlights subtle
variations in reflectance cause by chemical absorptions (B.Datt, 1999). The R680/R825
is calculated from wavelengths that is not affected by leaf structure (M.L.Adams,
W.D.Philpot and W.A.Norvell, 1999), and also be unaffected by leaf water content
(Bowman, W.D.1989).
The reflectance and the first derivative of reflectance at many wavelengths are more
sensitive to the carotenoid content of rice leaves. The phase of the airborne
hyperspectral data acquisition is October 18, which is complete maturity period of rice.
The rice color is yellow and the carotenoid content is more than the others growth
stages of rice.
The algorithms devolved in this paper have been found to accurately predict the
chlorophyll and carotenoid content in rice leave in maturity period. They are needed to
be compared with more data sets. The applicability to the other growth stages and other
crops will need to be evaluated by further experiments.
The employed ground-truth was found to be limited due to some constrains. Despite
these limitations however, optimistic chlorophyll and carotenoid content of rice for the
PHI was clearly established.
