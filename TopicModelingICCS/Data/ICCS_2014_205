Abstract
In this paper, a new macro assets price index (MAPI) is constructed based on support vector
machine. In fact, 12 indicators, which can represent the macro economy well in both economically and statistically, are chosen to build our new index. Here, diﬀerent from traditional
econometric method, a novel machine learning method support vector regression machine (SVR)
is employed to product the predictor of consumer price index (CPI) in China. In addition, in
the experiment part, we also compare the result of SVR with that of least square regression
(LSR) and vector autoregressive (VAR) impulse response analysis. The comparison shows that
the latter two methods are hard to satisfy the requirement in both economically and statistically. On the contrary, SVR gives a good predictor of CPI and exhibits a manifest leading of
CPI. In other words, our index can forecast the trends by 4 to 6 months, which is useful for
investment and policy making.

Introduction

In the last twenty years, the research of ﬁnancial conditions index (FCI), which can show
the ﬁnancial condition, has received more and more attention. FCI derived from Monetary
Conditions Index (MCI), which was studied and constructed by Bank of Canada (BOC) in
1990s. This concept was ﬁrstly posed by Freedman (1994) [5], which pointed out that some
variables representing monetary conditions were very important to monetary policy making.
After the emergence of MCI, Goodhart and Hofmann (2001) [7] noticed the important role
that asset price played in monetary policy conduction. For example, the change of stock price

and real estate price inﬂuenced the demand of money obviously. Consequently, we could build
composite index to represent ﬁnancial conditions. Two important steps in the construction of
FCI are feature selection and weight determining. Diﬀerent ways of dealing with this two steps
produce diﬀerent FCIs. Mayes (2001) [10] constructed the FCI of 11 European countries by
IS curve function. English et al. (2005) [4] tested the ability of macro economy prediction of
diverse ﬁnancial variables. Then, using Stock-Watson model, they built the FCI of Germany,
UK and US, basing on factor analysis. Also, there are many other diﬀerent methods of FCI
construction [6][1]. However, the econometric methods of FCI construction neglect the nonlinear
relationship between the input and output variables, which doesn’t agree with the reality. In
fact, the relationship among the economic indicators changes over time [8][7].
Actually, in machine learning, the construction of FCI can be treated as a standard regression
problem. As we have explained above, traditional econometric methods are not suitable for this
kind of regression, because of strong assumptions they need. To overcome this ﬂaw, support
vector regression (SVR) is employed in this paper. SVR is derived from support vector machine
(SVM), which is ﬁrstly studied by Vapnik (1998, 2000) [15][16]. Based on the principle of the
structural risk minimization, SVM algorithm focuses on not only empirical risk minimization,
but also the VC dimension of the function. This principle promises a good generalization
ability of SVM, and shows a widely application. In SVM, regression problem is changed into
a classiﬁcation problem. Kernel technique makes SVM suitable for many nonlinear problem in
reality [2][3]. As a result, SVR can be applied for forecasting. For some economical and ﬁnancial
time series dealing problems, comparing with other econometric methods, it promises to yield
a quite reliable prediction [9]. In addition, among many diﬀerent machine learning methods,
SVR also provides a competitive result. Trafalis et al. (2004) [14] studied the results of using
diﬀerent machine learning methods to forecast stock prices. The regression result showed that
SVR is much more suitable for this kind of ﬁnancial time series analysis than Back propagation
and RBF networks. The research of Wang et al. (2012) [17] showed SVR was suitable for
constructing FCI in China.
This paper proposes a brand new method to construct FCI, which is named as Macro Asset
Price Index (MAPI), by taking advantage of SVR. In addition, we compare the result of SVR
with other diﬀerent econometric models, to show the advantage of SVR in dealing with this
kind of economical problem. The following of this paper is organized as follows. Details of
SVM is introduced in Section 2. Section 3 shows the feature selection and lag time choosing
process of our problem, as well as the result of diﬀerent methods. We will conclude our work
and conceive future work in Section 4.

Support Vector Machine

Basing on the research of convex quadratic programming, SVM algorithm takes a great development recently. Furthermore, taking advantage of kernel technique, we can apply SVM in
many complicated real-life problem with small data set [2][3][12]. Mostly, it can be used to deal
with classiﬁcation problem and regression problem, which are called SVC and SVR respectively.
Next, we will introduce these models.

2.1

Support Vector Classiﬁcation Machine

Considering a typical binary classiﬁcation problem, we can describe it as follows.
x1 , y1 ), (x
x2 , y2 ), · · · , (x
xl , yl )} ∈ X × Y . Here,
Suppose that there is a training set T = {(x
xi ∈ X = Rn , yi ∈ Y = {1, −1}. The algorithm tries to ﬁnd a real function g(x) on X = Rn .

Then, the decision function can be constructed as follows:
x)).
x) = sgn(g(x
f (x
In this case, we can tell the class y of every single pattern x. Here, sgn(·) can be deﬁned as
follows:
1,
a 0;
sgn(a) =
−1, a < 0.
A two dimension case can be shown in Figure 1. In the ﬁgure, the symbols ”+” and ”-”

Figure 1: A linear separable case
represent two diﬀerent classes respectively, i.e. ”1” and ”-1”. Then, the lines represent diﬀerent
hyperplanes which are obtained by the algorithm. Each hyperplane separates the input space
into two diﬀerent parts. Then, the points distributing on diﬀerent sides of the hyperplane
belong to diﬀerent classes.
Furthermore, we give the original problem and dual problem of soft margin SVC.

Macro Assets Price Index

In this section, we apply SVR to macro assets price index construction. Actually, the purpose
of constructing macro assets price index is to describe the overall macro assets price conditions.
Noting that CPI is an important index of macro economy circumstance by measuring the
prices of some certain goods and service. As a result, we choose CPI as the target. Then,
regression between some ﬁnancial indicators and nonﬁnancial indicators is executed. Finally,
after comparing with other econometric methods, SVR is chosen for our regression problem.
Here, we display all the tables in appendix A.

3.1

Flowchart of the Construction of Macro Index

In our problem, we have ﬁve important steps of constructing the ﬁnal index. The ﬁrst step is to
select the original indicators (independent variable). Then, we need to select the time interval
and collect the data. In the second step, preprocessing the data and ﬁltering the features are
1804

Support Vector Machine Based Macro Assets Price Index

Liu, Sun, Han and Wang

needed. Next, in the third step, because the data of ﬁnancial indicators are often time series, we
need to ﬁx the lag time of each indicator by the accordance between the regression results and
the signiﬁcation in economy. In the fourth step, we compare the results of other diﬀerent models
and methods, to show the eﬀectiveness of SVR in our problem. In the last step, construct the
index by using the selected indicators with certain lag times.
The following Figure 2 shows the ﬂowchart of the construction of macro index.

Figure 2: Flowchart of the construction of macro index

3.2

Original Indicators Selection

Based on the meaning of indicators in economy, we mainly choose indicators in three diﬀerent
but related ﬁelds, i.e. ﬁnancial market, nonﬁnancial market and social investigation. Particularly, in the ﬁnancial market, we choose China interbank oﬀered rate (CHIBOR), Interbank
collateral repo rate (IBCRR), RMB real eﬀective exchange rate index (RMB-REER), RMB
exchange rate against dollar (RMB-ERAD), Shanghai and Shenzhen 300 index (SHSE300),
Shanghai Composite Index (SCI), Shanghai composite index of treasury bonds (SCITB), SSE
fund index (SSEF), AU9995, AU9999, The dollar index (DI) and so on. In the nonﬁnancial
market, we choose Purchase price index of industrial production (PPIIP), Producer price index
of industrial (PPII), Producer price index of agricultural (PPIA), Price index of agricultural
means of production (AMPI), Total corporate goods price index (CGPI), Retail price index
(RPI), Price index for investment in ﬁxed assets (FAPI) and so on. In social investigation,
we choose Consumer conﬁdence index (CCI), Entrepreneurs conﬁdence index (ECI), Business
climate index (BCI), Banker conﬁdence index (BACI), Loan demand index (LDI) and so on.
Table 1 shows all the original indicators chosen in our method. The frequency of all the
data, including CPI (year-on-year), is monthly. Some indicators with quarterly data have been
interpolated into monthly data. The data period of the data is from January, 2006 to December,
2011 (72 months). Then, we do seasonal adjustment to the smoothed data.

3.3

Correlation Analysis

Firstly, in time series analysis, non-stationary data is often processed into stationary data. As
a result, in our problem, we compare the eﬀects between this two diﬀerent kinds of data by
1805

Support Vector Machine Based Macro Assets Price Index

Liu, Sun, Han and Wang

using SVR with linear kernel. The reason of the kernel choosing is we need to ﬁnd the exact
relationship between the indicators and CPI, which is clearer by using linear kernel than any
other kernel. Another reason is that we can select indicators through the coeﬃcients directly,
according to the relationship between the indicators and CPI in economy. The SVR result
shows that stationary data doesn’t guarantee better result. To the contrary, the original data
yields better result in this problem. Therefore, we keep the experiment data the same as the
original one.
Next, we analyze the correlation between every indicator and CPI by calculating the correlation coeﬃcients and maximum information coeﬃcient (MIC) between them. Here, MIC is a
kind of method to help ﬁnding the linear and nonlinear correlation between two variables, which
was ﬁrstly proposed by Reshef et al. (2011) [11]. The value of MIC is between 0 and 1. The
value 0 shows the weakest correlation between two variables. The value 1 shows the strongest
correlation between two variables. We remove the indicator that shows weak correlation in both
in correlation coeﬃcients and MIC.

3.4

Lag Time and Feature Selection

After correlation analysis, we remove SCI, AU9999 and AU9995 for the following steps. Furthermore, existing data mining models cannot deal with high dimension well, so more features
need to be cut. By virtue of traditional Econometrics method, we remove the indicators with
weak prediction power or collinearity to each other. In other words, the indicators with strong
prediction power to CPI and independence are kept as well.
On the other hand, taking advantage of lag time method and economic meaning, we remove
the indicators that are not suitable for our experiment. In fact, the lag time will inﬂuence the
relationship among the indicators in the following aspects.
Psychological Expecting Factor The main body of economic activity is human being.
Psychological reasons make people have some time delay in reacting to the changes of economic
condition and economic environment, namely, the lag of decision making. For example, the
consumption amount of certain commodity is interrelated to not only the current price of this
certain commodity, but also the price in the future people expecting.
Technique Factor In the operation of national economy, from production to currency, and
then, to consumption, time lag is inevitable. This kind of situation is very easy to understand,
because of the time every single economic link taking.
The Inﬂuence of Asset Price Transmission Channel in Monetary Policy Monetary
policy is a set of measures that the government or central bank takes in order to inﬂuence or
control the economic activity. In this way, the government can achieve certain economic goals,
such restraining the inﬂation, maintaining the economic growth and increasing employment
rate. The monetary policy determines money supply in some degree, which is the beginning
of currency. The theoretical basis of asset price transmission mechanism are the q theory of
investment and the wealth eﬀect theory [13]. On one hand, Tobin’s q theory deﬁnes a function
q, which is the ratio between vendibility of company asset and capital replacement cost. The
transmission mechanism of q theory is as follows:
money supply ↑ → price of interest rate and stock ↑
→ q ↑→ investment ↑→ output − input ratio ↑
1806

(6)

Support Vector Machine Based Macro Assets Price Index

Liu, Sun, Han and Wang

On the other hand, Modigliani’s wealth eﬀect theory says that consumer expenditure is determined by the consumer’s life estate. The transmission mechanism of wealth eﬀect theory is as
follows:
money supply ↑→ interest rate ↑ → the price of stock ↑
(7)
→ wealth ↑→ consumption ↑→ output − input ratio ↑
The theories introduced above indicate that the ﬂuctuation ﬁnancial indicators will eﬀect inﬂation, and is ahead of the ﬂuctuation of nonﬁnancial indicators. As a result, the choosing of
lag time is important in the research of asset price.

3.5

The Choosing of Lag Time

In our experiment, considering the eﬀect of time lag adequately, we need to ﬁx the lag time
of every single indicator, which is important to make sure our model can reﬂect economic
phenomenon objectively. There are three diﬀerent steps in our experiment by which we can ﬁx
the lag time of every selected indicator.
3.5.1

All the indicators with the same lag time

In the ﬁrst round, we keep all the indicators with the same lag time, i.e. lag 1, lag 3. The
following tables show the whole process.
As we can see in Table 2, the regression coeﬃcients of marked indicators, IBCRR, AU9999
and AU9995, don’t consist with the correlation analysis result, although they are stable with
diﬀerent parameters. The marked indicator DI is sensitive with data and parameter. Besides,
the marked indicator SCI is not stable when the lag time changes. In addition, the correlation
between gold products and China ﬁnancial market is weak. At the same time, the correlation
between SCI and HS300 is strong. As a result, in the round, we remove the indicators marked
in bold, which are IBCRR, AU9999, AU9995, SCI, RMB-ERAD and DI.
In the second round, we still keep all the indicators with the same lag time, i.e. lag 1, lag 3
and lag 4.
In Table 3, the marked indicator RPI is not stable with diverse parameters of the same lag
time. Meanwhile, RPI has a strong correlation with CGPI. The marked indicator BACI has a
negative correlation with CPI, which conﬂicts with the real economic meaning. As a result, we
remove RPI and BACI in our following experiment.
According to Table 4 and economic meaning, we remove eight diﬀerent indicators, including
IBCRR, RMB-ERAD, SCI, AU9999, AU9995, DI, RPI and BACI.
3.5.2

Financial and nonﬁnancial indicators with diﬀerent lag times

As we all know, ﬁnancial market is mostly ahead of economic market. As a result, the ﬁnancial
indicators will play a role of early warning to the development of economy, which leads us to
choose ﬁnancial and nonﬁnancial indicators with diﬀerent lag times.
According to the former study, the ﬁnancial indicator is usually ahead of the nonﬁnancial
indicator with 4 to 6 lag time. Consequently, in this round, we choose 4 to 6 lag time for the
ﬁnancial indicators, 1 to 3 lag time for the nonﬁnancial indicators.
In this round, basing on the result of SVR on diﬀerent lag times data, we can ﬁx most of
the indicators’ lag time, such as HS300 (lag 4), SSEF (lag 4), CCI (lag 1) and PPIA (lag 3),
excepting CHIBOR and SCITB. For CHIBOR and SCITB, the regression coeﬃcient in this
round is negative, which is not consistent with real economic analysis. As a result, we test
1807

Support Vector Machine Based Macro Assets Price Index

Liu, Sun, Han and Wang

diﬀerent lag time (lag 1, lag 2, lag 3) in the following fourth round. The result of this round is
in Table 5
As we can see in Table 5, CHIBOR (Lag 3) and SCITB (Lag 3) are more eﬀective than
other lag times. At the same time, according to the regression coeﬃcient of SVR, LDI, PPII
and PPIIP have negative correlations with CPI, which doesn’t agree with economic analysis.
Therefore, we remove these three indicators in our following experiment.
Finally, the rest 12 indicators (with lag time) are used to construct our macro assets price
index (MAPI). The result of SVR is displayed in Tabel 6.

3.6

Methods Comparison and Results

In this section, at ﬁrst, we apply least square regression (LSR) and vector autoregression (VAR)
impulse response to our data. Then, compare the results of diﬀerent methods. At last, the
overall result of SVR is displayed in
3.6.1

Methods results comparison

Least square regression First of all, feature selection and lag time choosing are inevitable,
no matter what method is applied. Here, least square regression is used for feature selection
and lag time choosing. As we can see, in Table 7, the coeﬃcient is sensitive to diﬀerent lag
times and not stable to any lag time choice. As a result, LSR is not suitable to our data in this
experiment.
Vector autoregression impulse response As we all know, the requirement of VAR impulse
response is strict to the data. Particularly, same order stationary data is needed. According
to the test result, some of the indicators don’t accord with this requirement. There are only
9 indicators satisfy with one order stationary condition at last. However, there are more than
half of the 9 indicators cannot converge at time 20, which means VAR impulse response method
is not suitable to our data. Moreover, the result of VAR doesn’t accord with economic meaning
and with weak prediction eﬀect. Figure 3 shows the result of VAR impulse response. In the
ﬁgure, all the indicators are one order stationary sequence. Concretely, these indicators are
CHIBOR, HS300, SSEF, CGPI, PPII, PPIIP, AMPI, PPIA and BCI, respectively.
Support vector regression Table 6 shows that we can obtain a more reasonable and reliable
result by applying SVR to our data. Particularly, according to the weight coeﬃcient in Table 6,
there are some conclusion we can make, which are list in the following.
(1) The sign of every indicator’s coeﬃcient agrees with the economic implication.
In particular, RMB-REER and CHIBOR have negative correlations to CPI, while the rest
indicators all have a positive anticipation to the future inﬂation.
(2) Generally speaking, the value of price indicators’ coeﬃcients agree with the
study of most scholars. For example, considering the current ﬁnancial market in China, the
conduction eﬀect of interest rate, treasury bond and fund to economy is weaker than that of
stock and exchange rate. Among these indicators, because of the largest proportion of stock
market in asset market, stock has a major inﬂuence on the macro economy, which has been
reﬂected by the relatively large value of its regression coeﬃcient. In the nonﬁnancial market,
because of the largest proportion of investment in the economy increase in China, especially the
large proportion of ﬁxed asset investment, the value of FAPI’s coeﬃcient is relatively larger.
(3) The coeﬃcients of social survey indicators, such as ECI and BCI, are larger

Figure 3: The result of VAR impulse response
than others. There are two possibilities of this situation. One is subjective anticipation has
a comparatively large inﬂuence on China’s economy. The other one is the interpolation has an
impact on the regression result.
Macro index construction Here, we show the graph of our macro asset price index (MAPI)
which is constructed by SVR. Figure 4 shows that our MAPI climaxes in the year of 2007, then,
it begins to drop, which reaches the bottom in the end of 2008. Later, MAPI increases, with
little ﬂuctuation during 2009 to 2011, which can reﬂect the world’s economy situation around
the year of 2008. Meanwhile, MAPI has a similar trend with CPI, leading CPI with 4 to 6
months. Particularly, in the wave crest, MAPI leading CPI with about 4 months, in the trough
of wave, MAPI leading CPI with about 6 months.
The leading characteristic of our index to CPI can provide a reference to economy policy
decision makers and also help the investor to construct a intuitive anticipation to the trend of
macro economy. Figure 4 shows the trends of our MAPI and CPI. As two vertical lines indicate,
MAPI behaves a leading characteristic to CPI by 4 to 6 months. Furthermore, we display the
trends of MAPI and macro prosperity consistent index (MPCI) in Figure 5, which shows MAPI
has a similar trend with MPCI, leading with a conspicuous period.

Conclusion and Future Work

This paper proposes a brand new method of FCI construction, which is based on machine
learning algorithm SVR. The work in this paper can be divided into two diﬀerent part. The
ﬁrst one is feature selection. In this part, we choose 23 original indicators from ﬁnancial market,
nonﬁnancial market and social investigation. Considering the inﬂuence of lag time, we try to

ﬁnd the most signiﬁcant lag time of each indicator, which can product a promising result and
make sense in economy. After 5 rounds of wrapped feature selection, according to economical
meaning of every single indicator, 12 indicators with certain lag time are involved in the ﬁnal
regression. Then, in the second part, taking advantage of SVR, we can obtain the weight
vector of the indicators and build MAPI. Here, linear SVR is chosen, because we need to ﬁnd
the relationship between each indicator and CPI clearly. Intuitively, it can be reﬂected in the
sign and value of each weight.
In addition, a comparison of diﬀerent methods shows that SVR is more suitable for our
problem than other econometric methods, such as LSR and VAR. Furthermore, our MAPI
shows a good leading characteristic to CPI with 4 to 6 months. In the analysis of macro
economy, MAPI has a good value for asset investment and macro economy policy making.
For the future work, we suggest to release our new index MAPI quarterly. As a result,
weight vector of indicators should be adjust by SVR on new macro data. Also, diﬀerent kernel
functions can be used to our problem in order to ﬁnd the best regression result.
