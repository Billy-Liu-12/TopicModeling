Abstract
A central issue in biological data analysis is that uncertainty, resulting from diﬀerent factors
of variability, may change the eﬀect of the events being investigated. Therefore, robustness is
a fundamental step to be considered. Robustness refers to the ability of a process to cope well
with uncertainties, but the diﬀerent ways to model both the processes and the uncertainties
lead to many alternative conclusions in the robustness analysis.
In this paper we apply a framework allowing to deal with such questions for mass spectrometry
data. Speciﬁcally, we provide robust decisions when testing hypothesis over a case/control
population of subject measurements (i.e. proteomic proﬁles). To this concern, we formulate
(i) a reference model for the observed data (i.e., graphs), (ii) a reference method to provide
decisions (i.e., test of hypotheses over graph properties) and (iii) a reference model of variability
to employ sources of uncertainties (i.e., random graphs). We apply these models to a realcase study, analyzing the mass spectrometry proﬁles of the most common type of Renal Cell
Carcinoma; the Clear Cell variant.
Keywords: Data analysis, inference, robust decisions, graph, mass spectrometry.

Introduction

Uncertainty characterizes many experimental processes and may change the eﬀects of the events
being investigated. For this reason, robustness analysis needs to be considered in an appropriate
manner1 . Even though, in its general form, the word robustness refers to the ability of a process
to cope well with uncertainties, the diﬀerent ways in which both the process and the uncertainty
are modeled may lead to many alternative deﬁnitions of the word itself. Hampel [9] deﬁnes the
word robustness within a general statistical context. That deﬁnition can be summarized by
considering the robustness as the stability theory of statistical procedures. It systematically investigates the eﬀects of deviations from modeling assumptions on known procedures and, if
necessary, develops new, better procedures. Recently, the relationship between robustness and

multiple criteria decision analysis has been observed by a number of researchers [18, 15]. For
instance Kouvelis and Yu [13] studied the robustness in the context of discrete optimization.
They provide theoretical results and algorithms for determining the solution that exhibits the
best worst case deviation (or percentage deviation) from optimality, among all feasible decisions
over all realizable input data scenarios.
In this paper we deal with such questions for mass spectrometry data. In this context
data produced by mass spectrometers are aﬀected by errors and noise due to sample preparation and instrument approximation, therefore data pre-processing and robust data analysis are
fundamentals. Here, we provide robust decisions when testing hypothesis over a case/control
population of subject measurements i.e. proteomic proﬁles. For our purposes protein/peptide
proﬁles can be thought of as collections of peaks, where each peak identiﬁes the pair of values
given by the intensity (related to the abundance) of a molecule with its speciﬁc molecular massto-charge ratio. To this concern, we properly formulate (i) a reference model of the observed
data (i.e., graphs), (ii) a reference method to provide decisions (i.e., test of hypotheses over
graph properties) and (iii) a reference model of variability to employ sources of uncertainties
(i.e., random graphs). Throughout, we apply a real-case study by analyzing the mass spectrometry proﬁles of the most common type of Renal Cell Carcinoma: the Clear Cell variant
(ccRCC) 2 . In Sec. 2 we introduce basic deﬁnitions and preliminary notations. In Sec. 3 we
formulate the reference model for the observed data, the reference method to provide decisions
and the reference model of variability. Sec. 4 is speciﬁcally dedicated to our case study (i.e.
RCC analysis). In Sec. 5 we report results and numerical details of the statistical procedures
applied to the RCC data. Finally we conclude the work in Sec. 6 by providing discussions for
future analysis.

Basic Deﬁnitions

Throughout this paper G = (V1 ∪ V2 , E) denotes a bipartite graph. V1 and V2 are two totally
ordered sets of vertices 3 such that the set of edges E ⊆ V1 × V2 connect vertices in one set with
vertices in the other: i.e., E is a set of pairs (vi , vj ) with vi ∈ V1 and vj ∈ V2 . Given a bipartite
˜ = (A,
˜ E),
˜ with A˜ ⊆ V1 ∪ V2 and E
˜⊆E
graph G = (V1 ∪ V2 , E), the sub-graph of G given by G
4
˜
˜
˜
is a biclique if, for all v1 ∈ (A ∩ V1 ) and v2 ∈ (A ∩ V2 ) then (v1 , v2 ) ∈ E . The number of
vertices Nv = |V1 ∪ V2 | and the number of edges Ne = |E| are generally called the order and
the size of the graph. Graphs can be generally “summarized” in a compact way by various
graph properties. Among all the properties in the literature [4], here we focus on cohesion. A
well known index to characterize this notion is that of density. Before introducing formally this
concept we give the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 1 (Neighborhood). Let G = (V1 ∪ V2 , E) be a bipartite graph. We call Mi,j,k (G) =
˜ E)
˜ a (i, j, k)−neighborhood (or simply, a neighborhood Mi,j,k centered in (vi , vj )) the sub(A,
graphs of G induced by A˜ = V˜i,k ∪ V˜j,k where V˜i,k = {vi−k , . . . , vi , . . . , vi+k } ⊆ V1 , V˜j,k =
{vj−k , . . . , vj , . . . , vj+k } ⊆ V2 5 .
2 Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) is typically asymptomatic and surgery usually increases patients life only for
early stage tumors. However, some cystic and solid renal lesions cannot be conﬁdently diﬀerentiated from clear
cell RCC. Therefore early detection of robust markers to distinguish malignant kidney tumors is needed. See
for instance [5].
3 This requirement is motivated by the necessity to employ new deﬁnitions.
4 Bicliques are therefore “extreme” forms of highly inter-connected bipartite graphs.
5 We also refer to the pair (v , v ) and the constant k as, respectively, the center and the ray of the neighi j
borhood Mi,j,k .

We also say that, given two bipartite graphs G1 = (V1 ∪ V2 , E1 ) and G2 = (V1 ∪ V2 , E2 ),
then Sx1 ,y1 and Sx2 ,y2 are common regions of both G1 and G2 only if x1 = x2 and y1 = y2 .

Problem Formulation

3.1

Reference Model for the Observed Data

As is used to represent sets of many interacting entities, we can express relationships between
MS signals of a given case or control group through a graph whose vertices are observed massto-charge ratios, and edges represent dependencies between signal intensities with diﬀerent
mass-to-charge values. Broadly speaking, we assume there is a system under study that may
be represented by a graph G = (V, E) (say population graph), however instead of having all
of G available to us, we take measurements that eﬀectively yield a sample of vertices V˜ ⊆ V
˜ ⊆ E, which we compile into our data model R = (V˜ , E).
˜ In fact, we extend this
and edges E
case
ctrl
and a control G
population graph. That is, the
assumption by considering both a case G
measurements yield two models Rcase and Rctrl which we respectively refer to as the case and
the control template. Here the target is to sample neighborhoods from both the case template
Rcase and the control template Rctrl , in such a way that we can deﬁne test of hypotheses by
conjecturing statements over the “population graph” parameters, for instance being given by
the neighborhood densities associated to the case and control “population graphs”.
More formally, we observe a set of N mass-to-charge ratios {m1 , m2 , . . . mN } and for
each mass-to-charge ratio ms , 1 ≤ s ≤ N , we measure a vector of intensity levels
{ims ,1 , ims ,2 , . . . , ims ,n }. Moreover, let I case and I ctrl be the case and control groups, respectively. We assume that each group (for example, I ctrl ) can be expressed through a product
ctrl

× Im
× . . . × Im
of spaces Im

,

ms
where Ims is the random variable expressing the signal intensity for a protein/peptide molecule
with mass to charge ratio ms 7 .
A simple but commonly used measure to quantify dependencies between variables is the mutual information [7]. Thus, we employ mutual information to quantify dependencies between
pairs of signals with diﬀerent mass-to-charge value. Let us consider the following deﬁnition for
any group of patients g on which is deﬁned a distribution fIgms .
Deﬁnition 4 (Template). Let g be a group of subjects. For each s, t ∈ [N ] let {ims ,1 , . . . , ims ,n }
and {imt ,1 , . . . , imt ,n } be two sets of observations obtained from fIgms and fIgm . We call
t
template (of g) the bipartite graph Rg = (V1 ∪ V2 , E) with V1 = {m1 , m2 , . . . , mN }, V2 =

follow the standard convention that random variables are denoted by upper case letters (e.g., random
intensities Ims ), and observations (i.e., intensity values ims ) are denoted by lower case letters.

3.2

Reference Method to Provide Decisions

We assume that templates can be thought of as graphs from a larger underlying “population
graphs”. Moreover, we recall that statistical hypotheses (noted as H0 and HA ) are competing
statements concerning the population parameters. This way templates establish abstract frames
of reference, giving the opportunity to employ statistical test of hypotheses over their properties.
The rationale for establishing our hypotheses is deciding whether the case template (e.g., ccRCC
template) shows modiﬁed neighborhood cohesion as compared to the control template. Since we
use edge densities to analyze cohesion, we should also say that for two sets of neighborhoods to
be consistent with the above rationale, it is enough that μctrl = μcase , where μctrl and μcase are
the neighborhood mean densities in the population graphs of the case/control groups. Moreover,
given a template R = (V1 ∪ V2 , E), we can easily provide a set of density measurements D =
{den(M1R ), den(M2R ), . . . , den(MnR )} by sampling a set of neighborhoods {M1R , M2R , . . . , MnR }
from R9 . Hence in order to check a signiﬁcant diﬀerence of the neighborhood mean density
between groups of neighborhoods provided from two diﬀerent population graphs we can simply
match pairs of neighborhoods in the (associated sample) template models Rcase and Rctrl .
Therefore, given the following quantities:
• the (paired) samples of density measurements (from controls)
Dctrl = {den(M1ctrl ), den(M2ctrl ), . . . , den(Mnctrl )},
• the (paired) samples of density measurements (from cases)
Dcase = {den(M1case ), den(M2case ), . . . , den(Mncase )},
• their diﬀerences D = {Di : Di = Xi − Yi , Xi ∈ Dctrl , Yi ∈ Dcase },
˜ and
• the sample mean D
• the sample standard deviation of diﬀerence scores Σd ,
then we can reject the null H0 : μctrl = μcase (no change) in favor of the alternative HA :
˜
√ as test statistic which in turn follows a Student’s t-distribution
μctrl = μcase using T = ΣdD
/ n
with n − 1 degree of freedom if H0 is true. Thus, we apply a classical two-sample, paired t-test,
rejecting the null when the realization t of the statistic T is such that |t| > t1−α/2 (n − 1), where
t1−α/2 (n − 1) is the quantile of Student’s t-distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom.
The use of regions gives us the opportunity to analyze the neighborhood cohesion in diﬀerent
parts of the graph. This way, we can consider diﬀerent regions over the spectra – through
diﬀerent “local statistics”, and perform diﬀerent tests. Speciﬁcally, given two regions S1 and
and DScase
simply
S2 common both to Rctrl and Rcase , we can obtain two sets of densities DSctrl
1
2
by sampling neighborhoods from S1 and S2 respectively. As previously stated, using these data
as observations provided by sampling neighborhoods both from control and case groups in S1
case
case
and S2 , we are able to apply the test H0 : μctrl
against HA : μctrl
for any pair
S1 = μ S2
S1 = μ S2
8 In

this paper we apply the histogram estimation. More sophisticated techniques are discussed in [17].
we use the notation MiR to emphasize that the ith neighborhood is sampled from R. Below we will
use similar notation when the sampling is done from a region S of e.g., a control template Rctrl . In that case
the sample is denoted by {M1ctrl,S , M2ctrl,S , . . . , Mnctrl,S }.

of regions S1 and S2 ; that is, by observing regions diﬀerently located over the graphs, we test
the neighborhood cohesion modiﬁcations from group to group in diﬀerent parts of the spectra.
We summarize the Case VS Control tests through the following procedure.
1. We represent Rctrl (as in section 3.1) by observing (from the control group) for each pair
(mi , mj ) the intensities {imi ,1 , imi ,2 , . . . , imi ,n } and {imj ,1 , imj ,2 , . . . , imj ,n }.
2. We represent Rcase (as in section 3.1) by observing (from the case group) for each pair
(mi , mj ) the intensities {imi ,1 , imi ,2 , . . . , imi ,n } and {imj ,1 , imj ,2 , . . . , imj ,n }.
3. Given any pair of regions S1 and S2 , common both to Rctrl and Rcase , we obtain the local

Reference Model of Variability

Starting from an observed template Rg = (V1 ∪ V2 , E) we wish to deﬁne a random graph able
to preserve (within a deﬁned range) a property of it. A random graph Γ can be deﬁned as
a probability space of the form (G, Pr) where G is an “ensemble” of possible graphs and Pr
is a probability measure [2]. The diﬀerence among various models depends largely on how we
specify G and Pr [14, 12]. Some methods for example, let Pr be uniform (all graphs have
equal probability), restricting G to contain only those graphs with speciﬁc properties. Other
approaches induce Pr through the application of some generative mechanisms. Here we follow
the latter approach.
As we just stated above in section 3, our interest is to analyze the neighborhood cohesion
of an observed graph (i.e., template) Rg . Hence, we attempt to preserve the densities of Rg
by preserving (on average) its size. Among the many methods for deﬁning a random graph
from any observed graph (see, for example, the problem of graph randomization [10]), while
preserving some properties, we simply “modify” randomly the edges of Rg . We realize this
perturbation in such a way that the expected number of “modiﬁcations” takes values inside
speciﬁc ranges. The following deﬁnition formalizes this (random) mechanism.
Deﬁnition 5 ((s, t, Rg )–Preserving Random Graph). Let Rg = (V1 ∪ V2 , E) be a template. We
consider the following experiment. For any e ∈ V1 × V2 if e ∈ E we delete e with probability
p. Otherwise, if e ∈
/ E, we add e to E with probability p. We say that this mechanism deﬁnes
an (s, t, Rg )–preserving r.g. τ (s, t) if the expected number of edge additions and deletions in Rg
take values in [s, t].
Please note that, since any region S of Rg is simply a sub-graph of Rg , we can also apply
deﬁnition 5 to regions. Let S be any region of Rg , we say that τ (s, t) is an (s, t, S)–preserving
RG if the condition of deﬁnition 5 is veriﬁed for S. Moreover, it is easy to prove the following
result.

Property 1. Let Rg = (V1 ∪ V2 , E) be a template. We should obtain an (s, t, Rg )–preserving
r.g. τ (s, t) by constraining the “perturbation” probability p in deﬁnition 5 in such a way that
s
t
2
n2 ≤ p ≤ n2 , where n = |V1 × V2 |.
Proof. Let Xe be the r.v. which expresses the “modiﬁcation” of any e ∈ V1 × V2 in Rg =
(V1 ∪ V2 , E), i.e., Xe = 1 if e is added to (or deleted from) E; Xe = 0 otherwise. By assumption
Xe ∼ Ber(p) (i.e., Bernoulli r.v. of parameter p). Let ns2 ≤ p ≤ nt2 for any pair of integers
s ≤ t. Then we have X = e∈V1 ×V2 Xe ; that is X counts the number of edges which have been
“modiﬁed” (added/deleted) in Rg . Since |V1 × V2 | = n2 , we have that X ∼ Bin(n2 , p) (i.e., a
Binomial r.v. of parameters n2 and p), then we have s ≤ E[X] = n2 p ≤ t.
As previously reported in section 3.2, we can also formulate the test of hypotheses when
the perturbation mechanism in deﬁnition 5 is applied. To tackle this problem, we turn e.g., to
a well-known form of the Monte Carlo method. Here, we summarize the Control vs Case tests
through the following procedure.
1. We deﬁne Rctrl as in step 1 of the Controls VS. Cases procedure (section 3.2).
2. We deﬁne Rcase as in step 2 of the Controls VS. Cases procedure (section 3.2).

we generate two (Monte Carlo) samples:

RCC Analysis

This study has been applied to data provided and elaborated from a cohort of subjects screened
at the “Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico”, San Gerardo Hospital (Monza, Italy) and Desio Hospital
(Desio, Italy). The samples consists of 85 control subjects and 102 RCC patients. Patients have
been divided into groups according to their pathologies: clear cell RCC (n = 79) and other
diﬀerent histological subtypes i.e., non-ccRCC (n = 23). Speciﬁc mass spectrometry techniques
and elaborations (see e.g. [6]) were applied to obtain the following data sets. i) Data collection
1: Control and ccRCC MS data (85 control vs 79 ccRCC patients); ii) Data collection 2: Control
and non-ccRCC MS data (85 control vs 23 non-ccRCC patients); iii) Data collection 3: ccRCC
and non-RCC MS data (79 ccRCC patients vs 23 non-ccRCC patients).
We summarize our RCC analysis as follows 10 .

Numerical Experiments

In Sec. 3, by introducing the reference model of variability, we provided a perturbation mechanisms for the data reference model (i.e. template). This way, we can also interpret robustness
as the persistence of statistical conclusions against template perturbation. With this concern
in mind, here discuss some numerical results obtained after perturbations of the template’s
parameters.
We divided each template into a ﬁxed number of regions (i.e., 8). This way, for a given pair
Rctrl and Rcase , tests were deﬁned over 8 diﬀerent pairs of regions, common both to Rctrl and
Rcase . We also deﬁned a set of arbitrary thresholds T = {0.01, 0.006, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001} and
a set of arbitrary (neighborhood) rays R = [4]. Thus, for each combination of δ ∈ T and k ∈ R,
689

we considered (for each class of tests) the number of signiﬁcant tests rejecting the null hypothesis. For each class we evaluated (empirically) the threshold δ, and ray k detecting a low number
of dependence structure modiﬁcations from control to case groups. By using these values (i.e.
δ and k), we detected the mass-to-charge ratio bounds identifying modiﬁed regions over the
spectra at a speciﬁc level of signiﬁcance. Each class of test was applied to its associated data
collection. Table 1a reports for each class the spectra bounds which constrain pairs of regions,
common both to the case (i.e., ccRCC or non-ccRCC) and control groups, where tests have
rejected the null hypothesis at the 5% signiﬁcance level, thus stating that a diﬀerence in the
neighborhood mean density of these regions exists between case and control groups. We referred
to these regions as distinguishing regions, shortly reported as DR. We called the regions which
are not constrained by the bounds in table 1a, non-distinguishing regions, shortly reported as
NDR. These are regions where tests have accepted the null hypothesis thus stating that no
diﬀerence in the considered cohesion exists between case and control groups. To check the robustness of test decisions (equivalently, the robustness of the distinguishing/non-distinguishing
capabilities for all the considered common regions) we veriﬁed whether after the application of
the variability model in deﬁnition 5, the capability of any pair of common regions to distinguish (i.e., DRs) or to not distinguish (i.e., NDRs) – between control and case, was preserved.
Clearly, after a perturbation, we can still obtain new distinguishing / non-distinguishing regions
following the test decisions, as previously performed before the application of the considered
mechanism. Therefore, the question of interest was to asses the association between the two
categorical variables that can be considered in the above argumentation: (i) from one side, the
distinguishing capability before the perturbation – which divide the regions into DRs and NDRs
respectively and, (ii) from the other, the test of hypotheses decision after the perturbation –
which in turn may accept or reject that the considered DRs and NDRs still preserve their distinguishing capabilities, as previously observed. These are the type of questions that Fisher’s
exact test (for small samples) is designed to answer. Hence, we veriﬁed whether the three pairs
of DRs (common both to control and case groups), identiﬁed by the (m/z) bounds in Table
1a, still preserved their DR capabilities. Similarly, we veriﬁed whether the remaining NDRs
still preserved their NDR capabilities after the realized perturbation. Tables 1b summarize the
results for each class CVR, CVNR and, RVNR respectively. These tables report for diﬀerent
values of the perturbation probabilities the number of tests accepting H0 (HA ) against the region’s property after the applied perturbations. For example, given a perturbation probability
of 0.05 (Table 1b), none of the 12 tests, performed over the three common DRs, modiﬁed their
conclusions (still rejecting the null). On the other hand, only 1 of the 20 tests, performed over
NDRs, gave a diﬀerent conclusion, i.e., accepting the alternative hypothesis. To apply Fisher’s
test we evaluated the probability of obtaining our results or more extreme results. This gives the
one-side p–values reported in Table 1c. Fisher’s exact test conﬁrms a signiﬁcant association,
at the 0.001 level, between decisions and region’s property with perturbation equal to 0.005
and 0.1 for CVR tests and up to perturbations equal to 0.3 for both the CVNR and RVNR
tests. For these probabilities values, tests still preserve their decisions - as previously obtained,
providing robust conclusions in the experimental design. We can also say that, by considering
as acceptable those template modiﬁcations for which at most, about 22 (i.e., by deﬁning a
τ (0, 22) r.g. in property 1) of the possible edges are removed one is able to obtain, thanks to
property 1, the perturbation probability p ≤ 0.1 for observing robust conclusions for the CVR
class. Moreover, with the same frequency of modiﬁcations we still preserve process decisions
for the other classes of tests. In other words, in order for the modeler to evaluate whether a
set of acceptable parameters e.g., {s, t} provides reliable conclusions he can simply apply the
perturbation mechanism over the observed model, and check whether for these parameters a

perturbation probability satisfying property 1 give rise to decisions, which still preserve the

Conclusions

The robustness of a biological system is mainly deﬁned as a property of a biological function [11].
For this reason robustness here relates to the determination of the eﬀect of certain perturbations
on the spectra signals of peptide/protein relationships. In fact, many domains are best described
by “relational” models in which instances of multiple types are related to each other in complex
ways. In such situations “relational data” may increase e.g. the performance of classiﬁcation
or clustering models for “diﬃcult” data sets (e.g. [8, 21, 20, 1]). To this concern it is important
to note that classiﬁcation or clustering problems not only are two main fundamental issues
for the machine learning community, but they even have been studied from computational
point of view [3]. Graphs provide a canonical representation for “relational data” and their
employment to reinterpret traditional data seems to be promising in order to better understand
and summarize relationships amongst very large number of observations. In this paper graphs
3.2 was employed to deﬁne a reference method for our analysis. Using this approach we obtained
“diﬀerentially expressed” spectra regions between case/control groups. Many questions still
need to be addressed in future analysis. For example, we employed the reference method to
obtain distinguishing regions for their biological evidence, but a better molecular understanding
of the added/deleted edges (i.e., molecular dependencies) should be clearly more appealing from
a biological point of view. Further analysis should concern the use of some parameters which we
have arbitrary deﬁned as constant values. Probably the most critical parameter is the threshold
(delta) for representing in section 3.1 dependencies in the template graphs. The selection of
these values can have diﬀerent eﬀects on the model accuracy. Finally from a clinical prospective,
since proteins that are diﬀerentially expressed as a consequence of a disease have great potential
as new bio-markers, we need to conclusively determine both the classiﬁcation predictive power
of the RCC distinguishing regions and their biological identity aimed to explore the structure
and function of these potential bio-markers.
