Abstract. This short paper is intended to give our readers a brief insight about the Eight International Workshop on Computer Graphics
and Geometric Modeling-CGGM’2009, held in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
(USA), May 25-27 2009 as a part of the ICCS’2009 general conference.

CGGM Workshops
Aims and Scope

Computer Graphics (CG) and Geometric Modeling have become two of the most
important and challenging areas of Computer Science. The CGGM workshops
seek for high-quality papers describing original research results in those ﬁelds.
Topics of the workshop include (but not limited to): geometric modeling, solid
modeling, CAD/CAM, physically-based modeling, surface reconstruction, geometric processing and CAGD, volume visualization, virtual avatars, computer
animation, CG in Art, Education, Engineering, Entertainment and Medicine,
rendering techniques, multimedia, non photo-realistic rendering, virtual and augmented reality, virtual environments, illumination models, texture models, CG
and Internet (VRML, Java, X3D, etc.), artiﬁcial intelligence for CG, CG software
and hardware, CG applications, CG education and new directions in CG.

CGGM Workshops History

The history of the CGGM workshops dates back nine years ago, when some researchers decided to organize a series of international conferences on all aspects
of computational science. The ﬁrst edition of this annual conference was held
in San Francisco in 2001 under the name of International Conference on Computational Science, ICCS. This year ICCS conference is held in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana (USA).

After ICCS’2001, I realized that no special event devoted to either computer
graphics or geometric modeling had been organized at that conference. Aiming
to ﬁll this gap, I proposed a special session on these topics to ICCS’2002 organizers. Their enthusiastic reply encouraged me to organize the ﬁrst edition of
this workshop, CGGM’2002. A total of 81 papers from 21 countries were submitted to the workshop, with 35 high-quality papers ﬁnally accepted and published
by Springer-Verlag, in its Lectures Notes in Computer Science series, vol. 2330.
This great success and the positive feedback of authors and participants motivated that CGGM became an annual event on its own. Subsequent editions
were held as follows (see [1] for details): CGGM’2003 in Montreal (Canada),
CGGM’2004 in Krakow (Poland), CGGM’2005 in Atlanta (USA), CGGM’2006
in Reading (UK), CGGM’2007 in Beijing (China) and CGGM’2008 again in
Krakow (Poland). All of them were published by Springer-Verlag, in its Lecture
Notes in Computer Science series, volumes 2668, 3039, 3515, 3992, 4488 and 5102
with a total of 52, 24, 22, 22, 20 and 16 contributions, respectively. In addition,
one Special issue has been published in 2004 in the Future Generation Computer
Systems - FGCS journal [2]. Another special issue on CGGM’2007 is available
online and in the way to be published in printed form soon.

CGGM’2009

This year CGGM has received a total of 11 papers of which 6 have been accepted
as full papers. The reader is referred to [3] for more information about the workshop. The workshop chair would like to thank the authors, including those whose
papers were not accepted, for their contributions. I also thank the referees (see
the CGGM’2009 International Program Committee and CGGM’2009 International Reviewer Board in [3]) for their hard work in reviewing the papers and
making constructive comments and suggestions, which have substantially contributed to improving the workshop.

Acknowledgments
This workshop has been supported by the Spanish Ministry of Education and
Science, National Program of Computer Science, Project Ref. TIN2006-13615
and the University of Cantabria. The CGGM’2009 chair also thanks Dick van
Albada, workshops chair of general conference ICCS’2009 for his all-time availability and diligent work during all stages of the workshop organization. Thanks
for your support, Dick!
