Abstract. We compare three methods of constructing conﬁdence intervals for sample autocorrelations of squared returns modeled by models from the GARCH family. We compare the residual bootstrap, block
bootstrap and subsampling methods. The residual bootstrap based on
the standard GARCH(1,1) model is seen to perform best.

Introduction

The paper is concerned with assessing ﬁnite sample performance of several methods of ﬁnding conﬁdence intervals for autocorrelations of squared returns on
speculative assets. While the returns themselves are essentially uncorrelated and
most econometric and ﬁnancial models explicitely imply that they are so, their
squares exhibit a rich dependence structure. The sample autocorrelation of squared returns ρˆn,X 2 (·) is a measure of volatility clustering. A large value for ρˆn,X 2 (·)
is the evidence of either the presence of long memory in the volatility process,
or the inadequacy of a GARCH(1,1) process to ﬁt the data under investigation
as the true process might be a non–homogeneous GARCH(1,1) process; see [6].
We compare the performance of the various methods by means of their empirical coverage probability (ECP). Suppose we have a method of constructing, say,
a 95% conﬁdence interval (ˆln , u
ˆn ) from an observed realization X1 , X2 , . . . , Xn .
We simulate a large number R of realizations from a speciﬁc GARCH type mo(r)
(r)
del from which we construct R conﬁdence intervals (ˆln , u
ˆn ), r = 1, 2, . . . , R.
The percentage of these conﬁdence intervals that contain the population autocorrelation is the ECP, which we want to be as close as possible to the nominal
coverage probability of 95%. Our objective is to provide answers to the following
questions: Does any method have better ECP than the others? If not, what is the
range of optimal applicability of each method? Is it better to use equal-tailed or
symmetric conﬁdence intervals (see Section 2.1)? How does the coverage depend

on the value of γc2 ? For a given series length n, how should one choose the block
length b for the block bootstrap and subsampling? For what lengths n do these
methods yield useful conﬁdence intervals?
The ultimate goal is to recommend a practical procedure for ﬁnding conﬁdence intervals for squared autocorrelations which assumes minimal prior knowledge of the stochastic mechanism generating the returns.
For ease of reference, recall that the sample autocovariances of the squared
returns are

In Section 2, we describe the three methods. Section 3 introduces the various
GARCH models we use for the comparison. The results of our simulations are
presented in Section 4 with broad conclusions summarized in Section 4.3.

2.1

Conﬁdence Intervals for ACF of Squared Returns
Residual Bootstrap

To illustrate the idea, we consider the ARCH(1) model given by
Xt = σt Zt ,

2
σt2 = ω + αXt−1
.

(3)

As we will see in Section 3, the method can be readily extended to any parametric
model deﬁned by GARCH type equations by computing the residuals Zˆt =
Xt /ˆ
σt . Since the conditional volatility σt2 is a function of the model parameters,
past observations and past innovations, σ
ˆt2 can be computed recursively once
parameter estimates are available. We then proceed as follows:

(b)
3. Calculate the bootstrap autocorrelations ρn,X 2 (1), b = 1, 2, . . . , B and use
their empirical quantiles to ﬁnd a conﬁdence interval for ρn,X 2 (1).

We now enlarge on step 3). Denote by Fρ(1)
the EDF (empirical distribution
(b)

function) of the ρn,X 2 (1), b = 1, 2, . . . , B. The (α/2)th and (1 − α/2)th quantiles
∗
will yield an equal-tailed (1 − α) level conﬁdence interval. To construct
of Fρ(1)
a symmetric conﬁdence interval centered at ρˆn,X 2 (1), we need the empirical
(b)
∗
distribution Fρ(1),|·|
of the B values |ρn,X 2 (1) − ρˆn,X 2 (1)|. Denote by q|·| (1 − α)
∗
the (1 − α) quantile of Fρ(1),|·|
. Then the symmetric conﬁdence interval is
ρˆn,X 2 (1) − q|·| (1 − α),

ρˆn,X 2 (1) + q|·| (1 − α) .

A usual criticism of methods based on a parametric model is that misspeciﬁcation can lead to large biases. In many applications however these biases have
only negligible impact on a statistical procedure of interest. In our setting, we
will see that the residual bootstrap conﬁdence intervals based on a misspeciﬁed
model can produce good coverage probabilities.
2.2

Block Bootstrap

In this section we describe how the popular block-bootstrap of [5] can be used to
construct conﬁdence intervals for autocorrelations. This method does not require
a model speciﬁcation, but it relies on a choice of the block size b which is often
a diﬃcult task. A good account of block bootstrap is given in [1].
Focusing again on lag one sample autocorrelation of the squared observations, we proceed as follows: having observed the sample X12 , . . . , Xn2 , form the
2
vectors Y2 = [X12 , X22 ] , Y3 = [X22 , X32 ] , . . . , Yn = [Xn−1
, Xn2 ] . There are
n − 1 such vectors. Now choose a block length b and compute the number of
blocks k = [(n − 1)/b] + 1 (if (n − 1)/b is an integer we take k = (n − 1)/b).
Choose k blocks with replacement to obtain kb vectors. Choosing the k blocks
corresponds to generating k observations from the uniform distribution on
{2, 3, . . . , n−b+1}. Denote these observations j1 , j2 , . . . , jk . We thus obtained the
kb vectors Yj1 , Yj1 +1 , . . . , Yj1 +b−1 , . . . , Yjk , Yjk +1 , . . . , Yk1 +b−1 . If (n − 1)/b is
not an integer, remove the last few vectors to have exactly n − 1 vectors. This
gives us the bootstrap vector process
∗2
Y2∗ = [X1∗2 , X2∗2 ] , Y3∗ = [X2∗2 , X3∗2 ] , . . . , Yn∗ = [Xn−1
, Xn∗2 ] .

The bootstrap sample autocovariances are computed according to (1) with the
Xt replaced by the Xt∗ deﬁned above. The empirical distribution of ρˆ∗n,X 2 (1) is
then an approximation to the distribution of ρˆn,X 2 (1). As described in Section
2.1, the quantiles of the empirical distribution of |ˆ
ρ∗n,X 2 (1) − ρˆn,X 2 (1)| can be
used to construct symmetric conﬁdence intervals.
2.3

Subsampling

The subsampling methodology is described in detail in [7]. [8] investigated subsampling conﬁdence intervals for autocorrelations of linear time series models
like ARMA. We adapt their methodology to the squares of GARCH processes.

tailed and symmetric conﬁdence intervals, we would need to know the sampling
distribution of ξˆn and |ξˆn |, respectively. We use subsampling to approximate
these distributions: Consider an integer b < n and the n − b + 1 blocks of data
Xt , . . . , Xt+b−1 , t = 1, . . . , n − b + 1. From each of these blocks compute ρˆb,t (h)
and σ
ˆb,t (h) according to respectively (1), (2) and (4), but replacing the original
data X1 , . . . , Xn by Xt , . . . , Xt+b−1 . Next, compute the subsampling counterpart

with Nb = n−b+1. The empirical quantiles of Lb and Lb,|·| allow us to construct,
respectively, equal-tailed and symmetric conﬁdence intervals. For example, denoting by qb,|·| (1 − α) the (1 − α)th quantile of Lb,|·| , a subsampling symmetric
1 − α level conﬁdence interval for ρn (h) is
ρˆn (h) − σ

GARCH Models

We consider the general framework for GARCH models proposed and studied
by [4]; see also references quoted therein. The observations Xt are thus assumed
to satisfy Xt = Zt σt , where Zt is a sequence of independent identically distri2
buted random variables with zero mean and σt2 = g(Zt−1 ) + c(Zt−1 )σt−1
. We
considered only speciﬁcations in which the function g(·) is a constant and the Zt
are standard normal. Denoting γci = Eci (Zt ), [4] proved that under the above
assumptions a suﬃcient and necessary condition for the existence of the 2mth
unconditional moment of Xt is γcm = Ecm
t < 1. Thus, the fourth unconditional
moment of Xt exits if and only if γc2 = Ec2t ∈ [0, 1). We considered the following
three speciﬁc models:
1. The standard GARCH(1, 1) model, for which
2
ct−1 = β + αZt−1
,

2
2
σt2 = ω + αXt−1
+ βσt−1
.

(5)

2. The GJR-GARCH(1, 1) model, see [3], with
2
ct−1 = β +(α+φI(Zt−1 ))Zt−1
,

2
2
σt2 = ω+(α+φI(Zt−1 ))Xt−1
+βσt−1
, (6)

where I(Zt−1 ) = 1 if Zt−1 < 0, and I(Zt−1 ) = 0 otherwise.

3. The nonlinear GARCH(1,1) model (NL GARCH(1,1,2), see [2], with
2
;
ct−1 = β + α(1 − 2η sign(Zt−1 ) + η 2 )Zt−1
2
2
σt2 = ω + α(1 − 2η sign(Zt−1 ) + η 2 )Xt−1
+ βσt−1
.

(7)

Assuming the errors Zt ∼ N (0, 1), the values of γc2 and ρX 2 (1) can be
computed in a closed form. If we know the model parameters, we can calculate
precisely the population autocorrelation ρX 2 (1) and the value of γc2 .
For each of the three models, we considered ﬁve parameter choices, which we
labeled as models 1 through 5. The lag one autocorrelations for these choices
are, respectively, approximately .15, .22, .31, .4, .5. The corresponding values
of γc2 are respectively, approximately .1, .3, .5, .7, .9. To facilitate comparison,
models with the same index have similar values of γc2 and ρX 2 (1), e.g. standard
GARCH and GJR-GARCH with index 3 both have γc2 ≈ .5 and ρX 2 (1) ≈ .31.

Simulation Results

We investigate the performance of the three methods described in Section 2 by
comparing the empirical coverage probabilities (ECP’s) for the ﬁfteen data generating processes (DGP’s) introduced in Section 3. We generated one thousand
replications of each DGP and considered realizations of length n = 100, 250, 500,
1000. We focused on the most commonly used conﬁdence level of 95%. The standard errors in all tables are about 0.5% and are always smaller than 1%.
4.1

Residual Bootstrap

Table 4.1 presents the ECP of the symmetric conﬁdence interval for the three
GARCH models. To save space the results for the equal-tailed conﬁdence interval are not presented, but are discussed in the following conclusions. Equaltailed and symmetric conﬁdence intervals perform equally well for the standard
GARCH and GJR-GARCH. However, for the NL GARCH, the symmetric interval is better than the equal-tailed. It is thus seen that the symmetric conﬁdence
interval is preferred over the equal-tailed. The ECP decreases as the value of
γc2 approaches 1. Recall that γc2 < 1 is required for the population autocovariances to exist. When γc2 ≈ 0.9, at least 250 observations are needed to ensure
reasonable ECP for the standard GARCH and the GJR-GARCH. For the NL
GARCH, even series length of 1000, does not produce satisfactory results. For
the standard GARCH and the GJR-GARCH increasing the sample size from
500 to 1000 does not improve the ECP. For the NL GARCH a sample size of
1000 observations is needed, except when γc2 ≤ 0.3.
The somewhat worse performance of the residual bootstrap method for the
GJR-GARCH which becomes markedly worse for the NL GARCH can be attributed to identiﬁcation problems, which are particularly acute for the NL
GARCH: for the latter model biases of parameter estimates are very large when
η in equation (7) is large. Large η corresponds to large γc2 , we omit the details

of the calculation. On the other hand, for the standard GARCH, while they still
do exist, the identiﬁcation problems are much less severe.
Figure 1 shows that estimating the standard GARCH model on all three
DGP’s might lead to improvements in ECP’s, for symmetric conﬁdence intervals
and series of length 500. The results for other series lengths look very much the
same and are therefore not presented. The residual bootstrap method works best
if symmetric conﬁdence intervals are used and the standard GARCH model is
estimated. Thus, in our context, misspecifying a model improves the performance
of the procedure.

Block Bootstrap and Subsampling

The implementation of both methods requires a choice of the block length b.
We then have a multitude of cases to explore: 15 models, 2 types of conﬁdence
intervals (equal-tailed and symmetric), 4 sample sizes and several choices of b.
Since we used 10 values of b in our experiments, we obtained 1,200 ECP’s. For
space constraints, we describe them and present some typical values in Table 2.
The empirical coverage probabilities are generally too low for all choices
of n and b and are in the range of 80% to 90% for γc2 ≤ 0.3 and go down
to slightly above 50% for γc2 ≈ 0.9. Irrespective of the value of γc2 , choosing
smaller b gives higher coverage. However, extremely small b, like 1 or 2, do not
work well. We recommend to use b = 3 or b = 5. The dependence on b is
however not substantial, which is very desirable, as in many other applications
choosing optimal b is very diﬃcult. There is not much diﬀerence of ECPs between
equal-tailed and symmetric conﬁdence intervals. The block bootstrap conﬁdence
intervals are generally too short and given that the QML estimates underestimate
the true value of the autocorrelation, they are shifted too much to the left what
causes the under-coverage.
We observed that the subsampling method is very sensitive to the choice of b.
Symmetric conﬁdence intervals have a much better ECP than the equal-tailed.
By choosing very short b’s, such as 3 or 6, we can obtain ECP’s that are quite
close to 95% for models with γc2 < 0.6 and fair coverage for models with greater
values of γc2 . Such choice of b is somewhat surprising, as autocovariances are
then computed from very short sub-series. The ECP’s are generally too low for
equal-tailed conﬁdence intervals and are typically in the range of 50-70%. As
γc2 approaches 1, the empirical coverage decrease and in some cases may be
as low as 10%. Complete tables for ECP’s are available at the following site:

Conclusions and Practical Recommendations

The best method is residual bootstrap which assumes a standard GARCH(1,1)
model. The block bootstrap and subsampling methods do not perform well when
γc2 approaches 1. Moreover, these methods require a choice of the block size b.
The latter problem is particularly acute for the subsampling method. Except for
the NL GARCH, the residual bootstrap method with correct model speciﬁcation
performs reasonably well even for γc2 close to 1. This is probably due to the fact
that large values for γc2 correspond to large values of model parameters which
are easier to estimate than small values yielding residuals which are close to the
unobservable errors. A graphical comparison of symmetric conﬁdence intervals
based on the three methods for n = 1000 is given below:
