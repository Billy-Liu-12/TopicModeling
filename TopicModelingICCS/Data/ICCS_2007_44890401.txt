Abstract. We study the problem of ﬁnding the (n, k, 0)-extendability
in bipartite graphs. Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G). Let n, k, d be
non-negative integers such that n+2k+d ≤ |V (G)|−2 and |V (G)|−n−d
is even. A matching which saturates exactly |V (G)| − d vertices of G is
called a defect-d matching of G. If when deleting any n vertices in V (G)
the remaining subgraph contains a matching of k edges and every kmatching can be extended to a defect-d matching, then G is said to
be (n, k, d)-extendable. We present an algorithm to ﬁnd the (n, k, 0)extendability for bipartite graphs. This problem ﬁnds application in the
circuit design of allocating jobs to processors while some jobs require
speciﬁed machines to process and some machines are not available. In
addition, the connectivity of (n, k, 0)-extendable graphs is also discussed.
Keywords: perfect matching, matching extendability, algorithms.

Introduction and Terminology

The graphs studied in this paper will be ﬁnite and simple. Let G = (V, E) be a
simple graph with vertex-set V (G) and edge-set E(G). A matching M is a subset
of E(G) of which the edges are disjoint. A vertex is said to be saturated with
respect to a matching if it is covered by the matching and unsaturated, otherwise.
The cardinality of matching is the number of edges it contains. A matching with
k edges is called to be a k-matching. A matching is said to be maximum if its
cardinality is the maximum in all matchings. Furthermore, a matching is called
a defect -d matching if it it covers exactly |V (G)| − d vertices of G. Let M be a
matching of G. If there is a matching M of G such that M ⊂ M , then M is
called an extension of M .
Let G be a graph with at least 2k +2 vertices. If G has a k-matching and every
k-matching is contained in a perfect matching, then G is said to be k-extendable.
The concept of extendability was introduced ﬁrstly by Heytei in 1964. The
extendability of graphs plays an important role in the decomposition theory by
means of maximum matchings. For the historic evolution and detailed results on
extendability, we refer the reader to [5][6].
Let G be a graph with vertex set V (G). Let n, k, d be non-negative integers
such that n + 2k + d ≤ |V (G)| − 2 and |V (G)| − n − d is even. If when deleting

any n vertices in V (G) the remaining subgraph contains a k-matching and every
k-matching can be extended to a defect-d matching, then G is said to be an
(n, k, d)-graph. The (n, k, d)-extendability is the maximum of value k0 such that
the graph G is a (n, k0 , d)-graph where n, d are constants.
The concept of (n, k, d)-graph was introduced by Liu and Yu [3]. And they
gave a characterization of (n, k, d)-graphs and investigated several properties
(such as connectivity, minimum degree, etc.).
It is straightforward that a bipartite graph cannot be (n, k, d)-extendable
where n > 0. Thus, we amend the deﬁnition of (n, k, d)-graph with respect to
bipartite graphs. Let G = (U, W ) be a bipartite graph with bipartitions U and
W . Without loss of generality, suppose |V (U )| ≤ |V (W )|. Let n, k, d be nonnegative integers such that n + k + d ≤ |V (W )| − 1 and k ≤ |V (U )| − 1. If when
removing any n vertices in V (W ) the remaining subgraph contains a k-matching
and every k-matching can be extended to a defect-d matching, then G is said to
be (n, k, d)-extendable.
For a vertex x, let Γ (x) denote the set of vertices that are adjacent to x. A
complete graph of order n is denoted by Kn . Therefore, K1 stands for a vertex.
And cK1 denotes a graph which consists of c isolated vertices, where c is a
natural number.

Preliminary Results

Lemma 1 (Plummer [7]). Let k be an integer such that 0 < k < |V (G)|/2.
If G is k-extendable then it is (k − 1)-extendable. And if G is a connected kextendable graph, then G is (k + 1)-connected.
Corollary 1. A graph G is k-extendable where 1 < k < |V (G)|/2. For every
(k − 1)-matching M , G − V (M ) is 1-extendable.
Lemma 2 (Liu, Yu [3]). A graph G is an (n, k, 0)-graph if and only if for any
S ⊂ V (G) where |S| = n, G − S is k-extendable.
Let G be a bipartite graph with a perfect matching M . The vertices of G can be
colored white and black such that no adjacent vertices has the same colors. An
orientation is deﬁned as follows: orient all edges of M from the white vertices
to the black ones and orient the other edges of G from the black vertices to the
→
−
white ones. The resulting directed graph is denoted by G (M ).
Lemma 3 (Zhang, Zhang [8]). Let G be a connected bipartite graph with a
→
−
perfect matching M . Then G is 1-extendable if and only if G (M ) is strongly
connected.
A general result is given in the following lemma.
Lemma 4 (Lakhal, Litzler [2]). Let G be a connected bipartite graph with a
perfect matching M . Then the extendability of G equals the strong connectivity
→
−
of G (M ).
Independently, the equivalent result of Lemma 5 was given in [1][4].

Our Results

Theorem 1. Let G be a graph which has a perfect matching. The graph G is
k-extendable if and only if for every connected component H of G, one of the
following propositions holds:
(a) When 2k < |V (H)|, H is a k-extendable graph.
(b) When 2k ≥ |V (H)|, H is a (|V (H)|/2 − 1)-extendable graph.
Proof. Necessity, ﬁrst. Suppose G is a k-extendable graph. Let H be a connected
component of G. Since G is k-extendable, there is a perfect matching of G
(denoted by M ). Furthermore, M E(H) is a perfect matching of H. Then, we
have |V (H)| is even.
If 2k < |V (H)|, let M be any k-matching of H. Since H has a perfect matching, the k-matching M exists. And M is also a k-matching of G. Then, there
is a perfect matching of G containing M (denoted by MG ), by the deﬁnition of
k-extendability. We have MG E(H) is perfect matching of H which contains
M . It follows.
If 2k ≥ |V (H)|, let M be any (|V (H)|/2 − 1)-matching of H. Let k =
|V (H)|/2 − 1. Since H has a perfect matching, the k -matching M exists. We
have k < k, so G is k -extendable, by Lemma 1. Furthermore, M is also a
k -matching of G, there is a perfect matching of G containing M (denoted by
MG ), since G is k -extendable. Then, MG E(H) is perfect matching of H which
contains M . It follows.
Suﬃciency. Let H1 , H2 , . . . , Hj be the connected components of G such that
G = H1 H2 . . . Hj . Let M be a perfect matching of G, by the assumption.
Let M be any k-matching of G. The existence of a k-matching can be concluded by the assumption. For every Hi where 1 ≤ i ≤ j, we assign the perfect
matching in Hi (denoted by Mi ) as follows:
– If M
E(Hi ) = ∅, let Mi = M E(Hi );
E(Hi ) = ∅ and |V (M
E(Hi ))| = |V (Hi )|, let Mi = M
E(Hi );
– If M
E(Hi ) = ∅ and |V (M
E(Hi ))| < |V (Hi )|, let k = |M
E(Hi )|.
– If M
E(Hi ) can be extended
Since Hi is k -extendable, by the assumption, M
to a perfect matching of Hi . Let Mi be this perfect matching.
Finally, we have that M1 M2
contains the k-matching M .

...

Mj is a perfect matching of G which

Diﬀerent from k-extendable graphs, (n, k, 0)-graphs have high connectivity. The
following theorem was given by Liu and Yu in [3]. Their proof does not cover all
the situations. We complete the remained parts as follows:
Theorem 2. Every connected (n, k, 0)-graph G is (n + k + 1)-connected where
k ≥ 1.
Proof. Suppose G is not (n + k + 1)-connected. Let S be a cut set of G with
minimum cardinality, then |S| ≤ n + k.
If |S| > n, choose S ⊂ S such that S = n. Then, by the Lemma 2. G − S
is k-extendable graph. S is not a cut set of G, by the minimum of S. Thus,

404

Y. Li and D. Lou

G − S is connected. Therefore, its connectivity is at least k + 1, by Lemma 1.
But S − S is a cut set of G − S and |S − S | < k + 1, a contradiction.
If |S| = n, let u be a vertex of S and H1 , H2 be two connected components in
G−S. Then, H1 and H2 have positive even order, by Lemma 2. Let v be a vertex
adjacent with u in H1 . We choose any vertex of H1 − v (denoted by v ). v {S −
u} is a vertex set whose cardinality is n. Then G−{v {S −u}} is k-extendable,
by Lemma 2. Let H be the connected component of G − {v {S − u}} which
v lies in. Since v and H2 are adjacent with u, it can be concluded that u and
H2 lie in H . Therefore, |V (H )| ≥ 4. The connected component H is at least
1-extendable, by Lemma 1 and Theorem 1. Thus, H is 2-connected. It indicates
that v and H2 is connected in H − u, a contradiction.

Fig. 1. The situation when |S| = n

If |S| < n, let H1 be a connected components in G − S. Then, H1 has positive
even order, by Lemma 2. If n − |S| ≤ |V (G − S − H1 )|, choose a set of vertices
(denoted by S ) such that S consists of a vertex (denoted by v) in H1 and
n−|S|−1 vertices in G−S −H1 . Then, we have |S S | = n. Thus, G−{S S }
is k-extendable, by Lemma 2. But H1 − v is a connected components with odd
order in G − {S S }, contradicting.
If n − |S| > |V (G − S − H1 )|, let H2 be a connected components in G − S such
that H2 is diﬀerent from H1 . Similarly, H2 has positive even order. Furthermore,
we have n − |S| ≥ |V (H2 )|. Let S be a set of vertices such that S consists of
|V (H2 )| − 1 vertices in H2 and n − |S| − (|V (H2 )| − 1) vertices in G − S − H2 .
Since |S S | = n, G − {S S } is k-extendable, by Lemma 2. But H2 \ S is a
component which contains exactly one vertex in G − {S S }, contradicting.
Since the determination of k-extendability is highly eﬃcient in bipartite
graphs [2], our investigation arises from the problem: for bipartite graph, is there
any relationship between (n, k, 0)-graphs and k-extendable graphs? We want to
search a necessary and suﬃcient condition. If such condition exists, we could

obtain the (n, k, 0)-extendability by means of ﬁnding k-extendability. Moreover,
how this operation can be done?
First, a necessary construction is given. For a bipartite graph G = (U, W )
where |U | ≤ |W |. Let n = |W | − |U |. Add n isolated vertices (i.e. nK1 ) into
V (U ) and connect them with every vertex in V (W ). The resulting graph is
denoted by G.
Theorem 3. Let G = (U, W ) be a connected bipartite graph where |U | ≤ |W |.
Let n = |V (W )| − |V (U )|. Then G is (n, k, 0)-extendable if and only if G is
(n + k)-extendable where 0 < k < |V (W )| − n.
Proof. Let m = |V (U )| and the new added vertices nK1 in G be v1 , v2 , . . . , vn
(denoted by U ).
Assume that G is (n + k)-extendable. Since G is connected, we have G is
connected, according to the construction of G. For any S ⊂ V (W ) with |S| = n
and any k-matching M of G − S, we need to show M can be extended to a
perfect matching of G − S.
First, we point out that G−S has a k-matching. Assume that S = {w1 , w2 , . . . ,
wn }. Then, the edges {(v1 , w1 ), (v2 , w2 ), . . . , (vn , wn )} is an n-matching (denoted
by M1 ) in G, since vi = vj and wi = wj for any i = j where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Then,
the graph G is n-extendable, by Lemma 1. Thus, there is a perfect matching
(denoted by M2 ) of G containing M1 . Then, M2 − M1 is a perfect matching in
G − V (M1 ). It indicates that there is a perfect matching in G − S. Hence, G − S
has a k-matching where 0 < k < |V (W )| − n.
Note that M M1 is an (n + k)-matching in G. Similarly, there is a perfect
matching (denoted by M ) of G containing M M1 . Then, M − M1 is a perfect
matching in G − S which contains the k-matching M . It follows.
Conversely, suppose that G is (n, k, 0)-extendable. First, we need to show that
G has an (n + k)-matching. For any set S ⊂ V (W ) such that |S | = n, assume
that S = {w1 , w2 , . . . , wn }. Note that G−S has a k-matching (denoted by Ma ),
by the deﬁnition of (n, k, 0)-graph. Similarly, the edges {(v1 , w1 ), (v2 , w2 ), . . . ,
(vn , wn )} is an n-matching (denoted by Mb ) in G. Thus, Ma Mb is an (n + k)matching of G.
For any (n + k)-matching of G (denoted by M ), let M1 = {(v1 , w1 ), (v2 , w2 ),
. . . , (vi , wi )} be the matching edges in M which have an end-vertex in V (U )
where 1 ≤ i ≤ n and let M2 = {(u1 , w1 ), (u2 , w2 ), . . . , (uj , wj )} be the matching
edges in M − M1 . We have i + j = n + k. Let S1 = {w1 , w2 , . . . , wi , w1 , w2 ,
. . . , wn−i }. Since the graph G is (n, k, 0)-graph, G − S1 is k-extendable. Furthermore, {(un−i+1 , wn−i+1 ), (un−i+2 , wn−i+2 ), . . . , (uj , wj )} is a k-matching
in G − S (denoted by M3 ). Hence, the matching M3 can be extended to a
perfect matching of G − S1 (denoted by M ). Let {(u1 , wi+1 ), (u2 , wi+2 ), . . . ,
(un−i , wn )} be the matching edges in M which have an end-vertex in V (M2 ). It
{wn−i+1 , wn−i+2 , . . . , wj } = ∅;
can be concluded that {wi+1 , wi+2 , . . . , wn }
that is {wi+1 , wi+2 , . . . , wn } V (M3 ) = ∅.

Let {vi+1 , vi+2 , . . . , vn } be the vertices in V (U )\V (M1 ). Finally, we can obtain a perfect matching which is {M \{(u1 , wi+1 ), (u2 , wi+2 ), . . . , (un−i , wn )}}
{(vi+1 , wi+1 ), (vi+2 , wi+2 ), . . . , (vn , wn )} M . It is straightforward that the
matching M is contained in this perfect matching.
An example is illustrated in Figure 2. The wavy lines stand for the edges in M .
The solid lines shows the edges in M .

The graphs we discuss in the following theorem are not necessary bipartite. To
be diﬀerent, denote a general graph by graph H. And we focus on the connected
graphs. The results for not connected graphs can be obtained easily.
Theorem 4. A connected graph H is k-extendable where k < |V (H)|/2 − 1.
Add a new vertex u to V (H) such that Γ (u) = ∅. The resulting graph, denoted
by H , is (0, k, 1)-extendable.
Proof. For any k-matching M in H , if M does not saturate the vertex u, then
M is also a k-matching in H. Since H is k-extendable, M is contained in a
perfect matching of H, denoted by M . Furthermore, M is a defect-1 matching
in H , which just misses the vertex u. It follows in this situation.
If M covers the vertex u, let the matching edge be (u, v). H is (k − 1)extendable by Lemma 1. Since M \(u, v) is a (k − 1)-matching in H, there is
a perfect matching of H, denoted by M , containing M \(u, v). In M , let the
matching edge covering v be (v, v ). We have v = u. And {M \(v, v )} {(u, v)}
is a defect-1 matching of H , which only misses the vertex v .
The following theorem can be proved by means of similar technique.
Theorem 5. A connected graph H is k-extendable where k < |V (H)|/2−1. Add
a set of vertices to V (H) (denoted by S) such that Γ (u) = ∅, for every u ∈ S.
The resulting graph is (0, k, |S|)-extendable.
Theorem 5 implies that the connectivity of (0, k, d)-graphs can be very small
where d ≥ 1. Furthermore, the connectivity is independent from the value k.

407

Thus, we cannot construct a (0, k, d)-graph to obtain a k-extendable graph by
means of similar method described in Theorem 3. We ﬁnd that this property
also holds for bipartite graphs.

Application

Since matching extension has many applications, our results will be useful. For
example, we ﬁnd that our results help to design the assignment circuit between
channels and processing machines. Suppose there are c jobs coming from c parallel channels which demand simultaneous processing. The same as the classical
job assignment, each job requires only a single machine for processing and every
machine can serve only one job at the same time. We study the problem of checking whether the circuit supports the assignment when some jobs speciﬁes some
machines to operate. Diﬀerent from the job scheduling problem, we consider
assignment rather than scheduling. Moreover, our goal is verifying the circuit
design instead of the minimization of the total processing time.

Fig. 3. Two examples

Denote a instance of the problem by a bipartite graph G = (J, M ) where
V (J) = {j1 , j2 , . . . , jc } are the jobs and V (M ) = {m1 , m2 , . . . , mc } are the
machines. In addition, if one job can be assigned to the machine, i.e. a job
can be processed by a machine, then there is an edge connecting them. It is
straightforward that the k-extendability of G is the maximum number (denoted
by k0 ) such that when any k0 jobs specify k0 distinct machines to process,
the other jobs can be assigned to the remaining machines. For instance, a 2extendable graph is presented on the left side of Figure 3. Thus, when any two
jobs require the desire distinct machines, the other jobs can ﬁnd machines to
process. Lakhal and Litzler [2] presented an algorithm to ﬁnd the k-extendability
of connected bipartite graphs. By Theorem 1, the improved algorithm for not
connected bipartite graphs can be developed.
In order to obtain higher robusty, more machines are deployed such that the
jobs can be processed even when some machines fail to work. Next, we focus

408

Y. Li and D. Lou

on this situation. Suppose there are n more machines of which an example is
illustrated on the right side of Figure 3. Then, it is natural to determine the
(n, k, 0)-extendability of the graph whose instance is the circuit. The algorithm
is given as follows:
Input: A bipartite G = (U, W )
Output: k0 /* the (n, k, 0)-extendability of G where n = ||W | − |U ||
k0 = 0 means that G is not (n, 1, 0)-extendable */
1) Suppose |U | < |W |. Let n = |W | − |U |
2) Construct G by adding n new isolated vertices (denoted by S) to V (U )
such that Γ (u) = V (W ), for every u ∈ S.
3) Find the extendability of G and store it in k
4) if k > n, then k0 = k − n; else k0 = 0. endif

Step 1) and 4) require O(1) time. Step 2) needs O(|V |) time. Step 3) can be
done in O(|E| · min(k03 + |V |, k0 |V |)). The corresponding algorithm is presented
in [2]. So our algorithm runs in O(|E| · min(k03 + |V |, k0 |V |)) time. It is superior
to the algorithm developed basing on the deﬁnition. The latter algorithm needs
to enumerate n vertices in the partition V (W ), ﬁrst. This enumeration demands
m!
n!(m−n)! time where m = |V (G)|. It is clear that the whole running time is even
larger.

Conclusions

We investigate the property of not connected k-extendable graphs and the connectivity of (n, k, 0)-graphs. For bipartite graphs, a necessary and suﬃcient
condition which illustrates the relation between (n, k, 0)-extendability and kextendability is presented. Basing on the condition, we develop an algorithm to
ﬁnd the (n, k, 0)-extendability of bipartite graphs. Our result is applicable in
many ﬁelds. For instance, it helps the design the circuit of the job assignment.
However, we notice that our method does not work for the (n, k, d)-extendability
where n, d are constants and d > 0. But we can determine (0, 1, 1)-extendable
general graphs eﬃciently using similar technique which will be given in subsequent paper.
