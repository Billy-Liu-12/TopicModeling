Abstract. The insertion reactions of singlet mono and dichlorocarbenes (1CHCl
and 1CCl2) into primary, secondary and tertiary C-H bonds of methane, ethane,
propane, n-butane and iso-butane have been investigated at ab initio (MP2) and
DFT levels invoking 6-31g(d, p) basis set. Among the σ and π insertions into
the said alkane C-H, both MP2 and DFT predict that the σ approach is slightly
favoured over the π approach. For inverted σ approach the barrier heights have
been found to be ca. 2 to 5 times that of the normal σ approach.

1 Introduction
The refrigerants hydrochloroflurocarbons (HCFCs) and hydroflurocarbons (HFCs) are
not harmful to ozone layer as they are oxidized / photodissociated to halocarbenes [1].
The halocarbenes and carbenes are important transient intermediates in organic
synthesis [2], in organometallic chemistry [3] and in gas phase combustion [4, 5]. In
the ground state the singlet halocarbenes are stabilized over the triplet carbenes by a
large σ - pπ separation [6, 7, 8] and inductive/ mesomeric effects or a combination of
both the effects. The vacant pπ and the occupied σ orbitals make them electrophiles
and nucleophiles respectively. The singlet carbenes follow the concerted one-step
process through a three-center cyclic transition state [9] (Scheme 1). As the short
lived transient carbenes can not be analysed easily by experimental methods,

ab initio quantum mechanical method could be used as a powerful tool to investigate
them. This is obvious from the fact that the activation barriers of 0 and 0.2 kcal/mol
for 1CH2 insertion into the C-H of methane and ethane respectively at MP3/6-31g (d)
[10-12] have been reported to be in excellent agreement with the experimental data
[2,13]. But calculations at HF level overestimate the activation barrier heights due to

lack of electron correlation [14-16]. In the halocarbenes, the halogens would interact
with the carbenic carbon through the oppositely operating electronic [mesomeric
(+M) - π donor and inductive (-I) - σ acceptor] effects. As a result of this the
electrophilicity of the halocarbenes decreases with increased halogenation [8,17].
Consequently the activation barrier increases because the primary step in the carbene
insertion is an electrophilic attack of the carbene center by the C-H bond. This
explains why the highly stable nucleophilic carbenes of Arduengo type [19] are
completely unreactive towards the C-H bonds. Hence nucleophilic carbene insertions
are generally not observed at low temperature matrixes However certain
intramolecular insertion of carbene into C-H bond at 11 K has been observed [18].
Considering the chlorocarbenes (CX2, X=H, Cl) as electrophiles, two different
pathways for the C-H insertion process have been proposed according to FMO
treatment [20, 21] (Scheme 2). In the π-approach the vacant pπ orbital of
chlorocarbene overlaps with the filled πCH2 fragment orbital of alkane (1a). In the σapproach the vacant pπ orbital of chlorocarbene overlaps with the σCH2 fragment
orbital of the alkane (1b). The activation barrier of the reaction pathway is studied
taking into account the orientation of the chlorocarbene and the electronic and steric
effects. With due consideration of the electronic and steric factors, the present
investigation focuses on the mechanism of 1CHCl and 1CCl2 insertion into the
primary, secondary and the tertiary C-H bonds of methane, ethane, propane, n-butane
and iso-butane (Scheme 3), as investigations of these have not been well documented.

2 Method of Calculations
This investigation was performed with Gaussian03W suite of program [22]
implemented on a Pentium IV/3.2 GHz processor. The geometries of the
chlorocarbenes, the alkane substrates, the transition states and the products have been
optimized initially at HF/6-31g (d, p) level. The resultant geometries were taken as
inputs for MP2 and B3LYP [23-27], investigations. For a better treatment of 1, 2hydrogen shift during the insertion process, standard 6-31g (d, p) [28, 29] basis set
has been adopted. In all the π-approaches the carbenic-carbon and the atoms of the CHR- unit of the alkane bearing the hydrogen that undergoes shift to the nucleophilic
face of the carbene were constrained to be in one plane during the geometry
optimization. The harmonic vibrational frequency calculations at MP2 and B3LYP
levels were carried out to characterize all the stationary points as either minima, firstorder transition states or second-order saddle points – SOSP.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Singlet Chlorocarbenes Insertion into Methane and Ethane
The activation energies analysed in this investigation have been computed at
B3LYP/6-31g (d, p) and MP2/6-31g (d, p) levels and all these have been listed in
column 2 to 5 of Table 1. The pπ of 1CHCl and 1CCl2 may interact with alkane’s
filled fragment orbital of either σ or π symmetry (Scheme 2). So chlorocarbenes
insertion reactions have been investigated for both (σ/π) the approaches and the σ
approach has been adjudicated to be the minimum energy path resulting in a staggered

conformer. Our recent investigation of fluorocarbenes insertion [17] and the earlier
report of carbene [30] and oxygen insertions [31] into C-H, also preferably
assume σ orientation over the π approach. The σ approaches of 1CHCl and 1CCl2
towards the C-H of methane are associated with the activation energies of 4.87 and
20.57 kcal/mol respectively at B3LYP/6-31g (d, p) (Table 1). The MP2/6-31g (d, p)
value for 1CHCl insertion is ca. 2 kcal/mol higher and that for 1CCl2 insertion is ca. 2
kcal/mol lower than those of the corresponding B3LYP/6-31g (d, p) values.
Replacement of hydrogen by chlorine in 1CHCl decreases its electrophilicity [32]. So
the barrier heights increase dramatically from 4.87 to 20.57 kcal/mol at B3LYP and
7.05 to 18.83 kcal/mol at MP2 calculations respectively for methane. Both in the σ
and the π orientations the enhanced nucleophilicity of ethane seems to be the reason
for the barrier height lowering through ~ 3.3 to 3.7 kcal/mol for 1CHCl insertion.
Similarly, the barrier height for 1CCl2 into ethane does show the same trend (a
reduction through ~4.5 to 5.9 kcal/mol). This aspect is clear from the fact that the
reactivity decreases as the chlorination increases in the carbene. An approximately
two to five fold increase in activation barrier (at B3LYP and MP2 levels) for inverted
σ/p approach of 1CHCl/1CCl2 may be attributed to the fact that the migrating
hydrogen approaches the smaller lobe of the σ orbital of carbene carbon having the
lone pair of electrons. Moreover the predominant π-donation over σ-attraction by
chlorine atom could be the reason for this enormous increase in the activation barrier
with the degree of chlorination.
Over all, the σCH2 orientation for 1CHCl(1CCl2) insertion has been found to be

slightly preferred over the πCH2 approach. The relevant geometrical parameters of the
transition states for the 1CHCl and 1CCl2 insertions in σ and p orientations have been
shown in Fig. 1. The TS for 1CCl2 insertion (TS-2) comes much later along the
reaction coordinate than that for 1CHCl insertion (TS-1) as reflected in the relative
C2-H1 bond distances of 1.430 (1.345) and 1.274 (1.202) Å and the charges on H1 of
0.284(0.260) and 0.253 (0.225) respectively.
3.2 Singlet Chlorocarbenes Insertion into C-H of Higher Alkanes

The higher alkanes have three types of C-H bonds (primary, secondary and tertiary;
Fig. 1) into which the carbenes can be inserted via the σ/π approach. The B3LYP and
MP2 barrier heights for these have been listed in Table 1. For the σ-insertion of
1
CHCl into primary C-H of ethane to iso-butane, the barrier heights calculated at
B3LYP/6-31g (d, p) have been found to be around 2.0 kcal/mol. But MP2 predictions
(~3.9 kcal/mol) are slightly higher by ca 1.9 kcal/mol. The small reduction in barrier
height on moving from methane to ethane (3.5 kcal/mol) should have been due to the
enhanced nucleophilicity by the methyl substituent in methane and this effect is
insignificant on further increasing the hydrocarbon chain length. The barrier heights
were found to be negative for σ approach at B3LYP/6-31g(d, p) for the insertion at
secondary and tertiary C-H (Table 1). But at MP2/6-31g(d, p) positive values have
been observed, exception being the C2 of iso-butane. The enhanced nucleophilicity of
the substrate might be the reason for the negative barrier heights.

If the carbene is 1CCl2 the barrier height decreases to ~16.8 kcal/mol at DFT for all
primary C-H insertions on comparison with that for methane and it falls around 13.7
kcal/mol at MP2 level. The decreased electrophilicity may be the reason for the
enhanced barrier heights. This trend also reveals that the steric factor has no
noticeable influence upon the insertion pathway. For secondary C-H, the barrier
heights have been found to be reduced to an average value of ca. 0.78 kcal/mol and
8.27 kcal/mol for insertion of 1CHCl and 1CCl2 respectively at MP2 level. The
proximity of the electron donating alkyl group to the insertion site might be the reason
for this result. This is further supported by the lowered barrier heights for insertion of
1
CHCl or 1CCl2 into the tertiary C-H of iso-butane both at B3LYP and MP2 levels.
3.3 Energetics
In the case of insertion of 1CHCl and 1CCl2 into an alkane, the order of the activation
barrier is : tertiary < seconday < primary (Table 1) . The above trend draws support
from the fact that the pair of electrons on the carbene carbon involved in the bonding
process is more and more stabilized with the degree of chlorination. Due to the less
availability of the electron pair on the cabene carbon, ease of bond formation is
inhibited. The NBO [33] analyses quantify this aspect in terms of the energies of the
electron pairs on 1CHCl and 1CCl2 as -0.4057 and -0.5595au at B3LYP and -0.4535
and -0.6019 au at MP2 respectively.
The enthalpies of chlorocarbene insertion reactions calculated from the equation,
ΔrHo(298 K) = Σ (εo + Hcorr )products - Σ ( εo + Hcorr )reactants
εo – total electronic energy; Hcorr – correction to the enthalpy due to internal energy
have been listed in Table 2. All the reaction enthalpies show the exothermicity of the
insertion reactions indicating that all the transition states analyzed resemble
the reactants rather than the products [34]. The proximity of the transition states to the

148

reactants deviates with the degree of chlorination of carbene. HF/6-31g(d, p)
calculations indicate an early transition state for the 1CH2 with exothermicity around
-94 kcal/mol [17] compared to those formed by 1CHCl/1CCl2. Irrespective of the level
of theory (B3LYP or MP2) followed, the insertions of 1CHCl form the transition
states earlier than those of 1CCl2 insertions as revealed by exothermicity values
(Table 2).

3.4 Transition State Geometries (NBO and IRC Analyses)
The relevant computed data for all the transition states have been shown in Table 3
and Table 4. A scrutiny of the bond breaking and bond formation steps corresponding
to C2-H1 and C1-H1 respectively during the insertion process reveals that it is a
concerted reaction. It is observed that the maturity of C1-H1 bond takes place earlier
than the C1-C2 bond in the TSs (Table 3 and Table 4). The C1-H1 distances are
inversely related to the barrier heights as expected. A similar relationship is also
obvious in the C1-C2 distances (Table 3 and Table 4). The C2-H1 distances in the
bond breaking process in all the transition states for 1CHCl insertions at B3LYP
(MP2)/6-31g(d, p) have been found to be ca. 1.264(1.197) Å, 1.272(1.149) Å and
1.324(1.132) Å, respectively for primary, secondary and tertiary C-H of higher
alkanes. This shows again the belated transition states compared to that of 1CH2
insertions [17]. The mean glide angle (θH1C2C1) decreases from primary to tertiary
C-H of the alkane (Table 3) and it gets reflected in the corresponding activation
barriers (Table 1). Further correlation is also noticed when the torsion angles
фC1H1C2H2 have been analyzed (Table 3). The quantum of charge transfer from alkane
to carbene in TSs increases with the increase in the number of alkyl substituents on
the C2 carbon (Table 3). It shows the inverse relationship between the barrier height
and quantum of charge transfer. The same trend is observed in the case of 1CCl2.
The NBO analyses of charge distribution in the transition state species give some
insight into the insertion reactivity. They show that the σCH Æ LP* interaction
between the C-H bond of alkane and LP* of the carbene carbon seems to give the

alkane unit to the inserting carbene moiety. The quantum of charge transfer from
alkane to carbene supporting the donor-acceptor interaction in the transition states for
all the insertion reactions have been collected in Tables 3 and 4. The inverse
relationship between the quantum of charge transfer and the activation barriers reveals
the fact that for the favorable insertion, the nucleophilicity of the alkane should have
been enhanced either sterically or electronically. This correlation holds good for all
the reactions analysed in this investigation. For example, in the case of 1CCl2 insertion

into iso-butane at MP2 level the barrier heights, 11.83 and 4.42 kcal/mol, for the
primary and tertiary C-H respectively correlate with the charge transfer of 0.357 and
0.404.
The reaction path for the insertion of 1CHCl into C-H of methane has been studied
by the IRC method at MP2 level (Fig. 2). In the transition state C2-H1 bond is
elongated by 10.9%. The stretching of the C2-H1 bond resulting in the C1-H1 bond
formation and the charge transfer from the methane to chlorocarbene are closely
linked together. Moreover the C1-H1 and the C1-C2 bond formations are found to be
asynchronous.
The same trend is followed also in the case of 1CCl2 (Fig. 3), the difference being
that the less electrophilic character of 1CCl2 compared to 1CHCl results in a
significantly reduced reactivity which is reflected in the higher activation barrier.

4 Summary
The singlet carbene insertion into the alkanes at the primary, secondary and tertiary CH bonds has been analyzed and the influence of chlorine on the transition states,
energetics, geometrical parameters etc., has been investigated both at B3LYP and
MP2 levels. Both the theories predict that the activation barrier is a function of the
degree of chlorination of carbene and the type of C-H into which insertion occurs.
Also, among the two different types of carbene moiety approaches, i.e., σ and π, the σ
approach is preferred over the π approach at both levels of theory as the π approach
leads to the eclipsed conformation which is a second order saddle point. Intrinsic
reaction coordinate analysis for the insertion in the case of 1CHCl and 1CCl2 into the
primary C-H of methane at MP2 has been carried out to show that the C1-H1 bond is
formed first followed by the C1-C2 bond. The NBO analyses have been done with a
view to analyzing the charge transfer processes during the insertion reactions.
