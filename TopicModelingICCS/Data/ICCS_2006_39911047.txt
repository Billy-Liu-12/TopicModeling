Abstract. NetSolve is a kind of grid middleware used for high performance
computing. In this article, the architecture and operational principle of NetSolve
are first analyzed, the limitations of the Netsolve system are pointed out, and then
Web Service Server and Server Proxy are put forward as the improvement of
NetSolve System to solve these limitations.

1 Introduction
Thanks to advance in hardware, networking infrastructure and algorithms, computing
intensive problems in many areas can now be successfully attacked. Various
mechanisms have been developed to perform computations across diverse platforms.
But until recently, there are still some difficulties in using high performance computer
and grid technology on a large scale.
NetSolve, underway at the University of Tennessee and at the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, is a project that makes use of distributed computational resources
connected by computer networks to efficiently solve complex scientific problems.
This article is meant to probe into the implementation of NetSolve and describe its
two extensions based on the super Cluster ZQ2000 of Shanghai University.

2 NetSolve
NetSolve is a client-server system that enables users to solve complex scientific
problems remotely. The system searches for computational resources on the network,
chooses the best one available, and solves a problem using retry for fault tolerance, and
returns the answers to the user. It has three components:
• Agent: The agent maintains a database of NetSolve servers along with their
capabilities and dynamic usage statistics for use in scheduling decisions. It attempts to
find the server that will service the request, balance the load amongst its servers, and
keep track of failed servers.

• Server: The NetSolve server is a daemon process that awaits client requests. It can
run on single workstations, clusters of workstations, SMPs, or MPPs. One key
component of the server is the ability to wrap software library routines into NetSolve
services by using an Interface Definition Language (IDL) .
• Client: The NetSolve client uses application programming interfaces (APIs) to
make a request to the NetSolve system, with the specific details required with the
request.

3 Limitations of the Netsolve System
However, NetSolve system doesn't have a universal interface, its interface protocol can
only be applied in the clients of NetSolve system. Therefore, other systems can't
communicate with NetSolve directly. Besides, it can't provide a friendly and
all-purpose interface for people who want to use the high performance computing
resources. Another limitation is: unless clients, agent, servers are located in the same
local network, real IP address is needed for them, as they communicate with each other
via IP address. But for security and limitation of IP resources concern, many clusters,
like ZQ2000 high performance cluster computer of Shanghai University, doesn't have
real IP address for each node of the cluster. Therefore, NetSolve clients from outside
the local network can't access any server on the node of ZQ2000.
To solve these limitations, we have two ways, the first is to make use of the Web
Services technology to add a Web Services server into the NetSolve system, and the
second is to add a server proxy into the NetSolve system.

4 Web Services Server
Web Services may use HTTP protocol, which can offer a friendly interface to facilitate
calling services and make real IP address no longer a necessity. After adding a Web
Services server into NetSolve, the work flow of the system changes as follows:

(1) Developing tools that supporting Web Services can be used to query the service
which exist in Web Services server. Service and its interface described in WSDL
format are returned to users from the server. After that, clients can call the service, just
like calling a common local process. (2) Clients send simple object access protocol
requests to Web Services server. On receiving the requests, the Web Services server
converts it into a service execution request to NetSolve system. NetSolve system can
then select the best server to execute the corresponding service. (3) NetSolve system
returns the results of a service to Web Services server after it is completed. Clients can
then get simple object access protocol responses described in XML format from the
Web Services server.
Web Services server turns services provided by NetSolve system into its services,
which is needed by Web Services call interface. The Web Services server and
NetSolve agent are installed on the same computer. All services provided by NetSolve
servers are registered in NetSolve agent.

5 Server Proxy
The common structure of super-computer is that they have one or several pre-servers
which possess real IP address and the rest fake IP address (local network IP address).
The pre-servers have double IP address like Gateway. If we run a Server Proxy on
pre-server or on Gateway, it can set up a bridge between the client and the interior
NetSolve servers.
Server proxy must run on the pre-server or gateway of super-computer. It can
ensure the success of connecting between client and server. First, client can connect to
server proxy, because pre-server has real IP. Meanwhile, pre-server and interior
server are in the same local area network (LAN), the pre-server can also connect to
the interior servers. Another problem is that all the data must pass through pre-server,
which may cause a bottleneck. Start up several server proxies in different pre-server,
and each server proxy manage a few of the interior servers can solve this problem.
Moreover, in order to improve the efficiency, we can set up a connection pool
between the server proxy and the interior servers.
Agent manages server proxy. It has the right to kill server proxy. Server proxy
registers to Agent at first time. If server proxy dies, Agent will delete the server
proxy’s information of the relevant interior servers.

6 Conclusions
These two kinds of improvement of NetSolve system have been successfully
applied in the ZQ2000 high performance cluster computer of Shanghai University.
There are many ways in which NetSolve should be further extended, we should
constantly improve our system to catch up with the fast development of numerical
computing.
