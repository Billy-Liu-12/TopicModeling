Abstract. An improved tool to explore the origin of human immunoglobulin
heavy chains, named Ab-origin, has been developed. It can analyze in detail the
V-D-J joints from the rearranged sequence by searching against germline
databases. In addition to the known information about antibody recombination,
appropriate score system and restriction of searching location are also
incorporated to improve computing performance. When compared with a newly
developed software SoDA, Ab-origin performed much better in both accuracy
and stability, with 2, 7 and 1 percent higher for V, D and J respectively. Though
only taking the human heavy chain for an example here, the algorithm also suits
for the analysis of all immunoglobulin and TCR sequences.
Keywords: antibody diversity, V(D)J recombination.

1 Introduction
To protect ourselves from intruders, our immune system produces antibody proteins
which are able to recognize and neutralize foreign substances, namely antigens. In
response to the different varieties of antigens encountered over a human’s lifetime, B
cells need to make thousands of millions of different antibodies deriving from the
limited immunologic information encoded in human genome[1]. It is estimated that
the human body can produce at least 108 different antibodies[2], as a homo-dimmer of
heavy and light peptide chains, each of them containing a unique variable region. In
contrast to the huge diversities of unique regions of antibodies, the variable region of
immunologic protein is only encoded by combination of three kinds of gene
segments: variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) fragments (V and J segments
only in the case of light chain). Taking heavy chain as an example, all the possible
variable regions is only encoded by gene groups of 51 V genes, 27 D genes and 6 J
genes in human chromosome 14 [2].
Obviously human beings has gained the most important and amazing
immunological mechanism to generate the vast diversity of antibodies during the long

history of evolution[1]. But how can the human bodies produce such a huge
number of antibodies from limited number of gene groups? Several mechanisms
in vivo have been revealed to answer this question, such as combinatorial V-(D)-J
genetic joining, junctional flexibility, somatic hypermutation and combinatorial
association of light and heavy chains[2]. It is notable that the random
recombination of the V, (D), J genetic segments plays the most critical role[1],
not only creating the diversity at level of 105 (10 3 for light chain), but also
providing the basic structural frame for further diversity developing of the
antibody variable region. In this sense, analysis of the V-(D)-J recombination
process could help to facilitate antibody engineering for potential therapeutic and
research applications.
With the accomplishment of human genome project, genetic information of
immunoglobulins (Igs) has been collected into public databases[3], which makes
bioinformatics analysis of V-D-J junction possible. Several tools have been developed
trying to trace back to genetic coding from the mature immunoglobulin sequences,
including some pioneer work which applied alignment methods[4, 5] or consecutive
matches for D segment matching[6]. Recently, a new tool based on dynamic
programming named SoDA was established, which is intended to process sequences
in batch[7].
Although these existing tools produced some positive results, their methods
were too complex. At the present time BLAST has been proved a very successful
and efficient tool for sequence alignment, which motivates us to achieve the task
with this handy and powerful tool. However, BLAST is a program for general
sequence analysis, while the antibody sequences have their own specialities, so it
is indispensable for us to assign these specialities to BLAST by setting appropriate
parameters.
In this paper, a similar tool named Ab-origin was setup based on BLAST[8]
algorithm, which has been widely accepted as a powerful tool for sequence alignment
that allows custom parameter settings according to specific situations. Ab-origin was
developed by JAVA language and run on Linux server. To better model the natural
process of antibody maturation induced by antigen-affinity, the unconfirmed events
such as D-D fusion[5, 9] and insertion/deletion during somatic hypermutations are
excluded after checking with related reference [2, 10].

2 Method
2.1 Germline Database
Sequences of V, D, J germline genes of human immunoglobulin heavy chains were
collected from IMGT[3] database. After removing the partial genes, the numbers
of the V, D and J alleles are 187, 34, and 12 respectively. V germline sequences
vary from 288 to 305 nucleotides in length, D vary from 11 to 37 and J from 48
to 63.

2.2 Principle
To our knowledge, V, D and J gene segments assemble through a site-specific
recombination reaction which is thought to be a random assortment[11]. Selections of
V, D and J segments during rearrangement process are independent. So, according to
the Bayes’ rule, there is
P(V,D,J|Q)=P(V)P(D)P(J)/P(Q) .

(1)

Where Q is the query sequence which is the target we need to analyze from mature
antibody. V, D, and J represent the three germline segments, respectively. P(V,D,J|Q)
is the probability of finding the correct V, D and J genes of the giving sequence
Q. This is the real case from germline to the mature antibody sequence in our body,
but when we decipher the mature sequence, the identification of the D region always
lies on the location of the V and J segments which you found in the query sequence.
So the formula changed to
P(V,D,J|Q)=P(V)P(D|V,J)P(J)/P(Q) .

(2)

When giving a observed sequence Q, P(Q) is a uniform. As a result, maximizing
P(V), P(D|V,J), P(J) separately will also maximize the conditional probability
P(V,D,J|Q). The probability of V, D and J was defined as a function of alignment
score which we referenced from BLAST[12].
2.3 Algorithm
2.3.1 Search for V and J
Ab-origin calls NCBI BLAST software to find the best V gene segment in the library
with the highest similarity to the query sequence. As we don’t consider the
insertion/deletion events, Ab-origin performs the alignment with a gap-forbidden
style, moreover, uses a smaller word size and a specific scoring system of +5 for
match and -6 for mismatch according to the similarity between germline and query
sequence. For J segment the best hit is also found using the same method as the V
segment. The probability was defined as the function of expected value getting from
the BLAST process[12].
2.3.2 Search for D
As illustrated above, D germline sequences are shorter than the V, J germlines and
vary largely in length. In the recombination, it was further shortened by deletions at
both ends and heavily modified by somatic hypermutaion as the whole D was located
in the CDR3 region. Because of its short length, false positive matches are of higher
probability[12], and in some cases, no hit is found at all. For this reason, BLAST
algorithm may not be effective enough to assess the D segment accurately; instead we
try to use an algorithm extended from BLAST.
We defined the searching space as Q(V_end-5,J_start+5). The algorithm to find D
germline in a query sequence is shown as following

366

X. Wang et al.

For all D germlines do
For every site n of query sequence from V_end-5 to
J_start+5 do
For every site from n to n+D_length do
If nucleotide of query sequence equals the one of
the germline sequence
score=score+5;
Else score=score-4;
End if.
End for.
End for.
End for.
Then the scores are sorted to find the best one. To filter the stochastic matches, the
hits with match number less than the half length of the D germline are discarded, and
a rigorous penalty score -4 is adopted.
2.3.3 Identification of N and P Region
We searched the short palindromic sequence (P region) at the exact margin of the
V, D and J region exactly reverse-complementary to the corresponding V, D and
J germline, respectively. During the V(D)J joining process, a region of non-template
nucleotides may be added by a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) catalyzed
reaction, namely N-region[2]. Ab-origin defined this region as the left parts of the
query sequence after previous assignments.
2.4 Validation
To test Ab-origin, a simulation program was developed to generate artificial
sequences of heavy chain variable regions. By randomly choosing V, D, J germline
segments, the program simulates V-(D)-J rearrangement and to be more vivid, it cuts
0 to 5 nucleotides randomly from either sides of the joints of V-D and D-J
combination due to the imprecise joining of the coding sequences [2]. Subsequently,
up to 15 N-nucleotides were randomly chosen, adding to both the D-J and V-D
joints. By introducing point mutations independently at each site, somatic
hypermutation is simulated with a transition rate twice as much as a transversion
rate[10]. Five different mutation rates were set ranging from 2% to 10% stepping 2%
corresponding to different phase of antibody affinity maturation[2]. At each mutation
rate, 1000 artificial sequences were generated. Finally, the sequences which contain
termination codon (TAG, TGA, TAA) at current open reading frame (ORF) were
removed.

3 Results and Discussions
Among the existing tools, only SoDA, IMGT/V-QUEST and VDJsolver can accept
batch submission. SoDA has shown several advantages compared to other tools such
as JOINSOLVER and V-QUEST, e.g. capacity of batch analysis, better results[7].
Thus we use simulated sequences to compare Ab-origin with SoDA for testing the
performance of Ab-origin.
After filtration, numbers of the remaining simulation sequences without
termination codons at five different mutation rates ranging from 2% to 10% stepping
2% are 353, 301, 243, 146, and 124 respectively. These sequences were analyzed by
Ab-origin and SoDA using the same germline database from IMGT[3]. The results
are shown in the Table1. At each mutation rate, Ab-origin identified more V, D, J
segments correctly than SoDA did. The average accuracy ratios for V, D and J
segments are up to 95%, 81% and 98%, respectively, compared to SoDA with 93%,
74% and 97%. Among which, the performance in determining D segment has the
most notable improvment. In 353, 301, 243, 146 and 124 cases of analysis, Ab-origin
correctly identified 292, 241, 193, 118 and 103 respectively, with an improvement of
7% in accuracy compared to SoDA.

* The numbers represent the correct results from two programs at five different mutation
rates. A correct inference means that the finding out gene segment was exactly the one we
used in simulation, even not allowing for mismatched alleles. a, Ab-origin.

In addition, we compared the error rates of the V, D and J segments at each
mutation rate (Figure1). The figure shows a higher error rate in the D segments than
that in V or J segments. The J segments were found to have the least error rates,
which is due to limited choices in the antibody combinations and consistent with the
previous studies[6, 7, 9]. Furthermore, all error rates of Ab-origin are lower than that
of SoDA’s at every mutation level (with an exception of the J segements at the
mutation rate 6), and the variance of error rates among each mutation rate is also
smaller (with standard deviation 0.016, 0.016 and 0.010 by Ab-origin and 0.023,
0.043 and 0.016 by SoDA for V, D and J segments, respectively). In summary, Aborigin has better performance in both accuracy and stability, in contrast SoDA tends
to have higher error rate concomitant with higher mutation rate which is also
mentioned in their publication[7].
In the real case of natural antibody maturation process, the imprecise
recombination of V-D and D-J segments may lead to the loss of several nucleotides in

the D extremity, and meanwhile the random insertion of N-nucleotides may occur
between the V-D and D-J joints. In addition, different D gene segments may have
identical sequences, such as IGHD5-5*01 and IGHD5-18*01, IGHD4-4*01 and
IGHD4-11*01, resulting in some unexpected inference mistakes. As a result, it’s very
difficult to recognize the D segment source. In contrast, the proportion of V and J
being influenced in the recombination is much smaller, making the error rates in
identifying D segment significantly higher than those of both V and J segments.

Fig. 1. Comparison of error rates between the results from Ab-origin (dashed line) and SoDA
(solid line) at five mutation rates

In general, Ab-origin has better performance at every mutation level in both
accuracy and stability; moreover, compared to SoDA it takes much shorter time to run
(data not shown). Its accuracy and stability is due to effective parameter settings,
while the fast running speed is duo to the optimization of BLAST in time and memory
costs.

4 Conclusions
An improved tool Ab-origin was developed to efficiently identify V, D, and J gene
segments from a rearranged antibody sequence by searching against germline
database using appropriate rules. To evaluate the tool, we compared Ab-origin and
SoDA with a set of artificial antibody sequences which were produced by simulating
the antibody maturation process. The results show Ab-origin not only finds more
correct V, D and J segments, with 2, 7 and 1 percent higher compared to SoDA
respectively, but also reduces the computational cost. Though this paper only take the
human heavy chain for an example, the algorithm established here also suits for the
analysis of all immunoglobulin and TCR sequences in human, even other mammals

which utilize similar antibody production mechanisms. Complementing the previous
tools for partitioning the rearranged immunoglobulin sequences, Ab-origin may
facilitate our understanding of antibody maturation process to provide the theoretical
backgrounds for the antibody engineering for therapeutic and research applications.
