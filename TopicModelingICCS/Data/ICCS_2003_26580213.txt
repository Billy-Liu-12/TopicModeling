Abstract. The paper discusses stochastic models of scalar and vector metocean
fields based on time varying Empirical Orthogonal Functions in space, and autoregressive time series models for the coefficients in the expansions. The models
are fitted to an extensive data set from the Barents Sea and verified by studying
field extreme value properties.

1 Introduction
Annual variations of spatial and temporal properties are characteristic features of most
metocean fields, and today several approaches for statistical analyses and modeling of
such fields have been developed. For example, in the papers of Dragan et al. [4] and
Lopatoukhin el al. [13] the time series of air and water temperature, river run-off,
wind speed, wave heights and sea level variations have been treated as Periodically
Correlated Stochastic Processes (PCSP). For spatial fields, periodical representations
based on Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOFs) have also been proposed by
Kim&Wu [10] and Kim&North, [11].
In the present paper we shall study the annual variations of metocean events as inhomogeneous random fields by constructing probabilistic description of their spatial and
annual variabilities. The aims of the current research have been to
 develop computationally efficient procedures for stochastic simulation of ensembles of annual variations of metocean fields;
 apply the above mentioned procedures to numerical investigations of the field
extremes.

2 The Data Set
All computations carried out by the stochastic models have been tested against an
extensive data set from the Barents Sea region. The input data set consists of fields of
atmospheric sea level pressure (SLP), wind speed (WS) and air temperature (AT)
from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data [9]. The input wave fields are numerically
obtained fields calculated by Wave Watch model [15]. A summary of sampling and
duration of the data sets are presented in Table 1.

3 Analysis of Inhomogeneous Metocean Fields
The second order inhomogeneity of a metocean field ζ (r , t ) is defined in terms of the
mean value mζ (r, t ) = Eζ ( r, t ) , and the covariance function

Kζ (r1 , r2 , t ,τ ) = E {ζ 0 (r1 , t )ζ 0 (r2 , t + τ )} ,

where

0

denotes the centering operation, X 0 = X − E ( X ) . Alternatively, the covari-

ance function may be defined as Kζ (r1 , , t ,τ ) , where r = ( x , y ) are the geographical
coordinates and = U2 − U1 the spatial lag. The large scale inhomogeneity is due to
variations in the spatial distribution of atmospheric or ocean forcing.
A preliminary analysis of the data shows that during winter, a low mean SLP,
mSLP (r, t ) , in the western part of the Barents sea is prevailing with an increasing pressure towards north, south and east. In summer, the situation is the opposite with the
highest pressure in the center of the sea, and dropping in all directions away from the
center. However, during all the year, the sea level pressure is below standard
(1013.2hPa). The standard deviation σ SLP = K SLP ( r, r, t , 0 )

1/ 2

of the SLP variations is

about 8 hPa in winter, and only 2.5–3.5 hPa in summer.
The standard deviation of the air temperature in the center of sea in winter is increasing from 2º to 6º toward north, whereas the variability in summer is fairly constant
around 2.5–3.5º.

We may conclude, based on the variations of mζ (r, t ) and σ ζ (r, t ) , that these metocean fields are inhomogeneous in space as well as non-stationary in time. In fact,
seasonal changes in the spatial patterns is a typical feature of the spatio-temporal variability of metocean fields. Since the physical interpretation of the full covariance
function is harder than for the functions mζ (r, t ) , σ ζ (r, t ) , this has lead us to consider
EOFs, which are calculated by means of the integral equation

∫ K ζ (r , r ) ϕ

(r2 )dr2 = λkt ϕ kt (r1 ) ,

(1)

Ω

where lkt are eigenvalues and Kζ (r1 , r2 )t = Kζ (r1 , r2 , t , 0) [12]. The first and second
EOFs for the SLP are shown in Fig. 1.
The covariance function for vector fields V (r, t ) like wind, currents, and temperature
gradients, is defined

K V (r , , t ,τ ) = E {9 0 (U, t ) ⊗ 9 0 ( ,τ )} ,

(2)

where ⊗ is the tensor (or outer) product of V 0 = V − m V [1]. Note that K V (r, )t is a
tensor,

 Ku

 K vu

K uv 

K v 

(3)

where Ku ,Kuv, Kv are auto- and cross-covariance functions of the components
( Vx , Vy ) of V in geographical coordinates. Similarly to Eqn. (2), vector EOFs
(VEOFs) may be computed by a tensor integral equation

∫K

(4)

where

k

= ϕ k L + ψ k M and

( i , j)

are the unit vectors in geographical coordinates [3].

The first VEOFs of wind speed for January and July are shown in Fig. 1. We observe
that not only the EOFs of sea level pressure, but also the VEOFs for the wind change
quite significantly from winter to summer.
The EOFs and VEOFs are both orthogonal with respect to the inner product defined
by the covariance function, and may therefore be used as basis functions for an orthogonal expansion of the fields. Thus, the field ζ (r, t ) may be expanded as

ζ (r, t ) − m(r, t ) = ∑ ak (t )ϕ kt (r, t )

(5)

k

The basis functions ϕ kt (r, t ) are periodic in time, and may thus be considered as generalizations of the component representation of a field discussed in Dragan et al.[4],

ζ (t ) = ∑ ξ k (t ) exp(−iΛ k t )

If we estimate EOFs ϕ kt (r ) on the basis of the averaged spatial covariance function

over the year, we obtain an all months basis ϕ k ( r ) . The annual variations will then

only be manifested in the coefficients ak ( t ) of Eqn. (5), as illustrated for the SLP
auto- and cross correlation functions K ak ( τ ) in Fig. 2. It is seen that the autocorrelation in ak ( t ) is much smaller when we use the seasonal EOFs. Moreover, in that case,
the cross correlation between the different time functions ak ( t ) become negligible.
An estimate of the convergence of the series in Eqn. (5) for SLP, air temperature,
wave heights and wind speed, calculated by the mean of the ratio λi / ∑ k λk is shown
in Table 2.

It seen from Table 2, that the first term in Eqn. (5) holds 40–85% of the total variance
of the field values. A sum of the first three terms in (5) holds about 85–95% of the
variance. Let us also note that different orthogonal polynomial, e.g., Chebyshev, Legendre, spherical harmonics etc. may be used as basis functions in Eqn. (5) [2]. However, the convergence of the EOFs expansion is the best in terms of the second-order
metric defined by the covariance function.

4 The Stochastic Simulation Procedure
Taking into account Table 2, the relation in Eqn. (5) may be written as

ζ (r, t ) = m(r, t ) + ∑ ak (t )ϕ kt (r, t ) + ε (r, t )

(7)

k

where N is a representative number of terms, and ε (r, t ) is residual white noise (both
in space and time). The noise variance is typically not more than 20% of σ ζ2 . Bearing
in mind the type of autocovariance functions K ak ( τ ) shown in Fig. 3, and ignoring the

218

A.V. Boukhanovsky et al.

cross correlations defined by K ak a j ( τ ) , the stochastic processes ak(t) may be presented
in the form of uncorrelated scalar autoregressive models [7]:
p

ak ( t ) = ∑ Φ (j k )ak ( t − j ) + δ ( k ) ( t )
j =1

(8)

Here the Φ (j k ) coefficients are calculated from the covariance function K ak (τ ) , and

δ ( k ) ( t ) is a constant variance Gaussian white noise, only dependent on k. The relations (7) and (8) constitute a stochastic model of the inhomogeneous (by r) and periodically correlated (by t) random field ζ (r, t ) .

Fig. 2. Auto- (a,b) and cross (b,d) covariance functions (AKF, CKF) for the expansion coefficients in Eqn. (7) of SLP field by periodic basis (a,b) and averaged by months basis (c,d). For
the AKF, 1– 3 denotes the serial number of the coefficient. For the CKF, 1 corresponds to (i=2,
j=1), 2 to (i=3,j=1), and 3 to (i=3,j=2). Moreover, 4 are the 90% limits confidence interval for
the estimates.

The functions ak(t) and ε (r, t ) in Eqn. (7) enable us to regard it both as a regression
and a factor model [8]. The terminology of multidimensional statistical analysis is not
always suitable for the analysis of random processes and fields. E.g., the model in
Eqn. (7) is known as a regression, but not as a factor model, although ak(t) are random
functions, and, moreover, {Φ i( k ) } are calculated by means of K ak ( τ ) . The functions

Stochastic Simulation of Inhomogeneous Metocean Fields. Part I: Annual Variability

219

ϕ kt (r ) , calculated by Eqns. (1) and (3), are known as EOFs, and not as the factor
loadings.

Fig. 3. Stochastic simulation of annual variation of inhomogeneous metocean fields: general
algorithm.

The general algorithm of the stochastic model identification and simulation is shown
in Fig. 3. The model identification starts by estimating {m(r, t )} and {ϕ kt (r )} for a
discrete set of grid points on a monthly basis. By expanding the fields into EOF series
by means of {ϕ kt (r )} , the remaining time variations is reduced to the time series of
scalar coefficients {ak (t )} . The coefficient time series, which now are stationary, are
then in turn fitted to suitable autoregressive models by invoking the covariance functions K ak (τ ) . The estimation of autoregressive coefficients Φ (j k ) in Eqn. (8) for each
time series ak ( t ) is discussed in numerous places, e.g. in [7]. Finally, the variance of
the white noise field ε (r, t ) is calculated.
When using the model for simulations, an ensemble of independent realizations of
ak ( t ) for the time span [ 0,T ] of the computations, is first produced by Eqn. (8).
Then, the realizations of the full spatiotemporal metocean fields are obtained by

A.V. Boukhanovsky et al.

220

means substituting of the simulated series of ak ( t ) into Eqn. (7) and adding the white
noise term.
The result of the simulation procedure is the set of the simulated metocean fields
ζ (r, t ) or V (r, t ) in a discrete set of grid points rij = ( xi , y j ) and at discrete times,

{tn } .

5 Verification and Extreme Value Analysis
The developed simulation procedure may be verified and tested by considering the
problem of spatial extremes. In practice, due to inhomogeneity of the fields, there
arise questions of joint extremes in two or more spatial points. A Gaussian kernel
estimate [14] of the joint distribution of mean monthly minima of SLP in the SW and
E parts of Barents Sea is presented in Table 3 (left). This estimation was obtained
from the initial data set given in Table 1. It is seen that although the two parts of the
sea are more than 1000 km from each other, the correlation is rather high (about 0.7).
Since extreme value properties were not considered as a part of the model identification, the extreme values predictions by the model provide independent model verification. In the right part of the Table 3, a similar Gaussian kernel estimate of joint SLP
minima in the same points have been obtained from simulations using Eqns. 7 and 8. It
is observed that the maxima of the joint probability are located on the main diagonal,
and this reflects the overall correlation of the sea level pressure field. The differences
between probabilities are insignificant. Even the largest difference be1
tween pi(, j) = 31.5% and pij(2) = 17.1% is inside the 90% confidence interval.

Annual extremes, calculated from monthly mean values of water temperature and
salinity, sea level, wave heights, may in different years be observed in different
months. Thus, the distribution for the annual extreme, FY ( x) , will then a mixture of
distributions for the monthly mean Fi ( x) [13] with the weights ri – the probabilities of
appearance of Xmin or Xmax in the month i.
We may now pose two questions:

Stochastic Simulation of Inhomogeneous Metocean Fields. Part I: Annual Variability

221

Does the distribution in Eqn. (9) extend from a single point extreme to a field extreme?
Does the model in Eqns. (7,8) reproduce both the distribution (9) and its field modification?
Table 4 answers these questions in the affirmative. We observe a quite good agreement between sample and simulated extremes over the entire field. E.g., from the data
only in 7.5% of the mean monthly temperatures in the Barents Sea is below –39º. By
the model simulations, this value has changed to 5.5%, which, however, is well inside
90% confidence limits. A similar agreement is observed for the probability ri of
monthly extremes. E.g., the annual lowest air temperature over the Barents Sea occurs
in January 40% of the time, whereas this occurs 45% of the time in the simulations,
again well inside the 90% confidence limits.

6 Conclusions
This paper has shown that computational multivariate statistics of spatio-temporal
fields may be used for describing the metocean regime in seas and oceans.
By applying field expansions in terms of periodical EOFs and VEOFs, it has been
possible to develop stochastic models which are field generalizations of PCSPs.
The models may be applied to simulate ensembles of time varying metocean fields
like SLP, WS, AT, and sea waves.
Investigation of spatial and temporal features of annual extremes of measured and
simulated metocean fields may be used for independent model verification. Further
applications will be discussed in a separate paper in these proceedings.
