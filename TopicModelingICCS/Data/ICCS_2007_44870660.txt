Abstract. The purpose of Fast Handovers for Mobile IPv6(FMIPv6) is
to reduce the overall handover latency resulting from standard Mobile
IPv6(MIPv6) procedures. The standard FMIPv6 procedure comprises
layer 2 and layer 3 handover procedures, and these are performed serially. This causes a long latency problem which is not negligible for
real-time service such as Voice over IP(VoIP) over IEEE 802.16e network. We revise FMIPv6 messages to reduce the overall latency on handover over IEEE 802.16e networks. A Layer 2 handover message gives
layer 3 handover messages a piggyback, and so the mobile node(MN)
which is operated by our scheme, is able to ﬁnish overall handover earlier than standard MIPv6 and FMIPv6. We evaluate the performance
of the scheme by analyzing the overall cost. Compared to FMIPv6 handover scheme, the proposed scheme gains about 27% of improvement.

Introduction

The advent of WiBro in Korea let people aware of Broadband Wireless Access(BWA) service. And that have people think it is going to be able to access
the Internet at anywhere no matter what vehicle they are riding on. It is certain
that the concept of services of the Internet in the future will be totally diﬀerent
from today’s one. As the features of the Internet such as data rates and error
rates are improved, the services on the Internet are changed as well. When we
talk about the applications over the Internet now, we cannot talk about those
without real-time services. It is extremely important to reduce handover latency
for the real-time service applications.
In order to support mobility for the Internet services, the Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) proposed Mobile IPv6[2]. The IETF again proposed
FMIPv6[3] and Hierarchical Mobile IPv6(HMIPv6)[4] to reduce the latency for
handovers. It is however not enough to satisfy real-time traﬃc yet. We propose an
improved fast handover scheme (IFH) to lower the handover latency, by modifying the FMIPv6 messages and messages for network re-entry procedure on IEEE
802.16e network[1]. The main idea of FMIPv6 is tunneling from Previous Access Router(PAR) to New Care-of Address(NCoA), so the packets which may be

lost in standard MIPv6 operation can be preserved. At the same time, the MN
becomes able to receive packets sent by Correspondent Node(CN), as soon as
the MN sends Fast Neighbor Advertisement message(FNA). When the time for
tunneling gets longer and longer the packets coming through the tunnel become
a burden to the New Access Router(NAR), since the NAR must proxy those
packets until it receives Fast Neighbor Advertisement(FNA) message from MN.
We focus on those two points (i.e., shorten overall latency and time for tunneling) and propose the IFH scheme to solve those two problems at the same
time.
This document is organized as follows. In section 2, FMIPv6 procedure over
the IEEE 802.16e network and few eﬀorts to reduce the handover latency on
IEEE 802.16e and IEEE 802.11 are presented. In section 3, we describe the
improved handover scheme(IFH). We set up a simpliﬁed model to analyze the
costs and beneﬁts of using IFH, in section 4. Finally, in section 5, we conclude
discussion with future study.

Fast Handovers for MIPv6 over IEEE 802.16e

MN cannot stay at only one Base Station(BS), and hence obviously it need to
perform handover to neighbor BS. Fig.1 shows an example of handover in IEEE
802.16e network.
For FMIPv6 procedure over the IEEE 802.16e, Serving BS broadcasts MOB
NBR-ADV message periodically which has information about its neighbor BS[5].
If the MN found a new BS(NBS) in MOB NBR-ADV message, it may perform
scanning to measure the signal power of the NBS. Once the MN decides handover to the new neighbor BS, the MN and the Previous BS(PBS) exchange
MOB MNHO-REQ/MOB BSHO-REP messages to initiate handover. On reception of MOB BSHO-REP from PBS, the MN exchanges Fast Binding Update(FBU) and Fast Binding Acknowledgement(FBAck) messages with PAR.
Receiving FBU, the PAR establishes a tunnel to NCoA with the NAR by exchanging Handover Initiate(HI) and Handover Acknowledgement(HAck) messages. Before send HAck, the NAR veriﬁes availability of NCoA. Layer 2 of the
MN sends MOB HO-IND to PBS as a ﬁnal indication of handovers, when the
MN receives FBAck from PAR. Then, the MN closes the connection with PBS
and performs network re-entry procedure(Hard handover). When the network

re-entry procedure is completed, MN issues FNA message to NAR via NBS.
As soon as NAR receives FNA message, NAR delivers MN the buﬀered packets sent via tunnel from PAR. The network re-entry procedure comprises three
phases roughly. In the ﬁrst phase, MN starts synchronization with new downlink,
ranging and synchronization with uplink. The ﬁrst phase is all about adjusting
uplink/downlink parameters and timing oﬀsets. The second phase is authorization phase to protect the MN from malicious node spooﬁng. As the last phase,
MN and NBS perform re-registration process.

The Proposed Scheme

We propose a method, called Improved Fast Handovers for MIPv6(IFH), to
reduce the overall handover latency and the time for tunneling between the
PAR and the NCoA. We perceive that BS has an IP address, which means the
BS can manipulate Layer 3 messages. We consider that MN sends few Layer 3
messages, i.e. Binding Update message to Home Agent, Home Test Init(HoTI)
message, and Care-of Test Init(CoTI) message in encapsulated form in one of
the Layer 2 handover messages.

For security consideration, it is regarded that it should be proceeded right
after Layer 2 authorization phase ﬁnished. With the IFH, the MN can register
its NCoA to Home Agent(HA) and CN earlier than the FMIPv6. In doing the
IFH, the time for maintaining tunneling between PAR to NCoA would also
decrease, which makes unburden NAR more quickly.

Performance Evaluation
System Modeling

We set up the network model for our paper as Fig.3. In our system model, we
consider a,b,c and d as one hop distance. Any connection to the outside of PAR
subnet is considerd to have ﬁve hop distance except e. We assume that NAR
and PAR are connected to each other in Hierarchical manner, so we consider
connection e has two hop distance. We assume that the CN generates and sends
data packets to the MN at a mean rate λ. The cost for transmitting a data
packet is l times bigger than that for signaling packet, where l = ldata /lsignal .
ldata is the average length of data packets, and lsignal is the average length of
signaling packets. The delay to process packets in any node is very short comparing to the transport delay, and IFH and FMIPv6 have almost same amount of
packet processing. So we ignore the packet processing delay for this performance
evaluation.

Cost Analysis

In this paper, we compare the IFH with the FMIPv6 to show the improved
performance of the IFH. We deﬁne overall handover latency as
Coverall = Csignal + Cdata ,

(1)

where Csignal is the sum of costs to transport signaling messages, and Cdata is
the sum of costs to transport data packets. The FMIPv6 procedure comprises
six phases[6] as shown in Fig.4. Tf ast is the delay for MN to acquire and verify the NCoA, and during this time the tunnel between the PAR and NCoA
is established. TL2 is the delay for Layer 2 handover. TIP is the delay to send
FNA message. THABU is the delay for the Binding Update(BU) and the Binding Acknowledgement(BA) messages to HA. TRR is the delay during the Return
Routability Procedure[3], and TCN BU is the delay to send the BU and the BA
messages to CN.

The signaling cost of the FMIPv6 is deﬁned as

= Csig

f ast+Csig L2+Csig IP +Csig HABU +Csig RR+Csig CN BU .

The cost to transport data packets is deﬁned as
Cdata

FH

= Psuccess · λ · Ctunnel F H · Ttunnel
+ Pf ail · λ · {(Closs · Tloss )

FH

+ (Creactive · Treactive )}.

(3)

The Psuccess denote the probability of MN to perform FMIPv6 in predictive
mode successfully, and the Pf ail denote the probability of failure as well[11].
According to [3], there is no certain guarantee that the packets sent by CN
would not be lost, in case of failure of the predictive mode. Hence we assume those packets would be lost and are needed to be sent again. Those
Closs and Tloss are about the lost packets because of the failure of the predictive mode. Creactive and Treactive are about the retransmission and the reactive
mode. The Ctunnel F H is the cost for the CN to send data packets through the
tunnel between PAR and NCoA, and it can be calculated by ltimes of the signaling cost between the CN and the NCoA. And the Ttunnel F H can be described as
Ttunnel

FH

= TL2 + TIP + THABU + TRR + TCN BU .

(4)

In case of failure, the Closs can be calculated by l times of the signaling cost
between the CN and the PCoA, and the Tloss can be described as
Tloss = TL2 + TIP + TF BU

reactive

+ TN otice ,

(5)

where TF BU reactive is the time for the FBU from the NAR to the PAR, which
was encapsulated in FNA message. TN otice is the time to let the PAR aware of
the Handover of the MN.
Creactive is same as Ctunnel F H , because the path of the data packets is same as
the path of the predictive mode. Treactive is given by
Treactive = TL2 + THandover

Init reactive

+ THABU + TRR + TCN BU ,

(6)

where THandover Init reactive is the time for FNA, FBU, HI, HAck and FBAck
messages of the reactive mode of FMIPv6.

Fig.5 depicts the IFH in time line manner, and it is similar to the time line
of the FMIPv6. The two phases, THABU and TRR however, start at the same
time. Those two phases begin right after the authentication phase of Layer 2.
The overall handover latency of the fast handover is reduced by the IFH as
much as TReduced . The signaling cost and the cost to transport data packets
are calculated in the same manner as we do for the FMIPv6. The Ttunnel F H
however is replaced by
Ttunnel

= TL2 + max (TIP , TRR − Tre−registration ) + TCN BU

The rest of the cost to transport data packets is same as FMIPv6.

Numerical Results and Analysis

In our paper, we leverage formulas derived from experiential communication delay model. In the scenario used for modeling, a CN, a HA and ARs are connected
to a wired network. The network consists of switched 10 Mbps Ethernet LAN
segments, IP routers and the Bellcore network backbone. Regression analysis of
the collected data for wired network produce
Twired−RT (h, k) = 3.63k + 3.21(h − 1) ,

(8)

where k is the length of the packet in KB, h is the number of hops[9]. We
assume Twireless−RT as 10ms, because a unit of time frame is 5ms in case of
Wibro[8],[10].
The variation of a signaling and a data packet with variation of λ. The
signaling cost is a constant value, so it is not aﬀected by the value of λ. The IFH
needs less signaling cost than the standard FMIPv6, since IFH embeds three
Layer 3 handover messages, i.e. BU for HA, HoTI and CoTI messages, inside of
the Layer 2 handover signaling message. The data cost in two diﬀerent schemes
increases in proportion to λ.
Cost ratio with variation of λ. Both overall cost for the FMIPv6
(Coverall F MIP v6 ) and overall cost for the IFH(Coverall IF H ) are calculated by
(1). The relationship of overall cost for the FMIPv6(Coverall F MIP v6 ) and overall
cost for the IFH(Coverall IF H ) are illustrated as Fig.6.

In Fig.6 describes the variation of cost ratio against the FMIPv6, respectively
when the radius of a cell is 1km. These two numerical expressions (9) and (10)
show a small diﬀerence of the cost ratio between pedestrian speed and vehicle
speed. This shows that IEEE 802.16e network is designed to support especially
the mobility of the MN. So the probability of predictive mode of FMIPv6 is not
aﬀected by the speed of the MN. The mean of cost ratio of (9) and (10) is about
0.73, and hence we claim that our scheme (IFH) improves the performance of
FMIPv6 by 27%.

Conclusions and Discussion

It is very obvious that we need to solve technical problems about delays of
MIPv6 and FMIPv6, prior to deploy those two techniques over IEEE 802.16e
network. The service over IEEE 802.16e network would require the MN to support seamless real-time connectivity. Using only FMIPv6 however, is not enough
for the seamless connectivity yet. We propose an Improved Fast Handovers(IFH)
to reduce the overall latency on the handover and to unburden the PAR earlier.
We proved the IFH achieves improved performance by comparison against
FMIPv6. Compared to the standard FMIPv6, the IFH acquired 27% improvement. For more realistic evaluation of our scheme, we plan to investigate with
the Wibro equipments about the eﬀect of the IFH through various applications.
