Abstract. The various kinds of modelling of environment-industry systems in
environmental management are considered. The system dynamics models of
interaction between industrial production and environment are developed. The
basic model of the main factors and links is upgraded to the detailed models,
which may be applied directly in the management process. The models are
applied in the system of various levels, including model of Moscow city and
machine-building enterprise. It’s shown that the modelling provides the
necessary information for the support the decision-making.

1 Introduction
The modern approach to supply the sustainable development of industry relates to the
concept of the environmental management which is presented in the international
standards serial ISO 14000 [1, as an example of standard from serial]. The practical
application of the environmental management needs the information support. This
information may be obtained from the mathematical modelling of various systems.
International standard ISO 14001 is focused specifically onto environmental
management. The Life Cycle Assessment methodology [1] gives the inventory panel
of the sources of environmental load. To reach the integrated indicator of the
environmental load in the terms of environmental damage, the next stages of
modelling have to follow the first inventory stage – Fig.1 [2]:

-

Fate analysis (links from emissions to concentrations);
Effect analysis (links from concentrations to health effects, resources and
ecosystems changes);
- Damage analysis (from effects to assessment of damages of human health,
resources, and ecosystems);
- LC eco-indicator determination through damages normalization and weighting.
Fate, effects, and damage analysis is supported by specific kinds of modelling.
But the management procedures need the special system models, what can provide the
information for the factual management [3]. These models are developed in the
report.
The system dynamics modelling software VENSIM PLE by Ventana Systems
Inc. (academic version) [4] is applied for model computer realization.

Basic Model of Environment-Industry Interaction

The basic model (model 3) was designed to study the main factors and links between
them. It’s also used for development of the more realistic model versions.
The model is presented in Fig.2. It includes two parts: environmental damage and
economy of enterprise. In this model the environmental damage is presented by the
total pollution flow directed into environment. The enterprise pays the environmental
taxes what are proportional to the difference between real pollutant flow and
normative quota of pollution. The coefficient of proportionality is the environmental
taxes rate.

The charge of the benefit after paying the environmental taxes may be spent for
the internal investments in the production. To decrease the pollution flow and
environmental taxes the part of the benefit is directed to the cleaning technologies. So,
the major feedback loop of the model is the following one:
Enterprise fund – production – investments in cleaning technologies – level of
cleaning production – pollutant flow – environmental taxes – internal investments –
enterprise fund .
This feedback loop is positive (Fig.2), and to control the system the following
negative feedback loop is included:
Production – investments in cleaning technologies – production after investments in
cleaning technologies – internal investments – enterprise fund – production .
The example of simulation with the basic model is shown in Fig.3. The time step
of the model is one year, the model period is 6 years, and the simulated enterprise is
successful in decreasing of the environmental pollution.

The nontrivial results may be obtained from simulation with the next version of the
basic model with more complicated definition of the environmental taxes. The model
(model 4) is presented in Fig.4.

Fig. 4. Model 4 with two-steps limits of pollution

In model 4 the environmental taxes depend on the level of the factual
pollutants flow in comparison with the allowed quota or normative limit. If the level
of the factual pollutants flow exceeds the normative limit the environmental taxes rate
five times more than if not.
Model also utilizes the more complicated strategy of enterprise: the investments
in the new technologies increase depending on the results of decrease of pollutant
flow in the previous year.

As the simulation result the oscillations of the factors were obtained – fig. 5. The
period of oscillations is 3 years. The explanation of the pollutant flow periodic
variations is clear. If in the previous year the pollutant flow is lower than quota, the
management of enterprise cut the investments in cleaning technologies in the current
year what result in the increase of the pollutant flow in the next year. The amplitude
of the oscillations increases with time in relation with the increase of production.
The approach to improve the situation may be found by simulation also. The
problem is to find the minimal investments volume in the cleaning technologies in the
years with allowed pollutant flows what supports the sustainable development of
enterprise.
The found optimum is shown in Fig.6. The simulation has been carried out for the
same boundary and initial conditions. The other factors like enterprise fund,
production, and environmental taxes show the similar dynamic behavior. The
oscillations are obtained in all cases when the initial pollutant flow is close to limit.

The environmental damage to human health is measured in DALYs (Disability
Adjusted life Years) scale. The model provides two possibilities of control. The first
approach is basing on the simulation the traditional control when factual
concentration of the substance is compared with normative limits. The concentration
of Ch VI oxides in air, drinking water (drw) and food may be applied. To define the
concentrations in water and food the fate factors (F) are used [2].

The second approach is the management basing on the system simulation with the
main objective to reach the adopted decrease of the environmental damage. The
human health damage is estimated using the unit-risk concept.
The results of simulation for the model of “close Moscow” (example) are shown
in Fig.8. Only in one simulated scenario (mod_81E_trad) the environmental damage
decreases effectively with time.
The model includes 75 variables and factors, and the optimal values of the
variables with initial values and constant factors for the system management may be
obtained by simulation.

4 Conclusions
The system dynamics modelling of the environment-industry systems can provide the
information what is necessary for the management procedures. The modelling
approach may be applied for the system of various dimensions in space and time. The
simulation of scenarios supports the finding of the optimal decision.
