Abstract. We present a lattice Boltzmann model to describe the spreading of droplets on topologically patterned substrates. We apply it to
model superhydrophobic behaviour on surfaces covered by an array of
micron-scale posts. We ﬁnd that the patterning results in a substantial
increase in contact angle, from 110o to 156o .

Introduction

A droplet in contact with a substrate will try to spread to an equilibrium shape
determined by Young’s law which describes the balance of surface tensions. There
are many parameters which aﬀect this process. For example surface disorder in
the form of chemical or topological heterogeneities can pin a droplet or change
its ﬁnal shape. This has usually been viewed as a nuisance in experiments and
applications. However with the advent of microfabrication techniques it is becoming possible to harness controlled surface topologies to explore new physical
phenomena.
A beautiful example of this, inspired by the leaves of the lotus plant, is a
superhydrophobic substrate. The angle θ between the tangent plane and the
droplet is usually known as the contact angle. The higher the contact angle the
more repellent the surface. There are applications, for example raincoats and
windscreens, where repellent surfaces are highly desirable. Surface coatings and
chemical modiﬁcations of the substrate are common ways to increase the contact
angle but it is diﬃcult to achieve an angle of more than 120o . However surfaces
patterned with posts on a micron length scale allow contact angles of 160o to be
reached [1,2].
The aim of this paper is to present a lattice Boltzmann algorithm which
can be used to investigate the behaviour of droplets on topologically patterned
substrates. Lattice Boltzmann is a particularly appropriate approach in that it
solves the Navier Stokes equations but also inputs the thermodynamic information such as surface tensions needed to describe the behaviour of droplets.
Moreover its natural length scale, for ﬂuids such as water, is of order microns
where much of the exciting new physics is expected to appear. The method has
already shown its capability in dealing with spreading on surfaces with chemical
patterning [3].
In section 2 we summarise the algorithm and, particularly, describe the new
thermodynamic and velocity boundary conditions needed to treat surfaces with

topological patterning. In section 3 we present results for a substrate patterned
by an array of posts. The patterning leads to a considerable increase in contact
angle. Finally we discuss directions for future work using this approach.

The Mesoscopic Model

We consider a liquid-gas system of density n(r) and volume V . The surface of
the substrate is denoted by S. The equilibrium properties are described by the
free energy
κ

ψb (n) + (∂α n) dV +
ψc (n) dS.

ψb (n) is the free energy in the bulk. We choose a Van der Waals form
2

ψb (n) = pc (νn + 1) (νn2 − 2νn + 3 − 2βτw )

(2)

where νn = (n − nc )/nc , τw = (Tc − T )/Tc and pc = 1/8, nc = 7/2 and Tc = 4/7
are the critical pressure, density and temperature respectively and β is a constant
typically equal to 0.1. The bulk pressure
pb = pc (νn + 1)2 (3νn2 − 2νn + 1 − 2βτw ).

(3)

The derivative term in equation (1) models the free energy associated with
an interface. κ is related to the surface tension. ψc (ns ) = φ0 − φ1 ns + · · · is the
Cahn surface free energy [4] which controls the wetting properties of the ﬂuid.
The lattice Boltzmann algorithm solves the Navier-Stokes equations for this
system. Because interfaces appear naturally within the model it is particularly
well suited to looking at the behaviour of moving drops.
2.1

The Lattice Boltzmann Algorithm

The lattice Boltzmann approach follows the evolution of partial distribution functions fi on a regular, d-dimensional lattice formed of sites r. The label i denotes
velocity directions and runs between 0 and z. DdQz + 1 is a standard lattice
topology classiﬁcation. The D3Q15 lattice we use here has the following velocity
vectors vi : (0, 0, 0), (±1, ±1, ±1), (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1) in lattice units
as shown in ﬁg. 1.
The lattice Boltzmann dynamics are given by
fi (r + ∆tvi , t + ∆t) = fi (r, t) +

(f (r, t) − fi (r, t))
τ i

(4)

where ∆t is the time step of the simulation, τ the relaxation time and fieq the
z
equilibrium distribution function which is a function of the density n = i=0 fi
and the ﬂuid velocity u, deﬁned through the relation

where ∆r is the lattice spacing and C2 and C4 are coeﬃcients related to the

a D3Q15 lattice (see [6] for more details).
It can be shown [7] that equation (4) reproduces the Navier-Stokes equations
of a non-ideal gas if the local equilibrium functions are chosen as

Wetting Boundary Conditions

The major challenge in dealing with patterned substrates is to handle the boundary conditions correctly. We consider ﬁrst wetting boundary conditions which

Mesoscopic Modelling of Droplets on Topologically Patterned Substrates

control the value of the density derivative and hence the contact angle. For ﬂat
substrates a boundary condition can be set by minimising the free energy (1) [4]
ˆs · ∇n = −

φ1
κ

(9)

where ˆs is the unit vector normal to the substrate. It is possible to obtain an
expression relating φ1 to the contact angle θ as [6]

(10)

where α = cos−1 (sin2 θ) and the function sign returns the sign of its argument.
Equation (9) is used to constrain the density derivative for sites on a ﬂat part
of the substrate. However, no such exact results are available for sites at edges
or corners. We work on the principle that the wetting angle at such sites should
be constrained as little as possible so that, in the limit of an increasingly ﬁne
mesh, it is determined by the contact angle of the neighbouring ﬂat surfaces.
For edges (labels 9 − 12 in ﬁg. 2) and corners (labels 1 − 4) at the top of
the post each site has 6 neighbours on the computational mesh. Therefore these
sites can be treated as bulk sites.

At bottom edges where the post abuts the surface (labels 13 − 16 in ﬁg. 2)
density derivatives in the two directions normal to the surface (e.g. x and z for
sites labeled 13) are calculated using

where the middle term constrains the density derivative in the appropriate direction x or y.
At bottom corners where the post joins the surface (labels 5 − 8 in ﬁg. 2)
density derivatives in both the x and y directions are known. Therefore these
sites are treated as planar sites.
2.3

Velocity Boundary Conditions

We impose a no-slip boundary condition on the velocity. As the collision operator
(the right hand side of equation (4)) is applied at the boundary the usual bounceback condition is not appropriate as it would not ensure mass conservation [8].
Indeed after applying equation (4) there are missing ﬁelds on the substrate
sites because no ﬂuid has been propagated from the solid. Missing ﬁelds are

determined to fulﬁll the no-slip condition given by equation (5) with u = 0. This
does not uniquely determine the fi ’s. For most of the cases (i.e. 1 − 20) arbitrary
choices guided by symmetry are used to close the system. This is no longer
possible for sites 21 − 27 where four asymmetrical choices are available. Selecting
one of those solutions or using a simple algorithm which chooses one of them at
random each time step leads to very comparable and symmetrical results. Hence
we argue that an asymmetrical choice can be used. Possible conditions, which
are used in the results reported here, are listed in table 1.
The conservation of mass is ensured by setting a suitable rest ﬁeld, f0 , equal
to the diﬀerence between the density of the missing ﬁelds and the one of the
ﬁelds entering the solid after collision.

Results

As an example we consider here the superhydrophobic behaviour of droplet
spreading on a substrate patterned by square posts arranged as in ﬁg. 3.
The size of the domain is Lx × Ly × Lz = 80 × 80 × 80 and the height, spacing
and width of posts are h = 5, d = 8 and w = 4 respectively. A spherical droplet
of radius R = 30 is initially centered around the point (x; y; z) = (41; 41; 36). The
contact angle θinput = 110o is set on every substrate site. The surface tension
and the viscosity are tuned by choosing parameters κ = 0.002 and τ = 0.8
respectively. The liquid density nl and gas density ng are set to nl = 4.128 and
ng = 2.913 and the temperature T = 0.4.
Fig. 4 shows the ﬁnal state attained by the droplet for diﬀerent substrates
and initial conditions. For comparison ﬁg. 4(a) shows a planar substrate. The
equilibrium contact angle is θa = 110o = θinput as expected [6]. In ﬁg. 4(b) the
substrate is patterned and the initial velocity of the drop is zero. Now the contact
angle is θb = 156o , a demonstration of superhydrophobic behaviour. Fig. 4(c)

reports an identical geometry but a drop with an initial impact velocity. Now the
drop is able to collapse onto the substrate and the ﬁnal angle is θb = 130o . These
angles are compatible with those in [2] where similar parameters are considered.
For the parameter values used in these simulations the state with the droplet
suspended on the posts has a slightly higher free energy than the collapsed state.
It is a metastable state and the droplet needs an impact velocity to reach the
true thermodynamic ground state. For macroscopic drops gravity will also be
important in determining whether the drop remains suspended on top of the
posts. Extrand has predicted the minimum post perimeter density necessary for
a droplet to be suspended [9]. A next step will be to add gravity to the simulation
to compare to his prediction.
Superhydrophobicity occurs over a wide range of d, the distance between the
posts. For suspended drops of this size and d ≥ 12 the drop resides on a single
post and the contact angle is 170o . For d < 12 the contact angle lies between
148o and 156o with the range primarly due to the commensurability between
drop radius and post spacing.
It is of course also of interest to look further at the dynamics of the spreading.
The droplet random motion reported in [2] and the bouncing back of droplets
on nanotubes [10] pose many interesting directions for future research.
