Abstract
In this paper, the phenomenon of the thermal bar in Lake Baikal and the propagation of
pollutants from the Selenga River are studied with a nonhydrostatic mathematical model. An
unsteady ﬂow is simulated by solving numerically a system of thermal convection equations
in the Boussinesq approximation using second-order implicit diﬀerence schemes in both space
and time. To calculate the velocity and pressure ﬁelds in the model, an original procedure for
buoyant ﬂows, SIMPLED, which is a modiﬁcation of the well-known Patankar and Spalding’s
SIMPLE algorithm, has been developed. The simulation results have shown that the thermal
bar plays a key role in propagation of pollution in the area of Selenga River inﬂow into Lake
Baikal.
Keywords: pollutant transport, thermal bar, numerical modelling, Lake Baikal, Selenga River

Introduction

The mechanisms of natural convection in freshwater ecosystems are of great scientiﬁc and practical interest, in particular in relation to human impacts on the environment. In particular, the
thermal bar phenomenon can greatly aﬀect the processes of pollutant propagation in freshwater
bodies. A thermal bar is a narrow zone in a lake in temperate latitudes where maximum-density
waters sink from the surface to the bottom. Our understanding of thermal bars in deep lakes is
still scant: there are sparse observational data and very few high-accuracy mathematical models to describe hydrodynamic processes in deep lakes in given hydrological and meteorological
conditions. The propagation of Selenga river water in the shallow coastal band of Lake Baikal
during the spring-summer warming was numerically studied by T.E. Ovchinnikova and O.B.
Bocharov [3] and P.R. Holland et al. [1], but these authors did not consider the relationship
between river inﬂow and pollution spread. A major source of pollution in Lake Baikal is its

largest tributary, the Selenga, providing over 50% of the total river runoﬀ. About 60% of the
total pollution in Baikal is brought by the Selenga. Therefore, it is important to assess some
qualitative characteristics of pollutant transport from the Selenga River to Lake Baikal. Also
in this part of the lake the thermal bar is most pronounced during the spring-summer warming,
and its eﬀects are most suitable for numerical simulation.
The aim of the present paper is to numerically simulate the “river - lake” interaction and
study the impact of the spring riverine thermal bar on pollutant propagation in Lake Baikal.

Governing equations

We consider hydrodynamic processes in a cross-section perpendicular to the shore of a deep lake.
We take coordinates x, y, z in the oﬀshore, alongshore and vertical directions respectively, with
u, v, w as the respective velocity components. Our nonhydrostatic mathematical model, which
includes the Coriolis force due to Earth’s rotation, is written in the Boussinesq approximation

Here Ωx , Ωy , and Ωz are the vector components of Earth’s rotation angular velocity; g
is the acceleration of gravity; cp is the speciﬁc heat capacity; T is the temperature; S is the
salinity; C is the pollutant concentration; p is the pressure; ρ0 is the water density at standard
atmospheric pressure, temperature TL , and salinity SL (TL and SL are a reference temperature
and salinity of the lake, respectively). To close the system of equations, a two-parameter k − ω
model of turbulence developed by D.C. Wilcox [7] is used. Absorption of shortwave radiation
Hsol is calculated according to the Bouguer-Lambert-Beer law. The Chen-Millero equation,
adopted by UNESCO, was taken as the equation of state ρ = ρ (T, S, p).

Initial and boundary conditions

Initial conditions for equations are
u = 0; v = 0; w = 0; T = TL ; S = SL ; C = 0; k = 0; ω = ωL at t = 0,
where TL , SL are the initial temperature and salinity in the lake, respectively, and t is the time.
On all solid boundaries, conditions of no-slip and zero ﬂux of scalar variables are set. At
the free surface, a wind stress condition is used in conjunction with the rigid lid approximation.
Heating of the lake is simulated with shortwave, longwave, sensible, latent heat ﬂuxes, predicted
on real local weather conditions. On the open boundary special numerical conditions of the
radiation type are speciﬁed.

Numerical method

The above-formulated problem is solved by a ﬁnite volume method. The scalar quantities
(temperature, salinity, etc.) are calculated in the center of a grid cell, and the velocity vector
components at the mid-points of the cell boundaries. To approximate the lake coastal proﬁle,
a method of blocking of ﬁctitious domains [4] is used: the velocity components in a dead zone
are set to zero by using large values of the viscosity coeﬃcients in this zone.
The numerical algorithm for ﬁnding the ﬂow and temperature ﬁelds is based on a CrankNicholson diﬀerence scheme. The convective terms in the equations are approximated with a
second-order upstream scheme, QUICK.
To calculate the velocity and pressure ﬁelds, a procedure for buoyant ﬂows, SIMPLED
(Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations with Density correction), which is a
modiﬁcation of the well-known Patankar’s method SIMPLE [4], has been developed. The
algorithm of SIMPLED is based on a cyclic “prediction-correction” sequence and takes into
account density correction in the buoyancy term in comparison with the algorithm SIMPLE.
The systems of grid equations at each time step are solved by the relaxation method with
red-black ordering and using of OpenMP programming tools for multicore processors.
The numerical algorithm has been tested for the case of a square cavity with isothermal
lateral boundaries. Also, the results of mathematical simulation of the thermal bar in Lake
Kamloops by this method [6] are in good agreement with the results of calculations performed
by P.R. Holland et al.

Results and Discussion

The Srednyaya arm (Selenga mouth) - Buguldeika cross-section (see Figure 1), near the boundary between the southern and central basins of Lake Baikal, was taken for the study. Bottom
topography data for this cross-section were taken from a bathymetrical electronic map of Lake
Baikal [5]. The Selenga shallow water basin is located between 51.9◦ - 52.5◦ N. and 106.1◦ 106.9◦ E.: from the southern part of Istoksky Sor to Cape Oblom.
A uniform value TL = 3◦ C is taken as the initial temperature distribution in Lake Baikal in
the calculations. The initial water temperature in the Selenga River is 5◦ C. The temperature of
the river water increases by 0.4◦ C every day, which corresponds to the real temperature regime
in May. The river ﬂows into the lake at a velocity of 0.015 m/s. The water mineralization in the
lake is SL = 0.096 g/kg, whereas it linearly increases from 0.140 g/kg to 0.150 g/kg in the river.

river outﬂow (at the left of the domain) is 15 m deep. The calculation domain (see Figure 1c) is
covered by a uniform orthogonal grid with dimensions hx = 50 m and hz = 5 m. The time step
Δt = 60 s. The calculations are made with a Tomsk State University supercomputer “SKIF
Cyberia”.
The overall dynamics of pollutant propagation in the zone of Selenga inﬂow into Lake Baikal
is presented in Figure 2. We assume that the pollutants dissolved in the water are neutrally
buoyant, so they neither rise to the surface nor are they deposited on the bed. Figure 2 shows
that on the 5th day water with a pollutant concentration of 90% of the level in the river reaches
a distance of 2.6 km from the Selenga mouth; on the 10th day, it reaches 4 km; on the 20th
day, 6 km, and on the 30th day, 7.2 km. There is a clear tendency of the pollutant to move
down the slope in accordance with the thermal bar evolution. Thus, it can be concluded that
the thermal bar plays a key role in pollution propagation in the zone of Selenga inﬂow into
Lake Baikal. Hubbard and Spain [2] have similarly observed that the propagation of dissolved
materials from river runoﬀ in Lake Superior is controlled by the thermal bar in spring.

Conclusions

With the above nonhydrostatic numerical model, the major thermohydrodynamic processes
related to the thermal bar dynamics in the vicinity of the Selenga inﬂow into Lake Baikal have
been simulated. The numerical experiments have shown that the incoming river water (which
diﬀers from the lake water in mineralization and temperature) contributes to the formation of
the thermal bar and its further movement to the center of the lake. A simulation of the propagation of pollutants coming with the Selenga waters has shown that this is closely correlated
with the thermal bar development. The dynamics of pollutant propagation in the area of Selenga inﬂow into Lake Baikal shows that on the 30th day water with a pollutant concentration
of 90% of the level in the river reaches a distance of 7.2 km from the Selenga mouth.
