Abstract
We have investigated the solvation shell dynamics of Na+ and Cl- ion pairs in water - DMSO mixtures of three
compositions with xDMSO (mole fraction of DMSO) = 0.21, 0.35 and 0.48. Dynamical ion pair trajectories in these
compositions are studied to analyze the diffusional behaviour of the solvent molecules in the primary and secondary
solvation shells as well as the bulk solvent. As expected, the diffusivity of the primary solvation shells is smaller than the
bulk. The insertion of solvent molecules in the region between the ion pairs during the ion pair separation process is
analyzed from the classical ion pair molecular dynamics trajectories in these compositions of water DMSO mixtures.

1. Introduction
The solvent mixtures of water and DMSO have a unique chemical and biological importance. Water-DMSO mixture
is widely used as a cryo-preservative. These mixtures show maximum deviation from ideal behavior in the DMSO
mole fraction range of 0.20 to 0.45 [1 - 5]. It has been shown experimentally that the water-DMSO hydrogen bond is
much stronger than the water-water hydrogen bond, which could be one of the major reasons for these macroscopic
deviations [6 - 7]. The associative properties of DMSO responsible for non-idealities in DMSO-water systems are
also found in its associations with polarizable non-ionic and ionic substances.
Associative character of DMSO and its influence on ion solvation were probed by studying the solvation of Na+ Clion pair in the presence of several DMSO-water mixtures with xDMSO (mole fraction of DMSO) = 0.10, 0.21, 0.35,
0.48 and 0.91 [8 - 12]. The investigations reported the existence of two solvent separated ion pairs (SSIPs) of NaCl
in DMSO-water mixture with xDMSO = 0.21 and broad SSIPs in other mixture compositions and the appearance of a
strong CIP (contact ion pair) as the mole fraction of DMSO approaches 1.

As the ion pair separates, solvent molecules get inserted in the region between the ion pair. For charged ions,
primary solvent shell (the first solvent layer surrounding the ions) is expected to be long lived and the molecules
“bound” in this region are expected to be far more sluggish compared to the bulk molecules. This behaviour extends
to biomolecules such as proteins wherein there is evidence for the existence of two types of solvents, one bound to
the biomolecule and the other, a lot more mobile [13-18]. In these biological systems, there have been a large
number of studies analyzing the differences in the diffusional behaviour of locally bound solvent molecules and the
non local labile solvent molecules. The structural and equilibrium behavior of this Na+ Cl- ion pair has been
investigated in sufficient detail in the earlier studies [9-12]. In the present paper, we investigate the relative
dynamics of the two solvation regions and the insertion of molecules from the more mobile region to the tightly
bound region. The methodology is given in Section 2. The results are described in Section 3 followed by concluding
remarks in Section 4.

2. Methodology and the potential models
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is an efficient technique to investigate the microscopic behaviour of liquids,
electrolyte solutions and interfacial fluids and to relate the molecular correlation functions to macroscopic behaviour
[19 - 20]. The principles used for these simulations entirely depend on classical mechanics. The molecules under
investigation are supposed to be confined in a cubical box. The initial configurations and velocities of the molecules
are specified. In each step of the simulation, configurations and velocities of the particles are stored. The equation of
motions for N particle system is solved numerically by using a standard algorithm discussed below.
The simulation has been performed by treating the interaction between the various components to be composed of
pair wise additive potentials. The site-site ion-solvent and solvent – solvent potential is represented as
Uαβ(r) = (A αβ / r12) - (C αβ / r6) + (qα qβ / r)

( 1)

Where α and β denotes a pair of interaction sites on different molecules, r is the site separation, qα is a point charge
located at site α. The terms Aαβ and Cαβ are given by
Aαβ = 4 εαβ (σαβ)12

( 2)

Cαβ = 4 εαβ (σαβ)6
( 3)
Where εαβ and σαβ are the energy and the distance parameters in the Lennard-Jones potential. The cross interactions
have been obtained by using the Lorentz-Berthelot rules.

σαβ =

1
(σαα +σββ )
2

εαβ = (εααεββ )1/2

(5)

Now, the force on each particle/site is calculated from the relation,
Fα = −

In this report we have used the SPC/E model of water and the P1 model of DMSO. The molecularity of the solvents
is kept intact by using molecular dynamics with constraints on intra-atomic distances in the molecules. The details
of the solvent parameters are given in Table 1 [9].

The P1 model of DMSO which is used in the present work differs considerably from the P2 model in that the charge
on S in P1model ( 0.54e ) is nearly four times the charge of the P2 model ( 0.139e) and the methyl groups in P1 are
uncharged. The energy parameter of methyl in P1 is also twice that of the P2 model. We have already shown that the
potentials of mean force are not significantly influenced by the model differences [9], while the P1 model gives
better diffusion coefficients.
We have performed extensive MD simulations on systems containing sodium and chloride ions in mixtures of water
and DMSO for the DMSO mole fractions of 0.21, 0.35 and 0.48. The simulation box lengths (L) and solvent
densities (ρ) and the solvent particle numbers (N1 and N2) are given in Table 2. Over 100 ps simulations were done
for each composition using the Verlet algorithm and SHAKE algorithm to keep the intra-atomic distances in the
solvents fixed. Representative results over a 10 ps duration are given in the results section. Different initial
configurations such as only DMSO molecules surrounding the ions and only water molecule surrounding the ions as
well as a random configuration of both molecules were used as starting points. The results relevant to the present
problem are presented in the next section.

3. Results and Discussions
We begin with the dynamical ion pair trajectories. Representative ion pair trajectories for a period of 10 ps are
shown for the three water DMSO compositions in Fig. 1. The curve for of xDMSO = 0.21 is shown in black, the curve
for of xDMSO = 0.35 is shown in red and the curve for of xDMSO = 0.48 is shown in green. The curve for xDMSO =
0.21 is the least diffusive settling near the 5 Å region, while the curves for the other two compositions are more
diffusive and span the distance range of 4 Å to 10 Å. A plot of the residence times (shown in Fig. 2) gives a better

picture of the dynamical ion association process. The xDMSO = 0.21 curve shows a transient 3 Å peak which is more
of a remnant of the initial interionic separation and the trajectories beyond the first 10 ps bear this out. The curve for
xDMSO = 0.35 shows two SSIPs, one at 4.5 Å and the other at 8.5 Å. The curve for xDMSO = 0.48 also shows two
SSIPs, one at 5 Å and another at 7.5 Å. The occurrence of two solvent separated regions allows us to explore the
microscopic details of the insertion of solvent molecules in the interionic region as the ion pair separates out.

Before analyzing this process, we present the details of the diffusional behaviour of different solvation shells around
the ions as well the bulk solvent. The solvent within the first peak of the respective site site radial distribution is
referred to as the solvent in the primary (contact) solvation layer, the layer immediately outside it is referred to as
the secondary solvation layer and the rest of the solvent is referred to as the bulk. Figures 3, 4 and 5 show the mean
square displacements of the solvent molecules in the primary and secondary solvent shells and the bulk solvent.
The bulk solvent is shown in black colour, primary solvation shell is shown in green colour and the secondary
solvation shell is shown in red colour. Figure 3 shows the mean square displacement data for xDMSO = 0.21, Fig. 4
shows the data for xDMSO = 0.35 and Fig. 5 shows the data for xDMSO = 0.48.

It is observed that in general, the diffusion coefficients (given in Table 3) of the primary shells are less than half of
that of the bulk for both solvents. The values of the secondary shell diffusion coefficients are in between values of
the primary shell and the bulk. There is greater uncertainly in the values of the secondary shell diffusion coefficients
because it is a bit harder to define the region of the secondary shell due to the peaks in the radial distribution
functions being a lot broader. It is also difficult to obtain the solvent diffusion coefficients around the ion pair
experimentally, but the bulk values are close to the experimental values of the individual diffusion coefficients [21].
The diffusion coefficients of the three regions are larger for the composition with xDMSO = 0.35. This is due to the
ion pair dynamical trajectory for this composition being the most diffusive covering the range between at 2.5 Å and
10 Å. The primary shell around the ion pair is found to consist of about 7 to 8 molecules at the ion pair separation
of 4.5 Å and 9 to 10 molecules at an ion pair separation of 7 Å. The distance criteria used for identifying the
primary solvation shell is 3 Å from the sodium ion (due to its more compact solvation and also by taking into
consideration the location of the peak in the sodium oxygen pair correlation function) and 4 Å for the chloride ion.
For the secondary solvation shell, the ion solvent distances used are 5.5 Å for the sodium ion and 6.5 Å for the
chloride ion. We use the oxygen sites of both molecules for identifying the solvent shells. We have also considered
the distances of the other solvent sites from the ions to ensure that the primary shell is directly in contact with the
ions.
It is found that molecules in the primary solvation shell as well as the secondary shell enter the interionic region as
the ion pair separates. For the first composition (xDMSO = 0.21), the diffusion constant of the water molecule coming
into the interionic region from the secondary solvation shell is 1.70 (10-9 m2 s-1) and that of a water molecule coming
in from the primary solvation region is 2.20 ( 10-9 m2 s-1). For the composition xDMSO = 0.48, an incoming DMSO

E. Pradhan, B.L. Tembe / Procedia Computer Science 1 (2012) 1165–1173

molecule from the secondary solvation shell has a diffusion constant of 1.41 (10-9 m2 s-1). For a similar water
molecule, the diffusion constant is 2.3 (10-9 m2 s-1). In the composition xDMSO = 0.35, a water molecule which was in
the primary solvation shells of both ions comes in between the ions with a diffusion constant of 2.48 (10-9 m2 s-1).
We thus see that the values of the diffusion coefficients of these incoming molecules range from the values of the
secondary shell molecules and the bulk values. Just as there are incoming molecules there are a few outgoing
molecules as well. For the incoming molecules, the statistics can not be as good as the bulk as there are so few
molecules in the intersolvent region. Yet, it is nice to see that we get physically meaningful results from these
representative simulations. While there are several experimental and theoretical observations for pure solvent
diffusion coefficients [22-28], the data for mixtures is not available in such abundance.

Fig. 6. Radial distribution functions of ions with the sites in DMSO and water in the mixture with xDMSO = 0.21.
Finally, we show in Fig. 6, the radial distribution functions of the ions with different sites of water and DMSO
molecules. These are obtained in simulations with larger box lengths in the present work. It is reassuring that the
radial distribution functions obtained in the present work with larger box lengths of nearly 30 Å with over 400
molecules are quite similar to those obtained earlier with smaller box lengths and around 250 molecules [10, 12].
For the other two compositions, the results are again similar to the earlier results and are not reproduced here.
Representative solvent separated ion pair configurations are shown in Fig. 7. Chloride ion is shown as a green
sphere and sodium ion is shown as a violet sphere. Two DMSO molecules are on the periphery. In the ion pair on
the left [Fig. 7(a)], there is only one solvent molecule in the region between the ion pair as the interionic distance is
4.8 Å. In the ion pair on the right [Fig. 7(b)], there are two water molecules in the region between the ion pair as the
interionic distance is 7.2 Å

Chloride ion is shown as a green sphere and sodium ion is shown as a violet sphere. Oxygen of water as well as
DMSO is shown as a red sphere and the sulphur of DMSO is shown as a yellow sphere. The picture on the left (a) is
at an ion pair distance of 4.8 Å. Among the eight solvent molecules (6 water molecules and 2 DMSO molecules)
there is one water molecule between the ion pair. The picture on the right (b) is for an ion pair separation of 7.2 Å. A
total of nine solvent molecules are seen. Two DMSO molecules are on the periphery and two of the seven water
molecules are seen in the region between the ions.
4. Conclusions
We have calculated the Na+ Cl- ion pair trajectories in three compositions of water-DMSO mixtures. In these
compositions (the DMSO mole fraction ranging of 0.20 to 0.50), deviations from idealities are the largest. The
residence times of the ion pair at different distances can be easily used to ascertain the existence of the contact ion
pair and the solvent separated ion pair. In general, solvent separated ion pairs are found to be predominant and two
distinct solvent separated in pairs can be identified from the regional residence time plots. The solvation shells are
not rigid and as the ion pair diffuses out, other solvent molecules get inserted between the ion pair either by rotation
of the primary solvation shell or by the insertion of the solvent molecules into the interionic region from the
secondary solvation shells. We find examples of both these kinds of insertions in our simulations and the diffusion
coefficients of these incoming molecules are generally smaller than the bulk diffusion coefficients of the solvents.
The values of the diffusion coefficients of the molecules in the primary solvation shell are less than half of the bulk
values. In several biological systems, the ratios of the primary solvation shell diffusion coefficients are even smaller
(relative to the bulk). The ion pairs span the distance range of 3 Å to 10 Å regions in a time span of 10 ps. Contact
ion pairs (ion pair distance of 3Å) are found very infrequently. It is reassuring that the radial distribution functions
obtained in the present work with larger box lengths of nearly 30 Å with over 400 molecules are quite similar to
those obtained earlier with smaller box lengths and around 250 molecules. We are investigating similar details in
compositions wherein the mole fraction of one of the components is much larger. The results with 91% DMSO
would be of special interest as this composition shows a significant presence of the contact ion pair.
